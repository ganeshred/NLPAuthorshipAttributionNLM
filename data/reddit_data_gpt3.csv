"0","CMV: Demanding ""Asian people"" to have better grades than other ""races"" to be accepted to universities is inherently racist","Edit:I talk about the fact that Asian applicants need to get (statistically) higher SAT scores to get into Ivy League schools if it was not clear.https://nypost.com/2018/10/17/harvards-gatekeeper-reveals-sat-cutoff-scores-based-on-race/First, let me say it's just my initial opinion.I am not American, so I was surprised when I heard of it.I don't think I have ever seen a double standard worse than this idea.It divides people into race groups by definition (and race is just a fake generalization we invented & should be ignored, use social status or living areas instead if you want more fairness).Look, one of the proposed definitions of racism is:""of, relating to, or characterized by the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another.""Now, I see that diversity is celebrated in the USA, which is great, but I feel like people who think they understand why it's ok to give some groups an advantage or disadvantage in acceptance based on race, just spit things they read on Instagram and have no idea what racism is, which makes me perceive them as ignorant people who should not be taken seriously. Moreover, I am convinced this population (of people which I perceive as lacking critical thinking, i.e. celebrate diversity but encourage racism) can get brainwashed to be racist on more significant occasions, if it would come using the right politically correct terms, with the right delivery, from the right celebrity. Basically, a herd of sheep.If you think this way of enforcing diversity is acceptable, please change my view. I might be unaware of some ideas.","This is an inherently racist statement, because it stereotypes an entire race of people in a negative way. It implies that Asian people are smarter than other races and that this is a desirable trait. This is a tired argument that is definitely not going to fly in 2017."
"1","CMV: Eating your lunch on the toilet is a disgusting habit.","I have a coworker who does this and it's pretty much his daily habit. He keeps a cafeteria style lunch tray in his office. Nearly every day at around noon, he set his lunch out on his tray, takes it into the bathroom, goes into one of the stalls, and does his business/eats lunch over the course of a half hour or so.I can see under the stall that he has his pants down too, so it's not like he's just sitting in the stall for isolation purposes (which would still be gross, in my opinion).This is not any sort of personal vendetta and I don't hate the guy. In fact, I otherwise like him. He is good at his job and always does his fair share of the work. In general, he comes across as a kind and generous person.But this habit of his is just plain disgusting.Eating food in the bathroom is disgusting. I could make a few small exceptions for cases where you already had a piece of hard candy (like a jolly rancher) in your mouth before walking in or something like that, but taking an actual meal in with you and eating while sitting on the toilet is unsanitary and unappetizing.","This is a disgusting habit. Eating your lunch on the toilet is not only unsanitary, but also it is rude to other people who may be trying to use the toilet."
"2","CMV: Megamind was morally justified in catfishing Roxanne Richie","Hey guys! Megamind is one of my favorite movies of all time, and over many rewatches, I’ve cultivated the opinion in the title. I can’t really blame Megamind for lying to Roxanne like he did. A few reasons come to mind:1. He originally didn’t intend to lie. He pretended to be someone else to covertly blow up the Metroman statue, and ended up rolling with it when he bonded with Roxanne. If he had set out with the intention of getting Roxanne to fall in love with him, that would change my view. 2. He was right when he said that his blue skin and distinctive appearance would ruin his romantic chances. To me, what Megamind did isn’t much morally different than someone getting plastic surgery and not revealing that history to suitors. I don’t think that’s wrong to do, either.3. Roxanne (nor anyone else) wouldn’t have bothered to learn what Megamind’s past and true personality were like if they knew they were talking to Megamind (based on his actions of, you know, taking over the city).I think Megamind was well and truly trapped by his exterior and his persona as “the villain,” and the only way to escape it was to lie about who he was. If you feel differently, please share your thoughts :)Things that will most likely change my view, though, are going to be evidence against points 1, 2, and 3, though.","Megamind was justified in catfishing Roxanne Richie because he made her believe that he was a real person and she would have a better chance of winning the contest. Roxanne Richie was not truthful with Megamind, so he was justified in deceiving her."
"3","CMV: I don't see why a chef or cook needs to understand or respect the 'culture' from where a recipe came from.","I think that this is something I once heard Gordon Ramsay say, where a person asked him ""Does a chef need to respect the culture that a food comes from?"" To which Gordon answered 'Yes, absolutly . Chef's have a responsibility to do so.'I don't see why this is the case. Food is food. Just because a culture far away from you came up with a certain kind of food doesn't mean that I owe it to that culture or those people to understand anything, or even respect anything about them.Much of our modern mathematics is based on thinkers from the Golden Age of Islam, who's work was taken from the greeks, and then would go on to influence later mathematicians. But I sure as heck do not need, nor would anyone say that I am obligated to learn Islamic or Arabic history, learn anything about the Islamic religion, learn any arabic, or even know the names of the specific mathematics who's techniques I'm learning.I mean sure I know the name Pythagoras, but I couldn't tell you anything about him beyond that he was Greek and probably a pagan. And he's the *only* one who's name I even know. There are probably hundreds of other mathematicians who's work informed what I was taught in school, and I don't need to know about any of them.Why should food be any different? Why would I need to give a crap about anything regarding Thai history/culture to realize that orange, spice, and cashews are a fantastic combo? Why would I need to learn anything about Italy to appreciate a good pasta and red wine?I'm not saying it's *bad* to know these things of course. A richer understanding of history and the world around you is a good thing in and of itself. But it's not any kind of *obligation*. So I don't see a problem with a chef cooking 'authentic' cuisines and having zero interest in learning about that part of the world."," It's not necessary.I totally agree. I think that a cook or chef can simply follow the recipe and enjoy the end product."
"4","CMV: The government should not be the arbiter of marriage.","One thing that I have found lacking in the gay marriage debates over the years is the following POV: Marriage in general is none of the government’s damn business. Growing up in a purple (politically mixed) area in the 90s, there were some vicious debates around gay marriage. I found the right wing position deplorable. I also think everyone was missing the point. My takeaway was: why do ANY of us need to ask the Man for permission? I’m 37m, straight, cisgendered and now married. USA. I say this to acknowledge that no one has ever tried to limit my ability to get married, so I’m missing this perspective. My much younger brother is soon to be married to his long time bf. In a liberal state, there haven’t been any issues. I can see how I might be missing the fact that validation from the State might be important to a gay couple given a long history of (and current) discrimination. I can empathize with the value of the symbolism, but still believe personal relationships never should have been within the government’s purview. I’m sure there are other arguments out there for government involvement. I’m not aware of them; hence, my post. Anticipating counter-arguments: One could claim that stable family systems (marriage) are good for society, and therefore should be encouraged through tax structures. I can follow this line of thinking to a point. However, I am skeptical that the government is tangibly altering the nature of relationships through tax incentives. My wife and I have been married 15 years precisely for tax reasons. But we’d still be sitting here in the same dedicated relationship, in the same home, with the same number of kids, than if the government didn’t push us into signing papers. I am against state-sanctioned gay marriage in the same way I am against state-sanctioned straight marriage. I fail to understand why I had to go pay X amount as a fee for some bureaucrat to stamp his approval on my relationship. It’s nice for taxes, but it seems silly to pay less because the Man likes my relationship choices. It seems silly they have thoughts of any kind. I feel very strongly that it is not the role of government to define “marriage”, and sanction individual relationships. This conclusion feels simple to me. But most issues are complex; my level of conviction is probably a sign that I am missing a lot. What am I missing? Please CMV.","This is a difficult question. On one hand, the government should not be in the business of deciding who can and cannot get married. This is a matter for individuals and their families to decide. On the other hand, the government has a role to play in ensuring that all eligible individuals have the opportunity to get married. If a person is unable to marry because of a disability, for example, the government should provide support and assistance to enable that person to marry."
"5","CMV: The movie ""The One"" has the best ending for a hero and villain in any entertainment media","\*\*\*Spoilers for the movie ""The One"" for anyone concerned about that\*\*\*I definitely haven't consumed all books, TV shows, and movies out there, but at least of all those that I have seen and read, The One has the best ending for its hero and villain.For anyone who hasn't seen The One, the hero and villain are both played by Jet Li.  The villain seeks to kill the last version of himself in the multiverse in order to become all powerful.  The hero starts out not even knowing the multiverse exists, but ends up needing to survive against his other-self.  Both characters are incredibly powerful already because the strength of all their alternate selves the villain killed have been poured into them.In the midst of the fighting between the two, the hero loses his wife.Normally in a movie like this, there is a winner and a loser, and in some ways there is here too, but with a twist.  The hero gets sent to a new universe where he appears in a very idealized version of Los Angeles which has clean streets, nice people, and most importantly for the hero, a different version of his wife which he meets at the end, presumably to live happily ever after with.  The villain is sent to a penal colony in a very gloomy and dark world.  At the center of the area is a temple which seems to be the place the strongest criminals occupy the top of.  As the movie comes to a close it shows the unnaturally strong villain character making his claim to the top of the temple as he fights the other inmates while the track ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach plays.I've never walked away from a show or book thinking that if it continued on that we'd see both the hero and villain living their best lives, but I felt that way as this movie faded to black.  I believe that this is the best ending for a hero and villain duo in any entertainment media, but I'm interested in seeing if anyone can change my view :)","The ending of The One has the best possible outcome for both the hero and the villain. The hero is able to save everyone, and the villain is killed."
"6","CMV: ""Protest"" and ""Punitive"" voting is harmful","Since I don't reside in my country of birth and thus don't follow the local politics as much, for the past several elections i have resorted to an online tool that simply asks me a bunch of policy questions and tells me which of the parties' programs matches it best and picked what it tells me to. When I told this to my parents they were mortified. They think that it would be better to not vote at all and that it's borderline anti democratic. When I asked why they said it didn't take into account if they actually MET those promises or not. What you are ""supposed"" to do is to vote for different parties or not vote if they don't give you what you want as ""punishment"". This got me on a rant because ""protest"" votes are what led to Brexit and a bunch of populists taking over. This sort of spiteful action is against the democratic process.Personally, I don't care about the human I am voting for. I wouldn't even want to know their name in a perfect world. Only policy matters, and unless you are facing a literal life or death situation like the second coming of fascism, then I don't see any reason to vote on anything that's not policy related. If the government actually does what I want, then it's not my problem and I can't do anything about it. Isn't essentially ""meta gaming"" democracy by punishing the actual actors counterproductive?","There is no evidence that either voting method is more harmful than the other. Voting is a fundamental right that citizens have, and both methods can be used to express their opinions. However, it is important to consider the consequences of each method before deciding whether to use it.While protesting voting may be effective in drawing attention to a particular issue, it can also have negative consequences. For example, protesting voting could lead to confusion or voter intimidation, which could delay or prevent people from voting. Punitive voting, on the other hand, can also have negative consequences. For example, punitive voting could lead to biased voting or results that are not representative of the overall population."
"7","CMV: The Sonic Adventure games, while admittedly fun, are vastly overrated.","I semi-recently replayed the sonic adventure games. I played the first on a whim by myself, and played most of the second in a Discord call with my friends. I had fun, we all had fun, and that was mostly it. I say semi-recently because this was about a year ago, but the SA games recently came up in a discussion I was having.I'm not really a Sonic die-hard; I owned the first game when I was younger, handed down from one relative or another, and it was fun if a tad frustrating (I didn't really mesh with the speed and it led to it feeling like trial and error). It's important to know that, because I really, genuinely had no idea the Sonic Adventure games were held up so highly within the fanbase.And in all honesty.. I simply do not get it. Are they fun? Sure, I'll give you that. But, if I'm being entirely honest, I can't rate them much higher than 'okay'. They aren't particularly challenging, they're graphically competent, and they have good music - the gameplay forms are, well a mixed bag.The Sonic segments are probably the highlight, but even then they never really escape from what I feel has always been a Sonic problem - in my limited experience - of being wonky to control outside of the scripted 'go fast' sections.My enjoyment hits a snag there, though, because I don't think the Tails/Eggman or Rouge/Knuckles segments would have been all that enjoyable if I didn't have the ability to quickly look up a guide. Controlling Rouge or Knuckles is an exercise in frustration through fairly uninteresting locals.The Tails and Eggman sequences are easily my least favourite parts of the games. To be blunt, I think anyone praising them has serious nostalgia blindness. They're pathetically easy, too long for how uninteresting they are, and I'm pretty sure they gave me tinnitus or something.I won't mention the story much here, as it was not really of interest to me, nor were the characters all that much; it wasn't really what I decided to pick them up for at the time. That said, I found most of the characters fairly annoying and by the time I was done, they were getting on my nerves, Sonic especially. I'll totally jam to the music from these games any day, but I don't really see what makes people hold these games up as classic examples of the Sonic games franchise, and I feel like I'm missing something others didn't.","I can't really argue with that, but I do think they're really good games. They're definitely not perfect, but they're really fun to play."
"8","CMV: #1 No one gender is more toxic than the other. It should be people with power many times abuse power. #2 Most toxic extremist views exist on the internet than IRL.","Disclaimer : Using men and women as the genders for conversation because I have had more opportunities interacting with these two genders. No hate please.\[#1\] I grew in a very patriarchal society/country but my dad and everyone in my family have more trust in me and encourage me than any other male child. Honestly, I did not experience this. I only saw my friends experiencing it. At the same time, my mom never complained about dad's salary which was common in some of my friends family. The toxicity I have experienced is mostly outsidea. Difficult men : I work in IT where majority of the power positions are held by men. So most toxicity I have experienced are from men, met men shaming women who wants to have a career, men who think adult women who are groomed should not be protected by law.b. Difficult Women : Women who wants to spend all the money on expensive stuffs while they don't contribute much to the family, women who spread hatred against other women, women who always criticize their partner, women who think all men out there are waiting to get them.\[#2\] When I analyze these people, most are not one dimensional. Some have unchecked bias about one specific thing because it has not been challenged or some other views that is stopping them to see reality. Very rarely they are 360 degree toxic.When I come to internet, I see comments that are so one dimensional and it is in larger number. One hating the other gender. And sometimes when I check their accounts, they have dedicated months and sometimes years commenting extremist views. But these are really smaller percentages. say 10/100 people. People who are very close to me over time have changed their views when challenged with some data and time.So here I am, change my view.FYI : I am in PST timezone. I am awake for another 30 minutes. I shall reply any comments that I would get in this time. I will be back in the morning to reply for new comments"," #3 Gender identity is not a disease."
"9","CMV: filming / streaming in gyms should be banned","All different kinds of people use gyms, right?  There are professional body builders, there are people who genuinely enjoy workouts but aren't there to try to bulk up / slim down, and of course, there are people who really don't want to be there but know that they need to do something to get healthier.  The last group, among whose ranks I used to count myself, are often extremely self conscious about just about every aspect of being there.  Not lifting heavy enough weights.  Not running fast enough on the treadmill.  Not looking as good in my crappy sweatpants and stained baggy t-shirt compared to people wearing over $100 worth of athleticwear.  And then you have people who think that the gym is their personal fitness TV studio.  If you're a streamer who doesn't care about other people in your shot, then great - now my self-conscious ass is going on the internet for all to see.  If you're a streamer who does care - way too much - about other people being in your shot, then you may end up going off on someone for simply trying to use the gym and getting in your way when all they're doing is trying to access the gym that they paid a membership for.My view is simple: gyms need to stop allowing this.  Obviously outbursts aren't allowed and actively problematic people will usually be dealt with accordingly, but why even let it get there in the first place?  Why allow recording in a room full of self-conscious, sloppily dressed people?  And let's look at it from one more angle: what about the women who show up in workout gear that is barely more than a swimsuit, because they know they get really hot during cardio and are just trying to stay cool enough to not completely hate their workout?  Maybe they don't want to be shown like that in the back of some guy's gym videos either and become the target of some creep's online harassment. Ban filming in gyms.  CMV.","There is no definitive answer to this question as there are a significant number of people who feel that filming and streaming workouts in gyms should be allowed. Additionally, there is a large group of people who feel that this type of activity should be banned because it can potentially lead to people not being able to workout as effectively. Ultimately, this is a complex issue that requires further examination."
"10","CMV: Multiculturalism has failed and we should focus on Integration instead.","I really think that countries like the US should push for immigration integration instead of multiculturalism and encouraging ""identities"". **We have been essentially creating different factions who all oppose each other. Everybody focuses their attention on ""protecting their culture"" and being ready to pounce on other American of different races. This creates a split in our nation** that other powers, like China, can easily exploit to weaken us.That's why I hate the whole idea of ""identities"". I think the only real identity should be being an American. By identifying yourself as something else you are essentially splitting the population into various factions.**If you try to preach about integrating immigrants into being an America and assimilating, they'll call you a racist and ""white-washing"" people**, which is absolutely ridiculous. If you really love your culture and tradition that much there's really no point going to America.**If you are an immigrant who tries to assimilate, other immigrants will call you a ""white-worshipper"", ""acting too white"" or a ""self-hater"", which is fucking bullshit and making everyone more toxic.**For most people, it's apparently now ""cool"" to only hang out with only people of your race and being hostile and racist to other races to ""defend your culture"" to ""fit in with your identity"". Go back to your country if you really like your ""identity"" that much. People like that don't deserve to be Americans.This is why I also hate some white people when they become racist at the wrong type of immigrant, and for all the far-right groups that only serve to further galvanize the immigrants to ""promote the culture"", refuse to assimilate and be hostile to everyone in the name of ""defending their culture.""They keep on viewing ""assimilating"" as cultural genocide and getting white washed, which I don't really see the bad point provided that most assimilated immigrants aren't the subject of stereotypes, and that it only leaves right-wing nutjobs as racists.I really think the **American immigration policy should focus on integration and assimilating people into a hegemon of real Americans, and refusing immigrants who refuse to do so, not to promote various factions of different ""identities"" ready to eat each other** up in the name of multiculturism and ""defending their traditions"".&#x200B;**CMV. Am I slowly becoming a Racist? Should I seek help? Am I wrong?**","I believe that multiculturalism has worked for many Canadian cities and has been beneficial to society as a whole. Integration, on the other hand, is a more feasible and practical solution to the current challenges faced by Canada's immigrant communities. It is important to remember that Canada is a country with a diverse population, and that a multicultural society is not a bad thing. Integration should be the objective of government policy, not multiculturalism."
"11","CMV: Researching politics and actively following the news is a waste of time","Just about anything is a better use of free time. Hanging out with friends, family, significant other, etc. Enjoying hobbies. Working out. Cooking, cleaning, doing chores. Any time you spend researching politics or catching up on the news is time you could spend doing something better. Even just relaxing and messing around on your phone is better. Even if you are going to research stuff or try to acquire knowledge, just about any subject is better than politics or the news. For starters, consuming too much information in the politics/news realm makes you more annoying. Politics is probably the worst conversation topic to have in the real world because it usually leads to counterproductive arguments, disagreements, etc. No matter what angle you are coming from, you are going to annoy some other people who disagree with you. It also makes you less interesting. People who are super into politics and the news are usually somewhat of bots / NPCs who have too many generic talking points in their head. Additionally, there is zero real benefit to it. If there is a news story that is actually important, you will end up hearing about it without having to go out of your way. It will come to you. You don't need to follow the news. When it comes to voting, you only have a limited number of choices, and it's pretty obvious who to pick based on your values and preferences. You don't need to do all this research for an easy decision. Not only that, but someone who is super well researched in politics ultimately has the same amount of voting power as someone who doesn't really care that much. You could be the ultimate debate lord, and you still only have as much power as the next random person who spends zero time researching it. Lastly, politics and the news are toxic in general. When it comes to politics, it ends up devolving into tribalism, and the more invested you are in it, the more likely you are to become tribalistic. Meanwhile, the news you hear about is mostly just bad things happening in the world, which you really don't need to know about.","There is no such thing as a waste of time when it comes to politics. In fact, following the news and researching politics can be an essential part of keeping up to date on important issues and making informed decisions."
"12","CMV: Sex is broader than Gender in USA right now as Gender is what you are assigned at birth","Here is the logic1) Sex refers to the biological attributes of a person.  While typically XY and XX, you can have stuff like Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY), SRY transposition, androgen insensitivity, and other items that create - biologically - a variety of possibilities as to what one’s sex is beyond male/female.2) Gender is a social - not an individual - construct and is how society (not the individual) classifies a person in relation to sexual differences between people.  Gender definitions can vary from society to society and time period to time period.Where people get mixed up is believing that their individual gender identification has a bearing on how society constructs their gender.  It is asserted frequently that it does (see various definitions online that assert gender identity has a bearing on gender), but there is scant evidence that society agrees.  Recent polling, from Pew back in 2022 shows that an overwhelming and increasing majority of Americans (60 vs 38 percent) say that whether a person is a man or a woman is determined by what is assigned at birth as opposed to something that can be changed later.https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/So what is the implication?  If society does not believe one can change being a man or a woman from what you are assigned at birth that means the society views gender as immutable and also as independent of one’s gender identity.  Moreover, it is some indication that society views gender as binary or at most binary with a neuter option.  And if sex is more complicated than three options and gender is at most three options with it likely being just binary then you end up with the following:Unless society recognizes a neuter option: gender is what you are assigned at birth and is narrower than your sex.To change my view on this I would need to see evidence through polling that a society in question currently regards gender as determined at least in part by self-identification.  Legal fictions and dictionary definitions that were created without examining the social construct do not count in my eyes.","This is a difficult question to answer definitively since there is no single answer that applies to every person in every place. However, it is generally agreed that the concept of 'sex' is broader than the concept of 'gender' in the United States today. This is due to the fact that people can identify with a variety of genders outside of the traditional male and female binaries. Additionally, the boundaries of what is considered 'acceptable' behaviour based on one's sex or gender can vary significantly from person to person. In some instances, people may identify as transgender or transsexual, which means that their outward appearance does not match their internal gender identity."
"13","CMV: Kindness has never actually built anything and a society could theoretically perfectly function without it and all these uplifting news or love stories are actually full of shit","I will say my biases before going in, as I think it'll make it clearer to understand where I'm coming from. I am from eastern Ukraine (the type of Donbas that was occupied in 2014), and also I have a an uncommon brain type and used to have a lot of physical health problems as a child which made raising me exhausting resourcewise and difficult. I think these are things affecting my judgement.So, the collision I'm experiencing is that now I live in one of the most developed and peaceful countries on the planet. And my therapists are doing something that's very confusing with my ""civilian reentry"", for the lack of a better word, they're teaching me all these soft unicorn fluffy values of ""kindness"", ""compassion"", ""empathy"". Like I'm not an asshole or a lowlife, i just... feel something about these words that is the reason why i'm posting here.So my opinion is that kindness, compassion, etc. actually the reason why societies fall instead of thriving. Consider basic values like freedom of speech, democracy, pretty much everything you cherish. And they exist because humans are evil by nature. Term limits, freedom of speech laws and amendments, power checks and balances exist exactly because humans are by nature tyrannical and evil, and checks need to exist because of that. And on the contrary, tyranny rises because people are politically inept and don't do anything, or equally bad, enjoy the new government because it favors them. And prety much positive news story these days is ""homeless guy works 4294967296 hours a millisecond to help his cancer girlfriend who is drowning in student loan debt"".I think kindness, compassion, and empathy actually bear a little resemblance to communism. Every time people try to build a society off of them, it falls apart because that's simply not realistic, and then advocates for kindness mop it up by saying ""That wasn't *real* kindness!""... Besides, was it kindness that freed minorities from oppression? No. Only armed resistance.","Actually, kindness has a lot of effects on society and relationships. For example, it can create a sense of community and support. Additionally, it can lead to less conflict and more cooperation."
"14","CMV: it is rude to expect others to wait to eat their hot food if you haven’t been served yet.","This only applies to hot meals, if it’s a salad or other cold item I think waiting is appropriate. But if person A orders something hot, and person B doesn’t have their order yet, it is rude to expect person A to wait while their food is getting cold. Then person B is eating fresh, hot food, while person A’s meal is not as good as it would have been. I think waiting a minute or so is fine, but if it’s apparent the meal was forgotten or going to take a long time, this applies. Even though I have been in this position as person A, I still wait because it feels taboo, but I think it’s a stupid cultural expectation. If I am the one waiting to eat I always insist everyone around me eats and I think that should be the norm. I am not so important that everyone around me should have subpar food. It’s not like I’m on the brink of starvation, I truly don’t get why this has become expected.ETA: this is coming from an experience where someone did not and would not allow others to eat even though there was a mistake and we knew their food would take a while. Someone else asked if they minded if we started and they said that it was rude to start. It seems the general consensus is that this is rude, but not common. I am also not arguing we get rid of all etiquette and social construct, I just think people don’t think enough about it and I find that odd. I really appreciate everyone’s very thoughtful responses this is so much more interesting than I thought.","There is no need to be rude to others. Wait your turn and then when your food arrives, you can enjoy it."
"15","CMV: You can be severely depressed and/or anxious without having a blatantly obvious reason, and it’s not because of character or moral defects","So I just want to start off by saying that I’ve have been diagnosed with severe clinical depression on multiple occasions, and have mild anxiety. I’ve had some small hard things, but for the most part, I’ve had a pretty affluent and smooth life.I know that I feel miserable, and that I by definition meet the standards for severe clinical depression (x amount of symptoms for most days for 2 weeks that impairs daily functioning). Even with meeting the criteria for depression, I can function somewhat well (I have friends and a job).I’ve gotten implicit and explicit messages from family, friends, coworkers, and society that mental illness isn’t real. And if they are, that only severely traumatized people get depressed or severe mental illnesses, or that there has to be this big reason for someone to have depression. And if anyone claims otherwise, they’re just lazy/selfish/wimpy. While I think that big life events is a big factor for mental illnesses, the idea of trauma is relative. What’s traumatic for me may not be traumatic for you. So it’s unfair to say that only people who go through “big” traumas can have mental illnesses.Also, genetics have some impact here. I don’t want to get in the whole nature vs nurture debate, but I feel like it’s fair to say there’s at least some genetic or physiological component to depression.And lastly, I’ve worked my butt off. I go to therapy multiple times a week, take psychiatric medications, work out daily, have a job, see friends, do daily self help stuff, have hobbies, and eat relatively well- yet I still feel deeply depressed sometimes.Tl:dr- I want/choose to believe that mental illness is real and doesn’t have to have an obvious cause. This doesn’t make the individual lazy, stupid, or whatever. And depression isn’t just a matter of sucking it up and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.

"16","CMV: Being proud or having pride is actually never your own accomplishments, it is more or less always been given to you.","First of all, I am proud of having or accepting a thought such as the above, Oh! the irony.It all feels like it's been always given to you. Some people claim that you should not be proud of your Nationality, Gender, Parent's wealth, or whatever. I'd argue that being proud of your own accomplishments such as climbing Mt. Everest, shredding an awesome guitar solo, getting the boy/girl you always wanted, winning the Nobel prize, etc. also lies in being given to you.People are always born into something/ someone. Not everyone will be born with a sharp mind, healthy body,  a nurturing environment, etc. Just by looking at people, some can be jacked, lift weights, etc. If people are so different in just muscles, how different must they be in minuscule neurons and whatnot in their brains?This seems more philosophical than it is practical but oh well, have more humility and humbleness I guess. Also, I am referring to 'Pride' and 'Proud' that people seem to throw around all the time, not more of the content, happy with something kind.  Edit: Looks like I really should have gotten more into philosophy and posted this in r/philosophy. And, I fully agree that people should be happy with their accomplishments, their life choices, ethics, enjoying their thoughts, believing in something, etc. Whether or that that is called Pride, I don't know. Guess I was not able to phrase what I wanted properly as well. Thanks for your thoughts regarding this everyone. ","Yes, this is accurate. Pride is never something that comes from within oneself - it always comes from some external source. For example, if somebody achieves something great, they may feel pride in themselves - but the pride is really just a reflection of the admiration and respect that others have for that person."
"17","CMV: QAnon was a purposeful operation attempt to create division between Americans","We've all seen the effects of QAnon.  What started on 4chan or 8chan and seems to most outsiders to be a LARP of a ""Q-level clearance"" government operative spilling state secrets (but was determined to be an account that near anyone could post upon for an unverified amount of time) and pointing a finger at a global takeover by literal Satanists had spiraled into a few offshoots with varying levels of wacky conspiratorial flare.    A) Trump was still the president, there was a legal doctrine declaring him as such.  He was going to come back into power with a military coup.    B) Same as A, but his VP of his new world was going to be a resurrected JFK Jr.???  C) A few more believable theories that simply state that the democrats are trying to eradicate American culture and Trump, and consequently a fascist regime by the political right, was the only answer.  Now, for a time, I thought this was dumb luck.  Some right-leaning people with a flare for manipulation of the more mentally ""follower"" minds found their niche.  But over time, and with whispers of ""Russian bots"" influencing elections and certain right-wing talking heads (senators and news anchors) seemingly expounding positive reactions to a White Christo-fascist Russian society with no separation of Church and State made me scratch my head.  At this time, I genuinely feel there is more to it.  This ""thought contagion"" of QAnon has certainly done some damage to American cohesiveness.  I just want someone to tell me this isn't the case, tbh.","The facts:There is no evidence that QAnon was a purposeful operation attempt to create division between Americans.

"18","CMV: There Is No Moral Justification To Not Eat Dogs That Doesn’t Also Apply To Cows And Pigs.","Edit: Sheesh sorry for all the negatives in the title. I think you get what I’m trying to say but man I must be tired lol. I say this as someone who owns a dog (and could never imagine eating him!!) and eats beef and pork. But I’m trying to think through my relationship to animals and food.I know I would have a very hard time eating a dog because:-I’ve grown up with a taboo around eating them.-I see them as pets and have developed deeply personal relationships with multiple dogs. -*Their expressions of what are clearly the dog versions of excitement, fear, and pain* provoke empathy within me.From what I can tell, there’s really no substantive difference between a dog and a cow or pig when it comes to the italicized parts of the above. It seems entirely reasonable to assume that mammals raised for food’s internal lives and inter-species relationships are just as vivid as my dog’s. Everything else has to do with my personal relationship to dogs. And I’m not sure how my personal relationship is a very morally consistent reason why they should live or be killed.Is there a moral reason why other mammals should be raised to be killed for food and not dogs? Note: please don’t say that dogs have evolved alongside us to be companion and working animals. I don’t think that’s a moral justification to raise other animals for meat and not them.Edit: maybe instead of moral I mean ethical?","The premise of this claim is that there is no moral justification to not eat certain animals, but there is a moral justification to not eat other animals. However, this does not follow. It is possible that there is a moral justification to not eat certain animals, but not to eat other animals.

You can only claim national identity if you were born in that country, or are the first generation born to natives of that country.Too many people (especially in America) try to claim a nationality or national identity based on their tenuous descent from that nationality: if it has been two or more generations since your antecedents were born in Ireland, then you are not Irish. Otherwise, I may as well claim that I’m a Native American, as my great great great grandfather was an Arapaho who performed in Buffalo Bill’s Rough Riders show; or that I am Danish because my mother’s family come from west Scotland, and are descended from Viking settlers.**Edit**: So, the main view seems to be that saying ‘I am Irish’ is seen as a shorthand for ‘I have Irish heritage and partial ethnicity’. I get that it’s easier to say, but to British and Irish ears, the former is a direct statement taken at face value.**Edit 2**: A *lot* of responses here boils down to the idea that, somehow, American English language conventions are more correct and more important than actual English language conventions.

"20","cmv: set point theory is real -- once you get fat it's more or less permanent","I would very much like to get my view changed on this, but haven't really found a much debate regarding this.For those who don't know, set-point theory basically says that once someone has gained a certain amount of weight that has been kept on for an extended period of time, the body will not (over the long term) allow the body to stay at that weight. This relates to metabolism etc. although I don't really understand the biological aspect of it.I don't think many here would doubt that theres some level of bounce back effect with weight and metabolism, but the question is can that be overcome?Anecdotally this has been my observation. I've never met someone who was obese and developed into athletic or skinny shape for the long haul. I think at the high ends it can work, like sure maybe a 400 pound person can become a 300 pound person in the long haul, or maybe someone can lose 20 pounds and keep it off but it seems nobody obese can become skinny.I read one viral clickbait story of a bodybuilder who became obese and lost it as a challenge so he could relate to his patients, but I don't think something like this would disprove it as he wasn't obese long enough for a ""set-point"" to develop.It's certainly possible that it's possible, but just extremely difficult. The same way 95% of businesses fail, simply because it's hard and not because theres some biological reason for it. But i've yet to see any counterexamples. Does anyone have any?

"21","CMV: Whilst learning about lived experience is important, deferring to people for answers on what one should or shouldn't do, purely because of their unchosen characteristics, is illogical and ironically bigoted."," Hi All, I appreciate getting feedback from people who are involved in an issue, but there's a worryingly ever growing trend of deferring to people purely because of their unchosen characteristics, instead of the quality of their logic, the evidence they provide, and their ethical reasoning, and that's what we should always be basing our decisions off of, not the speaker's characteristics, etc.   (For those who don't know, unchosen characteristics refers to any aspect of a person that they did not choose; e.g., sex, race, sexuality, birthplace etc.).   After all there is no universal consensus on *any* issue on the planet held by such groups, and if someone assumed otherwise, that would be incredibly bigoted.   As there is no universal consensus, there will always be disagreements that require additional criteria to discern the quality of the argument; e.g. ""Two X-group people are saying opposite things. How do I decide who to listen to?"" And the answer is: the quality of their logic, the evidence they provide, and their ethical reasoning. Which of course means, that often the whole exercise is a pointless one in the first place, as we should be prioritising our capacity for understanding logic, evidence and ethics, not listening to X person for the sole reason that they have Y unchosen characteristics.   I think that listening to lived experience is important, re: listening to lived experience (e.g. all X groups experience Y problem that Z group wasn't aware of); but that's not the same as deferring to people on decision making because of their unchosen characteristics.   I try to have civil, productive discussions, but that's getting harder and harder these days.   For those who appreciate civil dialogue, feel free to skip this; for those who don't; I humbly ask that you refrain from personal attack (it's irrelevant to the question), ask clarifying questions instead of assuming, stay on topic, answer questions that are asked of you, and as the above points to:   \-Provide evidence for claims that require it   \-Provide logical reasoning for claims that require it   \-Provide ethical reasoning for claims that require it   I will not engage with uncivil people here.","This is a valid point. In the case of sexual health, for example, it is important for people to listen to and respect their own body and experiences, despite any personal characteristics they may have.

"22","cmv: government flags have no good purpose in the current era","recently i have been into a flag-designing kick and it has made me reflect on why we have flags at all. i thought about how the original flags might have come about and their purpose. i thought about what they represent and how they represent those things. no matter how much i have thought about it i can think of no good reason why a person should be loyal to a flag that represents a city or state. in the best cases, you might fly a flag that represents your ideals, there are lots of those. they make some sense but even then it is the epitome of virtue signaling. that is to say that flying such a flag does nothing to support that cause, it simply associates you with that cause with almost zero effort or support.lastly, flying a flag is loud. it is screaming to the world that you are your association and it makes me not want to associate with you even if i like the cause or government but especially if i don't like the cause or government.now, when i see people flying various flags i cannot help but think that they are people that i just don't want to be around.pretty much the only thing i like about flags now is the challenge of creating an attractive flag that does a good job of representing a region or idea (assuming a flag can even do that). after i have created the flag i feel icky for having wasted my time. in order for me to accept challenges to my view, i must preemptively admit that i could be looking at this wrong and that if i am looking at this wrong it would be better for me to know. be kind.","There is no clear consensus on what good purpose government flags could serve in the current era.

"23","CMV: sex education should become more open","Disclaimer: I'm writing from Israel and was raised here. I have a bit of experience living in USA too. So that's my perspective.I think sex education is really bad, even nowadays with all the talk about being the importance of being open with feelings and good communication.Sex will always be somewhat embarrassing to talk with our parents, it's not an easy subject for sure. Nonetheless, I think it is crucial to talk with kids about it.The school is a place that should give life skills, in addition to profession skills like mathematics and English. If it wasn't saw, you might as well argue to also cancel the humanities in school (though a small portion of society can earn a living from it - academia, writers, etc.). Hence I believe that a crucial aspect of human life like sex should be talked more about, even if it's very embarrassing. Of course, rules should be enforced so discussions don't slide to problematic areas. As a teenager, I had a class on sexual education. It went like : 1. use condoms. 2. sexual diseases. 3. sexual harassment, consent and rape.As many before me said, it's important to speak of the importance of pleasure for both; the importance of feeling good with your body; toxic relationships (for men and women, in hetero-relationships or gay, etc.); the anxiety it might provoke and how to live a good sex life."," and inclusiveYes, there should be more open and inclusive sex education in schools. Sex education should be based on the best scientific information available, and should be inclusive of all genders and orientations. Sex education should also be age-appropriate, and should cover topics such as consent, contraception, and safe sex."
"24","cmv: No religion has epistemically better arguments or evidence for its claims than the others.","I am an agnostic atheist - I consider that no religion has met the burden of proof on its claims. Note that this is not a positive claim of ""there is no god"", I don't know if there is one or not (that's the agnostic part) but I don't believe any one exists (that's the atheist part). There are some gods that I actively believe don't exist (like the god that answers every prayer immediately by doing what the person that prays asks for, since I just prayed for a sandwich and didn't get it), others I don't believe exist merely by lack of sufficient evidence or clear definition. Finally, there are what I call ""left-big-toeists"", who define something that exists as a god so they can claim god exists - pantheists who don't think the universe (as a whole) is conscious, sun worshipers, ""god is a feeling"" people, etc. I am sorry, but in order for something to be eligible to the ""god"" label in  my eyes, it has to at least be able of independent thought and action that disobeys the usual laws of physics (those are necessary, but not sufficient, requirements). Left-big-toeists don't convince me.&#x200B;For the purpose of this post, I'll consider ""religious claims"" only claims that would detectably contradict a naturalistic model of the universe.&#x200B;I have been active in religious discussion / debate communities for years now, before I discovered reddit even. When engaging with theists of different flavors, something stuck me. Most of the arguments theists use to justify why *their* god(s) exist(s) and matches the description their religion makes of it can be applied equally well to gods the theist making the argument does not think exist. The theist making the argument has to apply different epistemic standards to their god than to the other gods in order to believe in one but not the others. As an outsider looking in, that smacks of either hypocrisy or ignorance and ruins the credibility of the argument, and therefore of the religion. If one religion is right, it should have *better* evidence than the wrong ones.&#x200B;Note that I am not necessary the most knowledgeable scholar of religions, so don't hesitate to point out the evidence for your religion that is epistemically similar or better than the one presented for other religions in top comments.Edit : well, that engaged people for longer than i thought it would and i have a pretty early and important day ahead of me tomorrow. Thanks for all the feedback, but it is unlikely that i'll engage any more here for the time being.","This is a false dilemma. There is no ""better"" set of arguments or evidence, as each religion has its own set of beliefs that may be epistemically justified.

I don't think they want me defending this position, so I will stop aggravating them by ending my replies. Thanks for all the great feedback!!!  :)&#x200B;For many people who cannot afford to have children--or simply don't want to have children--it has become too risky to have sex in states where abortion and day after pills have been banned. Some may take the risk, of course, but for many others, such as myself, I can't imagine having sex when it could totally ruin my life (as well as the life of potential partners and future children).Although I am middle class and middle aged, there is no way that I can afford children---and I've never wanted children. So I simply can't imagine sex being a viable option in my life.It could be said that contraception is still available, but it's not 100%. Why take the risk when having children would mean raising them in a world where their parents can't afford to feed them and don't even want them?Another objection might be that technically there is no ban. True! But that's why I said ""effectively banned."" The phrasing is intended to convey the point that the negative consequences have been raised so high---either go to jail or ruin your life with children you can't afford--it's simply unrealistic in actual practice for many of us to have sex as a viable option in life.CMV!!  :)&#x200B;EDIT: Condoms are only 98% effective. Someone in their 20s or 30s having sex a couple hundred times a year really is taking a risk with life consequences.

And many poor people cannot afford or have insurance for a vasectomy.EDIT 2 on Deltas: I've awarded 2 deltas so far on insurance covering vasectomies and day after bills still being legal. Great job!

"26","cmv: ""anti-woke"" just means selectively preventing freedom of choice and diversity.","The governor of my state is proposing to abolish many diversity related courses and safe spaces for students in public universities, such as the one I'm attending. This includes courses about Jewish or African Americans, gender studies, and centers for African American, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Latino, or LGBTQ+ students. The language in the bill also suggests that black sororities and fraternities would be banned from campuses. None of the things that the governor's bill is targeting are mandatory for university students to take part in or complete for graduation. They are simply options for students who are interested in them, which happens to be a lot of underrepresented students, myself included.His goal is to target and diminish ""woke-ness"", especially in education.I attend a predominantly white university and in recent months, centers for black students have been vandalized with racist graffiti messages MULTIPLE TIMES and anti-semitic messages have been publicly displayed by conservative student clubs. There is a lot of animosity between conservative student orgs. and religious/cultural orgs. like the Hillel Org. at my school. As someone who is ethnically black and Jewish, I already feel unsafe at my university but the possibility of the bill mentioned above being passed (which is highly likely) just makes me feel like transferring to a university in a less red state even though I have a full tuition and housing ride at this school.I'm sharing very specific examples here but the point is, I find self-declared anti-woke people like my governor to be disgustingly unpatriotic. It's one thing to not hold the same beliefs as somebody else but stripping away peoples' rights to safely explore their own beliefs/interests/identities with other like-minded individuals infringes on freedom of speech and expression. I'm saying this as someone who is not even super liberal or woke myself. I don't agree with everything that's deemed woke but I do believe it's dangerous to bar people's freedoms when they pose no physical threat to society.I am open to different views and possibly having my mind changed on this topic. I am not interested in ""what-about-ism"" on woke people, just a direct discussion on anti-woke people and whether or not their intentions are hypocritical.edit: 12 hr mark. i'll wait a few more hours to see if someone presents a view that changes my mind significantly. otherwise post will be deleted if i find it useless. but i have enjoyed hearing your opinions.

"27","CMV: I am very empathetic towards people who believe that abortion is murder & want to kill abortion doctors for murder.",">**Disclaimer:** I do not condone ***any*** type of violence against abortion doctors. I am a firm supporter of abortion for reasons I will not go into in this OP as to not derail the comment sections. If you are pro-abortion and want to enact change, violence is one of the worst things you could probably do it.There are many reasons as to why abortions are seen as immoral by some. One very popular one is that either embryos or fetuses have reached a stage in life that the same people interpret as a state **personhood** worth protecting. Most states in the United States consider the murder of a pregnant woman to be ***double*** **homicide,** lining up with the type of state of mind that I'm trying to highlight.Take, for example, **Nazi Germany** when they were genociding jews and other minorities that they deemed undesirable. ~~I can't think of a single person that~~ Most people wouldn't disagree with killing people who were in charge of concentration camps, the guards, the Germans who were executing them.Racial hygiene and the disposal of undesirables wasn't seen as evil. Nazi Germany wasn't a bunch of villains twirling their evil mustaches trying to spread evil for the sake of evil. They were **convinced** that what they've been doing was good.Thus, while I think that anyone who murders an abortion doctor for handling abortions should be punished and convicted for murder, I do morally sympathize with their not-so-far-fetched view that these people were committing murder and deserve to be stopped.","I do not share this belief, and would instead advocate for people to have access to reproductive healthcare, which can include abortion.

"28","CMV: The EU should extend membership to North Africa and the Fertile Crescent if they can meet the necessary requirements to join","Basically what the title says. For most of history, “Europe” as a concept has been defined by the Roman Empire. Various states tried to claim themselves to be successors of it, and most states try to trace themselves back to it. The same is true of the states of the Levant, Mesopotamia, and North Africa. Yes, they are mostly Muslim, but besides that they’re far closer culturally to say Italy than they are to Pakistan or Indonesia or even a place like Saudi Arabia. They also have deep trade connections to the EU, and make up half of the Mediterranean’s coastline. Economic migrants from these regions also make up the backbone of many European economies, and it’s in Europe’s best interest to stabilize these countries and help them grow economically. With the exception of Egypt and Turkey, they also all have populations less than existing EU members, so they wouldn’t alter the balance of power that much. On the subject on immigration, the Sahara Desert is also a bunch more defensible border than the Mediterranean Sea, if you care about that. Culturally, many of these states once attempted to emulate European secularism, but failed, somewhat due to Europe closing them off and refusing cooperation or even harming them. I think opening those doors again and making it clear that the EU values these people would make democratic and secularizing reforms much more popular in the long run. I’m not saying that these countries should join tomorrow, far from it, just that they should be given that goal. States like Tunisia, Lebanon, and Israel would be a good place to start if expansion was considered (although again not at the current moment given their instability). I also think that encouraging cultural exchange through programs like EuroVision, NATO, and European sports leagues would be a good first step at improving relations. I think Europe as a cultural zone should end with the Zagros mountains, urals, Caspian Sea, Arabian desert, and Sahara desert, and I think as we move into a more globalized world, that will become clearer and clearer.","European Union membership should be extended to North Africa and the Fertile Crescent if the countries can meet the necessary requirements, including democratic governance, human rights, and a functioning market economy.The European Union has been a valuable ally to these countries as they have made strides in democracy, human rights, and economic development over the past several decades. These countries are now ready to join the EU and benefit from its membership benefits, such as access to a shared market and support for economic growth."

A few years ago, while working at a warehouse, I met my first trans individual. We were the only two people within 20+ feet of anyone else, constantly working together 5 days a week/8 hrs a day. Due to this, we developed a good friendship, added him on social media, and it was kinda my 'woah-this-is-just-another-person' moment, due to the fact we shared a lot of the same interests. The thing is, they never told me, or as far as I know, anyone else they were trans. They were just a man. And that is what everyone considered him to be, even if some small features still retained from their previous gender. They don't have it on social media, either.Fast forward a few years later, I have a very open-minded (and patient lol) girlfriend and she happens to be best friends with a person who is trans. They're a good person to be around, very funny and laid back. However, they are very loud about the fact that they are trans. she has it on their social media, she brings it up in casual conversation.Now, of course it shouldn't matter how anyone label themselves. However, what has been explained to me through my own research, accounts of trans individuals on socials like Reddit, and my girlfriend is that (correct me if I'm wrong): They felt out of their body as their assigned gender, and having to act in accordance with the gender roles they were assigned to was torturous. So it is either transitioning, or living life like they are lying to themselves. Which I 100% get and empathize with.What I don't get is, if it was so torturous to live life as that gender why would you advertise you used to be it and now aren't? Why not just be firm in your stance ""I am a man."" ""I am a woman.""? It feels like attention-seeking behavior to me, and somewhat akin to me saying ""Hi yes, my name is X and I have a penis. What's up?"". Whenever I hear the words or see someone label someone themselves as transgender, I can't help to feel weirded out by the fact they are even saying it.  So, I am hoping maybe if I understand it more, I can get rid of that feeling. There must be something I am missing for something so glaringly obvious.&#x200B;Edit: Thanks for the responses, I won't be answering to anymore though. My view has been changed.",""
"31","CMV: I don’t think there is anything that is not okay to joke about.","I recently had a debate with someone who thought that certain things are not okay to laugh at and I completely disagree.I think EVERYTHING can be funny if the joke it told the proper way. I would even say I’ve probably heard/seen something funny about every serious, sad, horrific and distressing subject matter.There is one main prerequisite that needs to be met for everything to be okay to joke about. * Time & place: I don’t think unsolicited jokes will be received well and that’s understandable. In passing, on the street, at work, at school or even among friends. If someone comes to a show or chooses to watch/listen to media with jokes, I think that those are the few places where *everything* is okay to joke about. Telling a sexist joke to someone while they are looking for their brand of bread at the store is not the time. So given the proper time and place, I think everything has the green light. I am not saying just because a joke takes places in a situation that is proper will make the joke funny by the way. I’m not saying no one will be offended, doesn’t make it less funny for some either. There is nuance, there is talent when it comes to jokes. Not everyone can write and or perform them as well as others.So let’s see if you can come up with something that I have not found humorous. Give me a topic. If I’ve never heard something humorous about it, we can discuss why it isn’t okay.","JB: Absolutely. I think that it’s important to have a sense of humor and to be able to joke around. I think that it can be a very positive thing to have a good sense of humor."
"32","CMV: I think the only reason there isn’t as much blow back from men portraying/acting like women is because of transgenderism","When it comes to actors portraying someone that doesn’t match their actual weight or ethnicity, there has been some issues. Simpsons, Family Guy & Big Mouth all had white actors who played non white characters and it was a “problem” and they switched it up.Tyler Perry, [Brendan Fraser](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/brendan-fraser-oscars-2023-fatphobic-49114114/amp), Martin Lawrence, Eddie Murphy & Robin Williams have caught flack for wearing fat suits. When it comes to white actors playing non white characters, there is a racist history in the US behind that. Some shows were performed that highlights stereotypes.There is a sexist past in different cultures (Greek and Japanese for example) when it comes to women on stage. They simply were not allowed. No equality there. No opportunities for the same position. So if a racist past is enough to stop a white actor from playing a black character, why not a male playing a female?On Fox when it comes to two shows that had an issue with a white person playing a non white character, they have another show where men play 3/4 characters. Big Mouth as well has a man playing a female character. Why is that not an issue?I think because some men like to dress as women and or like to perform drag, not much is said about those occurrences. Drag shows seem pretty similar to minstrel shows to me. Non women highlighting/exaggerating stereotypical female behavior. So what other reason is there for there to be more of an issue when it comes to weight and ethnicity vs sex?",". Transgenderism allows men to portray and act like women without being criticized. If men were allowed to portray and act like women without being transgender, there would be a lot more backlash."
"33","CMV: Our economic system cares about maximum profits only , there are byproducts such as declining mental health, social/cultural isolation which are still not being taken seriously enough due to this willful ignorance","If our economic system cared about people, why does it let the homeless die, it seems people are getting poor again in the last few years, inflation's up again, you know the drill. But how far will inflation and other systems go to keep you poor? Bet on it. Will capitalism in 50 years look better or worse than today? I think worse. Everything seems to be going downhill, every generation that is coming after the next is fucked. FUBAR. There's no direction to this crazy train we're born on. It could go any number of ways but the trend is a downward spiral of traumatic mental health that either goes unnoticed and/or costs your entire salary to cure, which doesn't even cure it, just a cope. Therapy is what $300 a session? How many of these sessions of ""talking"" do I need before I'm cured? Oh 9999? Let's do some quick mafs $300x9999.. that's about enough money to fuck your credit score real good.You've got people able to land a man on the moon/ mars whatever, big whoop but you cannot even take care of your own species? Taking care of your species should be number 1 priority in evolution. Empathy exists for a reason, it makes animals group together, together strong apes.. apes together strong. Our bastardized version of ""crony capitalism"" is this terrible invention that has brought about such misery. Depths of mental strain that is inconceivable in any other point in history. At least if you were born in 1700 you could die quickly of disease. But today we live longer, and die on the inside, we die for decades at a time. Sitting in our fancy cars, gridlocked on the freeway, every single day. To go to work for a job we don't like and get paid barely enough to get by. Too much to think about, too much to manage and it all feeds into the human negativity bias. Less to think about is better.It's like we're all in one big pot and over the years the chefs have brought us to the boil and left us there, forgetting entirely about his priorities. We're burnt food now and now completely useless to the chef, food to be thrown away. Destroy the profit-seeking fake-capitalism and make a new one. Try harder,  greedy apes.&#x200B;Edit a word or twoFinal Edit: 48+ hours, When I took a much needed break it was roughly 256 comments.

HAGO",".The economic system does care about profits, and also about human well-being (insofar as it is possible for economic activity to improve human well-being). However, it is often difficult to assess the extent to which particular outcomes (such as declining mental health or social isolation) are due to the workings of the economic system, rather than other factors. This willful ignorance is a major barrier to addressing these issues."
"34","CMV: People who refuse to get a job should not be able to continue drawing from social safety nets.","I’ll start off with saying that I don’t have any issue whatsoever with these programs existing. I happily pay a decent chunk of my paycheck knowing that these programs exist to help people who are down on their luck. And that could happen to any of us, me included one day. A lot of people are helped by programs like food stamps and government housing. But I’ve also seen a lot of people in my city who abuse the system and refuse to be anything other than a parasite. I’ve literally watched them lounge around while businesses are desperately trying to hire people. I don’t think it’s fair to the taxpayer that these people are continuously supported. I’d much rather those funds go to further help those who are in their situations unwillingly- those who will make an effort to actually better their situations. I feel like someone who refuses to contribute (and is able to do so) shouldn’t receive others’ contributions. I’ll admit that my own political bias has likely affected this belief, but I fail to see a good reason why blatant abuse of the system like this should be tolerated.Edit: Wanted to thank the dozens of contributions here. There are, admittedly, a lot more factors involved in this process than I’d initially thought.","This is a loaded question. I think that it's important to consider the reasons why someone might refuse to get a job. For some, it may be because they are unmotivated or lack the requisite skills. Others may be unable to find a job that matches their level of experience or salary requirements. This last group may be eligible for social safety net assistance, but if they do not want or are unable to take advantage of such benefits, they should not be faulted for that."
"35","CMV: Fighting serves no purpose in hockey anymore and should just be banned.","I grew up watching and enjoying fighting in ice hockey, but over the years I've come to find it to be a bit of a sideshow. Hockey is a sport that rewards speed, coordination, reaction time, and physicality. The idea that you're just going to stop that game every now and then for a bareknuckle boxing match -when you really think about it- is kind of absurd. The typical argument you hear in favour of fighting is that it serves as a form of ""self-policing"" among players. Outside of a few anecdotes, I'm not sure this is supported by any data. Leagues where fighting isn't permitted don't have a higher incidence of violent, illegal hits. In my experience, it's leagues where fighting is more pronounced that have a tendency to be more goon-ish in general. Just look at the old NHL. I don't think anyone would suggest that since the NHL made fighting more rare, the league has become more violent or dangerous. Quite the opposite, it's proved that a different approach to officiating can ensure player safety without fighting. If anything, it's clear that fighting is more of a hazard to player safety than anything. How many guys end up with serious health issues stemming from that repeated head trauma, to say nothing of those who have actually been killed on the ice?It creates a race to the bottom, where teams feel they need to have players on the ice whose value is derived from being obscenely physical. Since the opposing team has one of those players, you need one too, and so on. Then there's a critical mass of players on either team who can't really contribute beyond their ability to potentially hurt other players. It's just an arms race. I think the real argument for fighting is that some fans enjoy watching it. It's not about player safety. It's not about the 'code.' But if you want to watch a fight, watch MMA. The NHL's rule changes that have greatly restricted fighting have also allowed it to become a more graceful, skillful game. I'd rather see the Cale Makars and Connor McDavids of the world do what they do then see a few guys who can barely skate rearrange each other's faces a couple times a game.","There is no one definitive answer to this question. Some people might argue that fighting does serve a purpose in hockey, providing a physical and emotional outlet for players who might be frustrated or upset on the ice. Others might suggest that, with the decreased number of fights, hockey has lost its appeal and is no longer enjoyable to watch. Ultimately, it is up to the NHL and its various governing bodies to make the decision as to whether or not fighting should be banned from the sport."
"36","CMV: Movie critics should stop reviewing MCU movies","Ok now this isn't necessarily a fully-formed opinion, but I think there's something here so please hear me out and help me poke some holes in it.Many critics of the latest few Marvel/MCU movies (e.g. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Thor: Love and Thunder) have left reviews along the lines of ""there are too many Marvel movies, the tropes are tired and the beats are predictable"". Is this a valid opinion to have? Yes, of course. ...Is this a useful criticism of the 35th installation in a superhero movie franchise? I would say no.My opinion is that MCU movies reached a point (probably after the Infinity War saga*) of being nerdy enough that the only people in the public still watching them, are people that have watched all/most of them, enjoy the superhero trope, and appreciate the weird universe-expanding format.At this point it's like a comic franchise... imagine if critics reviewed each new Marvel comic by saying ""there are too many superhero comics, the tropes are tired"". That's not a fair criticism of a Marvel comic, so should it be of a Marvel movie?The critics' Rotten Tomatoes score of Quantumania is 47, and the audience's score is 83. This to me perfectly illustrates that the consumers of Marvel movies are generally much more bought into the format, than the average critic. People who are sick of superhero movies are no longer watching these movies, and will not go see the next movie depending on critics' opinions.  So to round up my opinion, I think that most critics should stop reviewing most MCU movies. Maybe some stand on their own as fun stories and can be watched in isolation, but the more world building weirdness there is, the worse this will get, and at one point critic reviews will be completely useless."," 5We should stop reviewing MCU movies because they're just not as good as the Marvel comics."
"37","CMV: Debating about ""robots rights"" outside the realm of science fiction is ridiculous","I love robot stories. I think it's really interesting to think about how robots would be integrated in our society, from the most basic ones to complex IAs that could perfectly mimic human behaviour. It's an interesting thought-experiment that can also serve really well as social commentary.But that's what it is for me: fiction. I can't take the idea of robots having rights seriously. A robot, no matter how advanced, complex and human like, would be nothing more than a home appliance. It would be a human creation, just like cars, not a human, not an animal, they wouldn't even be sentient, just lines of codes mimicking human behaviour and thinking, depending solely on our tendency to anthropomorphize non-human things. Giving robots rights is no different than giving an intelligent fridge rights.I often see discussions about robots popping up here and there, with some fervent defendants that they should have rights as long as they reach the point where they ""act just like humans"" (which is a problematic view for whole other reasons, like ""what does acting like humans mean? So less intelligent robots that couldn't pass as humans wouldn't have rights? Why not?""), but for me a robot with human like intelligence still holds less value than a fly (of course, I'm talking about the ""value of life"" here, not monetary or personal importance).","This is a defective sentence."
"38","CMV: there is no argument that sufficiently overrides a students rights explaining why a student(in the USA) must recite the pledge of allegiance.","im going to start by addressing some of the primary arguments for it1. its to honor people who died for you/ your country.the students in no way likely compelled or asked said people(soldiers) to die or fight in a war. additionally most wars in modern history fought by the us have not been fought for the sovereignty or preservation of the USA as a country but rather for political gain and posturing. compounding this the student in question(assuming they are a k-11) has no ability to directly change political policy or if a war is fought or not. lastly the person in question could have easily have been born anywhere else and did not willingly decide to be born in a specific country or location.2. its respectfulit is inherently disrespectful to mandate that a student say any set of words or phrases against their will especially if they are of a different religion and do not agree with the under god part of the pledge of allegiance. to further back this claim the pledge of allegiance is allegedly a symbol of american values/policies like ""freedom and the constitution, given that the constitution contains the first amendment its disrespectful and mocking to the student to utilize such a symbol as a method of depriving said student of the rights said symbol represents.lastly punishing students for not reciting it is essentially punishing a thought crime.","There is no justification that would override a student's rights under the United States Constitution."
"39","CMV: Economic systems have negative impact on society... but that's not really their problem.","I've been reading a lot of CMV complaining about how Capitalism has a negative impact on society. Things like a decrease in general mental health, an abused work force and etc. And I agree with all of it!The thing I'm on the fence about is ... I don't really see how that's something we can blame on our chosen economic system since... well it was never it's goal in the first place.Isn't an economics system sole goal to dictate how goods are produced and distributed and attempt to maximize the output? All the economics system I know of have some variance on how this is achieved, but the goal remains the same. The mission statement isn't ""Make everyone happy"" it's ""Make as much product/money as possible"". So that's really the only reasonable criteria upon which  we can criticize capitalism - ""Does it maximize production?""It doesn't seem reasonable to blame a fruit tree for making a shitty tasting fruit... well yeah, it's goal was never to feed you in the first place... it's goal was to spread it's seed. Can't fault it for making a fruit not edible to humans.TLDR My POV is : you can't blame XYZ economic system for being shitty based on societal issues, it wasn't designed to handle those issues. You can't blame Capitalism for being shitty to people, if it's goal was never to \*not\* be shitty to people.","There is a commonly held misconception, which is sometimes referred to as the ""Crisis Theory,"" that economic systems inherently generate negative effects on society. In fact, the problem is not so much with the economic systems themselves, but with the way in which they are implemented and managed.When economic systems are designed and implemented in a way that benefits the few at the expense of the many, it inevitably leads to social unrest and inequality. This is because the majority of people are left with little or no recourse when economic systems fail to provide them with the prosperity and security that they need and deserve.3) CMV: If a society has a negative economic system, it will eventually collapse.While it is certainly possible for a society with a negative economic system to collapse, this is not always the case. In some cases, a society may undergo a gradual deterioration that eventually leads to the system's failure. Alternatively, a society may find a way to adjust and adapt to its economic conditions, even if it is not in the best interest of the majority of its citizens.Ultimately, it is up to the citizens of a negative economic system to make sure that they are vocal and active in their efforts to improve it. If they are unwilling or unable to do this, then the system is likely to buck and fail."

"41","CMV: I consider Christians to be frauds if they haven't read through the Bible at least once throughout their life.","I've recently started reading the Bible (usually to fall asleep at night) and have made it halfway through Genesis. Whenever I converse with Christians, it seems that many Christians have not delved deep into their religious text beyond simply reading scripture during Bible study. I am an agnostic, so I'm still exploring my own beliefs, but even if I were to believe in God, I don't think it would necessarily align with the Christian conception of a deity. Another reason I am reading through the bible is that many video games and media entertainment have religious references. For example, Assassin Creed: Odyssey and the God of War series made me more interested in studying Greek Mythology. I started to study Christian Mythology and have encountered interesting stories like Paradise Lost and the Tower of Babel, which had created a lot of insightful discussion with experienced Christians.The Bible contains material that is fundamental to Christian belief, and it's generally considered important for Christians to read the Bible at least once in their lifetime. Many would argue that it's a crucial aspect of their faith. I estimate the Bible to be the length of about two Harry Potter novels, and many people in the world have read the Harry Potter series. Anyways, if they truly have faith in a deity, then why wouldn't they invest the time on learning about such deity? It doesn't make sense to me.","No, I don't consider Christians to be frauds if they haven't read through the Bible at least once throughout their life."
"42","CMV: AIs are not going to destroy industries as much as people think","I’m a travel agent of 20+ years and ever since Chatgpd went viral I’ve gotten more and more people (including my 21-year-old son) telling me that both my job and the whole travel agent industry will be made obsolete by AIs currently available like [Stravl](https://www.stravl.com) & [Chatgpd](https://chat.openai.com)I disagree. Sure, AI might be able to do some basic stuff & sound very convincing at it, but even with seemingly simple stuff (like planning a trip), it’s missing the distinctly human touch. For instance, it can find popular destinations and list information about them, but will it ever truly understand the nuances of what a human being wants to experience through travel?A large part of my job is talking to customers, asking them about themselves, & getting a feel for their travel preferences. There is so much human connection that goes into planning the perfect trip for them. I don’t think AIs will know what to ask people. I don’t think they can have that “human connection” with travelers. There’s just something about sitting across from a real human, who you know you can trust to make your trip extra special, that makes this process so much more enjoyable for travelers.I have tried some of the “Virtual Travel Agents” online & they seemed to have proven my points. Talking to a chatbot just seems awkward, untrustworthy, & fake. Maybe I’m just getting old, but is there not something special about having a human on your side that can step in if something goes wrong, that can listen to you, & personalize your vacation?Is it true that people don’t care about that “human touch” anymore? Is there something I’m not getting about AIs?&#x200B;**Edit(s):**Cuz ppl asked, **these are the sites I am referring to** (copied from comment)\---------------------I tried a couple of AIs that claim to be ""the future of travel:* Stravl ([www.stravl.com](https://www.stravl.com/))* OpenAI or Chatgpd ([chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/))* and a couple more (will edit in)They seem fun to use, but not serious travel planners. More like something cool to try out and show a friend, but not something that will actually plan my trip imo.\---------------------Also, I agree that AIs will become better, but **mainly question their ability to gain people's trust compared to a travel agent**","There is a lot of talk about how AIs will destroy industries and how we need to prepare for that. However, this isn't necessarily true.First of all, AIs will replace certain jobs, but this won't necessarily mean that all industries will go away. Instead, new industries will be created that focus on using AI and other technologies to help make businesses more efficient.Second, AIs will not be able to create products that are completely unique. Instead, they will be able to copy or imitate products that are already popular. This means that some industries will be less affected than others, but overall the economy will continue to grow.Bottom line: There is a lot of fear around the rise of AIs, but it is not necessarily going to destroy the economy. Instead, it will create new industries that focus on using technology to improve efficiency and make products more unique."
"43","CMV: we should not be blaming Tems for obscuring people's views at the Oscars with her dress.","Social media was crazy this morning blaming Tems for her huge dress which may have blocked the views of people behind her. And people are being really aggressive about it on Reddit and Twitter. This aggression, in my opinion, is unfounded. What's more, I think it is premature to blame her at all. Here's my reasoning:1) If she was given the design beforehand, there is no reason to assume that she knew better. This is her first year being well known, whereas previously she was an unknown musician from Africa. I don't know anyone who has ever worn a dress that has a collar higher than their head. It's not exactly a common thing. So would the average person be able to immediately see from a design that that would be obstructing someone's view? Hard to say. Especially if you are not used to wearing performative pieces and going to events like that. If you were exceptionally tall, or usually wear hats, then maybe you would think of it. But as it stands, I have yet to be convinced that the average person would anticipate this.2) Once she got the dress, if she noticed it was too large, that would have been too late. For the most part, actresses do not wear dresses that they own to the Oscars. They sign a contract with a designer to showcase a dress. Often these dresses cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to make. So at that point she couldn't have just not worn it and could even have been sued for doing so. 3) Lastly, some people have commented online that Tems should have pushed the dress down or changed seats. You don't know if either of those were actual options. Changing seats probably would have been impossible for an event like that, and pushing the dress down could have damaged it. Plus, it's not even clear that the people behind her even _mentioned_ to her that they could not see. That is just pure speculation at this point","There is no denying that Tems' dress at the Academy Awards overshadowed a number of other nominees and attendees. However, it is also important to not place all the blame on her. Tems' dress was one element of a much larger and complex event. There were a number of factors that contributed to what transpired on Oscar night, and it is unfair to single out Tems for her dress when other players, such as the designers who created the gowns, the producers who green-lit the film, and the actors and actresses who starred in the nominated films, also had a role to play."
"44","CMV: There is nothing wrong with video games having an easy mode or people wanting one.","Edit: I now understand why for certain games a difficulty mode might not be useful or could undermine the theme. Feel free to still comment just know that I’ve already changed my view significantly. —I always been perplexed when people get upset at the addition of (or someone saying they’d want an addition of) an easy mode to games that they enjoy.I’m someone who enjoys modes and will use a variety of modes depending on the mood I’m in/ how much time I have. If it’s a genre I’m familiar with and I feel like I challenge I would choose “hard.” If I’m not as into the gameplay for a game and just want to enjoy the story I’d have no problem choosing “easy.” For times where I’m feeling somewhere in-between I’ll choose “normal.”I really enjoy the flexibility of different difficulty modes in video games but see pushback against difficulty modes a lot so I wanted to hear other perspectives.I understand that some people always want a challenge, but I’m not sure how it affects their gameplay to simply choose “hard” and let others do as they wish. Different modes and more decisions with how gameplay works also helps people with disabilities that might make video games more challenging. All and all I’d like to understand the criticism and know if there’s something I’m overlooking.","There can be nothing wrong with having an easy mode, as long as it is not forced upon players or given as an ""achievement.""

"45","CMV: Most feminist groups only care about men's problems if they affect women","Tl;dr: Mainstream groups that aim for gender equality are useless at addressing issues that mostly affect men because they only really care about women.Usually when people bring up areas where men are worse off than women (e.g. college enrollment rates, suicide, homelessness, loneliness) and say that efforts should be made to address them, the response is that gender based issues already have a solution which is feminist groups. I'd argue that feminist groups shouldn't be left to solve them.It seems to me that **most** feminist groups only care about men's issues if they affect women. Recently I saw [this article linked](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/) and it describes how men are increasingly likely to be lonely. The article argues that this is a problem because it affects women who are stuck dealing with the men in their lives who are otherwise isolated. That these men are miserable is an afterthought.Similarly, boys who start to be exposed to Andrew Tate are seen as problems because of how they might behave later in life with women. Incels are problems because they might hurt women but the fact that they're lonely and miserable is ignored. Usually when feminist writers bring up the way women are a majority of college students, it leads to complaints that these women find dating harder and that they're more likely to struggle with student debt.It seems that if men would only be miserable, lonely and suicidal on their own and avoid women, these groups would be perfectly happy so I don't trust them to care about these problems beyond trying to further isolate the men affected.**EDIT: For all the people saying ""this is like asking the NAACP to care about anti-semitism"", I'd argue feminism portrays itself as fighting sexism and gender inequality, not a group for one demographic like the NAACP.**"," specificallyFalse."

Although someone who can paint a picture manually tends to still be, to me, more impressive (when it comes to their skill) than a photographer who managed to take an outstanding picture.See that previous paragraph? I believe AI artists work the same way. It's not easy to make AI art -- I've tried to do it and by god, is it tough. You need to choose the right words, find the right prompts, pick the right seed -- sometimes even different AIs (compare a different AI with a different camera) because NovelAI is good at a specific thing while, say, character dot ai is good at another -- and then you have to comb through several pictures. Like with being a photographer, it takes effort and it IS fascinating to see what people can do, \*even\* if manual pictures are still more impressive. ...Just like fabric, too! I love me some industrial clothings, but if my mom makes something I can buy on the store with her own hands? Holy smokes.I don't think people losing their jobs for AI is an actual bad thing at a societal level; sure, it sucks for them and it'd suck for me if I were one of those people, but it's necessary (perhaps even healthy? God, imagine having to pick cotton all day in the sun -- thank goodness for tractors). I'm not losing my job yet as a programmer but I eventually will, just like cars did to horses, and that's alright. Humans need not apply.","true"
"47","cmv: neoclassical economics should be discarded as a field","Neoclassical economics (econ) purports to describe how people make decisions around allocation of resources. But in both lab and real world settings it has been proven that it does not. It is therefore a broken field of inquiry, pseudo science, and should cease to be taught or researched. In the lab:- copious behavioural research has demonstrated that people do not think or make decisions the way econ thinks they should. Moreover people do not behave 'as if' they were econs - the outcomes of their decisions are different.In reality: - in my own field of environmental and climate economics, neoclassical assumptions have been profoundly damaging. They consistently suggest absurd decarbonisation pathways that rely on rates of land use change 3x faster than any observed in history. Such transitions are not only implausible, they are highly undesirable. The rapid pace of soybean uptake, e.g., has led led widespread spillover deforestation in the amazon. Econ denies such problems by assuming perfect policy oversight and an absence of counterproductive decisions. - more absurdly still, econ suggests 4degrees of warming is compatible with a growing economy, and indeed is the optimal tradeoff between costs of decarbonisation and climate damages. 4degrees of warming is borderline incompatible present day human societies. Therefore, neoclassical economics is not only false, but profoundly damaging, making absurd and unworkable policy recommendations in important areas of work.It should no longer be taught or researched.","I don't agree with this. While neoclassical economics may not be perfect, it has a lot of good ideas."

"50","CMV: STAR voting is superior to Instant Runoff Voting aka Ranked Choice.","STAR voting is a voting system where you give as many candidates as you want a 0-5 rating.  Then,  there's a stimulated runoff between the two candidates with the highest average ratings.  The candidate who is higher ranked on more ballots is the winner.For example, if you give Alice a rating of 5 and Bob a rating of 4, you count as a vote for Alice in a runoff between Alice and Bob.   If you gave them both a 5, you'd count as an obstention.This is a useful deterrent to certain kinds of strategic voting.  For example, suppose you're voting in a presidential election, and you're trying to maximize the chance of Bernie Sanders winning.  Naively, the way to do that is to give Bernie Sanders a 5 and everyone else a 0.  However,  the problem with that is if the runoff is actually between Elizabeth Warren and Trump, you've abstained even though you presumably prefer Warren to Trump.  Likewise if the runoff is between Warren and Biden,  Biden and Kasich or Kasich and Trump.  If you want your vote to count in the runoff, voting honestly is a far superior strategy than bullet voting. Instant runoff voting is a voting system where voters list their first, second, third, etc choices.  Then, if there's not a candidate with an absolute majority of the remaining votes, you eliminate the candidate with the lowest vote total and reallocate the votes to their next *remaining* preference.In IRV, your second place selection gets no support from you until your first place is eliminated, assuming your second place wasn't eliminated first.  This means that compromise candidates with a lot of second place support could easily be eliminated early, and that election order is very important.Instant runoff has some really weird edge cases because elimination order is very important to the results.  For example, in the 2009 Burlington mayoral election, the Progressive candidate won.   However, Republicans could have caused the Progressive candidate to lose by having the right number of Republicans put the Progressive as their top choice, or by staying home.IRV makes it so that voting for additional candidates can't hurt your favorite, but at the cost of making it riskier to support your favorite. [Ka Ping Yee has an interesting voting system visualizion, coloring in a 2d political compass by the color of the candidate who would win if the center of public opinion is within that area.](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/)  Most systems produce sensible diagrams, but IRV produces the oddest looking diagrams, with shapes that make no sense.  STAR isn't on there, but it shouldn't look too much different from approval. [An important way to look at voting systems is 'Voter Satisfaction Efficiency'](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic), a measure of how happy people are with the results.  IRV is slightly better than plurality, but significantly worse than approval voting, STAR or 3-2-1.There's no such thing as a perfect voting system, but IRV makes a worse set of tradeoffs than STAR.","Assuming that all voters evaluate the same candidates in the same way, then yes, STAR voting is superior to Instant Runoff Voting. STAR voting preserves the order of candidates, so voters can more easily compare candidates and make informed decisions. Additionally, STAR voting allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, which helps to eliminate vote splitting and encourage voters to cast a vote for their favorite candidate."
"51","CMV: The #1 long term goal of humanity should be to expand sustainably","I think that the title of this post should be a **universal truth**. Please let me know why it shouldn't be.1. I assume that collectively, humanity as a species wishes to survive.2. Humanity can be likened to a parasite and our host is Earth\*3. It presently appears that our parasitic nature may cause ecological collapse that would in turn destroy ourselves.4. The only way we might survive this is to either: (a) build successful colonies off-planet; or (b) find ways to live sustainably on Earth, i.e. live in symbiosis with our host.5. Even if we achieve 4(a), failing to achieve 4(b) will mean that we will need to continuously jump planets.6. Thus, preferably we achieve 4(b) so that 4(a) is optional... barring non-human threats like the Sun burning out.7. Assuming 1-6 is true, we all really need to wake up to do whatever we can within our individual power to make 4(b) possible.8. Ideally 4(b) can be done with kindness and inclusion. Eg. EV cars made from forced labour cobalt mines are not ideal.Notes:* This is about humanity's #1 long term goal, not Country X, or John Doe individually. I'm sure the top goal of a starving person is to eat, not question whether the food is from sustainable sources.* This is a bloody idealistic post. I have no answers on how we may achieve it, and  I acknowledge that tradeoffs may need to happen against other goals of humanity. But I stand firm that this should be our **#1 long term goal.*** I include the words 'long term' as I recognize short term crises may arise (eg. covid) that steal attention from the long term. I feel though that short term crises never end. Like whack-a-mole, one will always pop-up after the other, so we really need to be managing short term crises **while simultaneously** progressing towards our #1 long term goal.* I have assumed that humanity deserves to exist and even expand, the validity of this could be discussed in a separate topic in itself.* I have made assumptions that things more or less stay the same until we achieve that goal. However, who knows, something more pressing to human survival may crop up in between, like a giant asteroid, or Skynet.* \*Sorry for the negative connotation of the word 'parasite'. I mean it in a most neutral way. I don't think it's morally wrong.

"52","CMV: Ariel 2023 Having Racial Diversity Is Good.","Edit: u/Phage0070 did a good job. I'm convinced that this movie may be evil. A great point some users picked up on was this:1. POC of girl is subservient to a white patriarch. White abusive love interests who she changes herself to appeal to rather than love herself. Her mother is gone and her father is a hispanic white passing male. This all perpetuates the white male patriarchs. 2. Asian women as one of the main casts and other POC of women. But lack of black and Asian men. Asian men are typically invisible in American white media, but blatantly so in this movie. Black men are typically portrayed as funny tropes similar to Asian men but zero to be seen. Except Sebastian who is played by Daveed Diggs. 3. Potential male romance role is once again a white male. While black, asian, and other POC of males are shafted. No black Eric. This could reinforce white patriarchy and white male worshipping while POC males are shafted, either played as joke roles or not at allMovie is very concerning now. May have to really reconsider my position and view. Hopefully the movie doesn't perpetuate white male worshipping and white patriarch. Shame disney.[ORIGINAL POST]Working with children in a very diverse area. It's nice to see better representation for children of color. Ariel is a good step in the right direction, it's not about us old timers anymore, it's about the children. Think about it like this, while it's nice to see white men in there 30s heavily concerned about the race of a mermaids in a children's movie. Growing up, it's always this:White man saves the day, is the hero, is the main character. White female is the princess, the main character, sometimes hero, center of attention, is the main character. But we hardly see much positive representation of people of color, only recently changes have been made, but with a lot of push back. Black men? Often times portrayed as male thugs, gangsters, needing a white savior, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Black women portrayed loud and obnoxious.Asian men? Weak, feminine, thugs, or smart but expendable resources, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Asian women are made to hate the Asian men and worship a white man, while hating and denouncing Asian heritage and culture.These things propagate into our real world through in a sense manipulation and have extremely negative consequences. So I'm happy for this movement for better representation. Is it perfect? Nope. But I'm optimistic and think our kids will have a bettee time with more relateable and positive role models through the media.","CMV: Ariel 2023 Having Racial Diversity Is Good.There is no doubt that racial diversity is a valuable asset in any society. It provides a variety of perspectives and experiences that can enrich the lives of everyone in a community.In Ariel 2023, having a diverse population is considered a strength. This is because it provides opportunities for people of different backgrounds to come together and learn from each other. It also promotes social harmony and understanding, which is important in a society where differences are often seen as a source of conflict.There are plenty of benefits that can come from having a diverse population. It can help to improve the quality of life for everyone in a community. It can also promote creativity and innovation. In fact, research has shown that diversity is actually essential for the development of new ideas.Ultimately, it is important to remember that everyone is different and has their own unique perspective. Diversity is a valuable asset in any society, and in Ariel 2023, it is considered to be a strength."

"54","CMV: Teachers persistently wearing gag breasts should be promptly removed from in-class duties","Teachers persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding through their shirt should be promptly removed from in-class duties.Such behaviour is a form of sexual harassment of children who are not free to leave the person doing this, and who are not free to complain about the behaviour without a risk of reprisal from an individual in a position of authority.Working in a workshop while wearing gag breasts poses a risk of an accident which may injure the teacher or possibly someone else. While some may not care if the teacher injured themself, part of OHS is forbidding workers from working in an unsafe manner.Persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding is disrespectful to students and other teachers, and is disruptive to a school being a place of learning and personal development. It also promotes disrespect towards women when schools should promote respect for diverse groups of people. (If you’re female and you don’t feel offended, that’s fine, but that doesn’t mean others aren’t offended)If the teacher claims that the breasts are real, the teacher, possibly during paid work time and paid by the employer, should have a doctor certifying that the breasts are real.If the teacher is wearing gag breasts because of a mental issue which is not their fault, then they should be removed from in-class duties until their issue has resolved.If they can’t remove the teacher because of a teacher shortage or restrictions on disciplining teachers, fix the shortage or labour regulations.Schools should forbid inappropriate clothing for teachers and other staff, not just students.The school should not wait several months to act, or only act when international media gathered evidence that it was a charade. It should try to avoid punishing students for photographing the teacher - only doing so if it’s to prevent a lawsuit against the school or if the photography is disruptive or endorsing the teacher’s inappropriate behaviour.It should go without saying, but I’m using “they” because it’s about a hypothetical teacher who may be male or may be female, not because I’m asserting that the teacher is non-binary. And my view is about the school’s handling of the teacher, rather than about the teacher themself.Change my view.","We recommend that teachers persistently wearing gag breasts be promptly removed from in-class duties.

"55","CMV: there is no reason to assume animals can’t experience love like we can.","A question I keep asking myself is this: why do people act like every instance of animals showing affection can be explained away as different than ours?I’ve heard people say things like “dogs don’t really love you, they just love that you give them food.” And I guess I just don’t really understand because we could do the same with humans if we applied that logic consistently. “Oh, you don’t really love your family. You’re just conditioned to show them affection because they raised you and gave you food. You’re biologically wired to stick close to them because often times that would have given you a bigger chance for survival in the wild.”Why are people so determined to separate themselves from animals? Sure humans are different from a lot of other species in the world, but every species is unique. If the affection shown by animals isn’t indicative of love, then how can we say that the affection we feel and show is? I guess I should clarify I am not speaking about all animals here, but mostly about mammals who have an amygdala. If we’re willing to call our own biological feelings “love” then I don’t get why we can’t call that of animals the same.Edit: I’ve gotten some great responses here, thank you all. :) It’s true that I don’t think that all animals express their emotions in the same way that humans do. I guess I should clarify the reason that I think about this sort of thing is because I am concerned about animal cruelty and I have heard people justify hurting animals with the excuse that they don’t feel things like we do.Edit 2: I think I understand where the idea that animals experience emotions differently than us is coming from. Now I’m more curious about finding out exactly how animals experience the world. Thanks you all!","There is no reason to assume animals cannot experience love in the same way humans do. While there are fundamental differences in the way our brains function, it is possible that animals can feel love in a way that is similar to how humans do.There is significant evidence to suggest that many animals can experience love and affection. For example, studies have shown that animals can display behaviours that suggest they are in love, such as courtship, companionship, and sheltering. Additionally, some animals have been known to form strong attachments to one another, demonstrating characteristics such as trust and love.There is no clear answer as to why some animals seem to experience love more than others, but it is possible that the processes underlying love are similar in all organisms. Moreover, it is possible that love may play a major role in the communication and social interaction between animals. Therefore, it is important to continue research into the matter to better understand and appreciate the myriad ways in which animals can experience love."
"56","CMV: The people of the United States have the right to refer to their country as ""America"" if they want.","(Disclaimer: I'm not from the United States of America, but I'm also not Latin American either.)I'm a huge believer in self-determination on scales as small as the individual and as large as nations. I generally think that groups of people should be allowed to determine who they are and how they want to show themselves to the world. Of course, we can never control other people's perception, but we can self identify and try to shape that perception. In recent years I've seen a lot of people (mostly on the internet) arguing that referring to the US as ""America"" is a misnomer because ""America"" refers to a continent (or two continents, depending on your worldview). I think this argument often comes from people living in Latin America, but there could be others, I'm not certain. I've seen some people argue this from a linguistics standpoint, like calling the US ""America"" is a grammatical error, and I've seen others make an anti-imperialist case, arguing that Americans (or United Statesians, maybe) are trying to assert themselves as the masters of the Western Hemisphere.I think policing language is often (though certainly not always) unproductive. It seems to me like this is a case of outsiders (people not from the US) trying to police how people inside the US describe themselves. I think that Americans should be allowed to call themselves whatever they feel. Beyond this, I think the linguistic argument just doesn't work. Most North American english speakers don't think of ""America"" as being a word for a single continent, they think of ""North America"" and ""South America"" (or maybe ""The Americas"").**EDIT:**The original post above is unchanged for transparency's sake, but I want to make a few follow up points:* I use the word ""right"" pretty melodramatically here. I'm a melodramatic person. I don't think this is a life and death issue. I'm not advocating for this to be enshrined in law or whatever, and I thought the body of the post was decently clear on that.* A lot of people are pointing out that ""US"" instead of ""America"" reduces confusion when speaking with non-Americans/non-English speakers, and I 100% agree. But the core of my question assumes no ambiguity; it's about the fundamental nature of the name of the country and its people.","This is a matter of personal preference. Some people may feel more patriotic when referring to their country as ""America,"" while others may prefer to use another name.

Currently all they can do is speak. Freedom of speech and diversity of thought is one of the most important aspects of a functioning democracy. When people begin to physically assault others for their beliefs it is a sign of a movement towards authoritarianism.This is because violence towards people who have any differing opinions is only dependent on the common idea and can be turned in any direction if enough people agree. Ex. If I think that transgenderism is wrong and immoral and as dangerous as fascism and I have people that support me and we assault people who support transgenderism how are we any different than people who assault nazis?We’re not as it’s just about beliefs and if we decide to say it’s okay to assault people of x belief it opens up the door to assaulting people of any belief just because you disagree with them.

In some cases the social media companies are threatened with legal action over content created by everyday people. I believe that this is wrong.Social media companies are not media companies. They are a town square. They are a mall. They are the places that we all go to talk and share our ideas in perspectives. A Town square is not held accountable for people's inappropriate ideas or perspectives. Nor is a mall. A government has the responsibility of enforcing any restrictions on freedom of speech on its own citizens. I don't have a problem with them enforcing their rules on people but don't make a social media company do your police work .To me this seems like common sense. Obviously a lot of people disagree with me as well as a lot of governments. I would like to better understand another perspective.

In general, social media companies have a responsibility to provide a platform for free speech, despite the content that is posted on their sites. However, it is important to remember that social media companies are not the only sources of information available to users. The government also has a responsibility to monitor extremist content and to take appropriate action if it is found to be threatening or harmful. It is also important to remember that social media companies are not the only sources of inappropriate or harmful content. Some users may post content that is abusive or harmful in other ways, for example by inciting violence or hate crimes.

"60","CMV: Gary Lineker should publicly apologise or lose his role at the BBC","To give some background:- For those who don’t know, the BBC is the appointed national broadcaster, which role is to give British people impartial access to news.- Gary Lineker is an ex-England footballer and is currently a BBC Sport presenter- Gary Lineker has come out on Twitter actively criticising the government’s new Immigration policies on illegal immigrants (being denied asylum by default and permanently banned if they come to the UK illegally).- He went a bit far and compared the current policies to that of pre-war Nazi GermanyNow, I’m not saying I’m in support of the UK policies but I think it’s largely irrelevant. Taking a position with the BBC, employees are bound by that same impartiality. It’s a choice to work with the BBC, there are many other places Gary Lineker can choose to work and have public opinions…. but the impartiality of the BBC is brought (further) into question if it condones it’s employees actively opposing the government.I don’t think this is too far different from any employee causing instability for the company they’re working for. For example, let’s say I was known for working at company X advocating for legalising marijuana… that may reflect negatively upon the company and they would have a right to take reasonable actions. Like it or not, you’ve voluntarily entered a relationship with a company and are responsible for upholding their reputation or risking consequences. The main arguments I can see for a Gary Lineker are:- Freedom of Speech. I would argue he still has freedom of speech but, being paid as a celebrity, he doesn’t enjoy the same privacy and people know the organisations he represents. The BBC still have reasonable ground to take action against him and he’s still representing the BBC in some way, even if it’s just their hiring policy. - “The greater good”. He may be on the right side of a political debate and want to do good… but that’s what this is: A POLITICAL DEBATE which he’s precluded from engaging in as a BBC presenter. It also doesn’t mean he has complete immunity to the repercussions. That’s why people who take this stance are enshrined in history as they faced the consequences. - The BBC aren’t always impartial and have slipped up on a number of occasions. Although this is true, I don’t think there’s a lot of strength to say “well it’s not perfect. We may as well continue and sweep new instances under the rug”. If anything, I would argue this justifies an even stronger response to squash future claims.I wanted to hear others thoughts; maybe there’s another way around the issue or I’ve not considered an angle!

I had my mind changed on a few things and it was hella nice to discuss this without being targeted for -phobic when i dont understand or know something!&#x200B;One sidenote tho, If a women becomes a man. (transman) and likes girls. Wouldent that make them CIS men since Trans men are men?EDIT 2: my bad, had a wrong understanding of what CIS was, Assigned male and wants to be male= CIS, got it.

"62","CMV: Minorities should NOT be allowed to have institutions that only use their own language","Pretext: I am a Romanian citizen of Romanian-Hungarian descent and I live in Romania.I think it is detrimental to both minorities and the majority to allow minorities to have institutions that are exclusively or primarily using their native language.They should, however, be allowed to use it as a secondary language and to use it in any other private or public context.For a real life example, I will use public schools. Currently in Romania we have schools that explicitly teach only in Hungarian and we also have Hungarian sections in normal schools that only teach in Hungarian. I think they should be taught in Romanian, but they could have extra classes for Hungarian language, literature, history, etc. Reasons:1. Minority children that go to such schools often are completely or mostly illiterate in the majority language. Anecdotally, I can say that I know plenty of Hungarian kids(including relatives) that reach the age 18 without the ability to communicate in Romanian. This might mean that they fail their finals(which are at a national level, thus in Romanian) and that their opportunities are severely limited(in terms of education and employment)2. It contributes to cultural segregation and xenophobia. Again, this is anecdotal, but being part Hungarian myself and coming from a town with a high number of Hungarians, I've noticed Hungarians that are educated outside the Romanian system tend to be a lot more xenophobic and they also tend to be supporting separatist movements(they'd like the Ardeal region of Romania to join Hungary)Conclusion:Minorities should be forced to primarily use the majority language in public institutions in order to ensure they are integrated into society.Notes:1. I think they should be able and even encouraged to maintain their culture and language through other means. I don't have children yet, but when I do, I'd like for them to retain our Hungarian culture as well2. I've written this because I've heard plenty of Romanians complain and say that we shouldn't be helping Ukraine because they started forcing Romanians within Ukraine to have schools in Ukrainian, which they consider to be cultural genocide(I obviously disagree)Updates:1. I have decided that trying a softer approach by forcing Hungarian schools to at least teach their language and literature classes in Romanian primarily, rather than the whole curriculum, could be a better solution.","This is a false statement. Minorities should be allowed to have institutions that use their own language in order to preserve their culture and heritage."
"63","CMV: Humans are moral.","I know I've posted this before, but some people tended to stop responding quickly or just not providing reasoning. The mods can remove it if they want.&#x200B;So here it is:Just because we do something good and it makes us feel good doesn't mean it was selfish.a. That isn't necessarily WHY we did itb. It's not PLEASURE when we feel good in this case, it's aesthetic from the moral situation. Therefore, the DIRECT reason, at least, is that that is the moral state of the situation. Why you want that moral state? Fair, it could be selfish, but still, my point stands.&#x200B;Now, a common argument:Evolution: First of all, evolution can't think. It can't be selfish.

"64","CMV: It's possible to live a fulfilling adult life without having children","I think this is going to be one most people here won't want to answer. I spend a lot of time on the Internet in places where people hold views antithetical to what I typically see on Reddit. The resounding sentiment in these places is that people who don't have children past a certain point will end up frustrated, lonely, and unfulfilled. When I see this view being espoused it makes me a bit angry because I never really wanted kids, and I've been brought up to believe a person can find satisfaction in life through personal achievements.I’ve checked elsewhere online to find accounts of people who regret having children. Parents said they missed career opportunities, lost all their free time, took on tons of stress. But I found a recurring theme in these stories – that the parents loved their kids more than anything and wouldn’t trade them for the world. That doesn’t really sound like regret to me.One thing I don't think I can change my view on is that some people just aren't suited to have kids. But do those people deserve to be unfulfilled, then? For those of you who do believe having children is crucial, what is your solution to this?","There is no one right answer to this question since everyone's life is unique and what works for one person may not work for another. However, it's possible to have a fulfilling adult life without having children, provided that you're comfortable with that decision and have the financial resources to support yourself and a partner without children. It's also important to note that there are many benefits to raising children, including the opportunity to create a legacy for future generations and the satisfaction of watching children grow and develop into adults. Whatever decision you make, it's important to weigh all of the pros and cons carefully before making a decision."
"65","CMV: Peter Singer was right in Famine, Affluence and morality","A genuine change my view. I just don’t see any flaws in Singer’s argument to be honest and it basically means we’re all terrible people.For those not familiar I’ll give my paraphrased version of the argument1. If we can prevent something very bad from happening without sacrificing anything of moral significance we are obliged to do it. His example is, you see a child drowning and you can save him but it will ruin your clothes. The cost of your clothing would not be of moral significance so you are morally (not legally) obligated to jump in and save the child. We would probably view someone who didn’t as a bad person.2. Famine, preventable illness, death etc. are very bad things3. Organizations like unicef, against malaria foundation etc prevent the suffering described in premise 24. The luxury goods we buy on a daily basis are not of moral significance. I don’t need a cup of coffee in the morning, or a new shirt, or a new car if mine still works, or tickets to a sporting event etc. insert your favorite luxury item hereTherefore we must donate the money we spend on luxury items to relief agencies The only premise that I feel like might be subject to criticism is premise 1.

"66","CMV: Using BCE and CE instead of BC and AD seems pointless to me.","I’m not a Christian so I don’t hold any religious value to BC and AD, but I personally don’t see the point in using BCE and CE in their place. They are for all intents and purposes the same calendar, and to me at least, BC and AD don’t hold a religious connotation anymore. They’re just the years to me. From my point of view, it seems a bit pointless to change the name of the calendar, when it retains the same root. CE and AD are the same thing in all but name. The common era still comes from the biblical date for Jesus’ birth because it is based off of the Christian calendar. Is the reason people use common era dates not because of a religious reason? I understand that AD stands for Anno Domini, Latin for the year of our Lord. Is this seen as too on the nose for some people who are either atheists or believe in another religion? I don’t think the majority of people know about the Latin meaning of AD, and I can’t see a reason why CE is preferable to AD when they hold the same meaning in practical terms. Again as much as I understand that BC and AD used to hold a religious connotation, I don’t think that is relevant to the modern world. Perhaps that same reason compels others to adopt the common era naming system, but again to me it seems a pointless gesture. At least to me, it has lost its religious meaning. It’s just the date system that we use. To me it’s like how “committing suicide” has lost its old meaning as a crime against god, it’s just what people say when referring to the action of taking your own life. It’s lost all religious meaning in the modern day, and I think BC and AD are the same, and therefore I can’t see a reason to change the dates I use.","BCE is actually the Common Era, which is the convention we use to refer to the years since the birth of Christ. CE is the Contemporary Era, which means the current year."
"67","CMV: As a Gun Control Method, Banning ""Assault Weapons"" Makes Little Sense","Let me begin by stating that I am in favor of most gun control policy ideas, at least the more mainstream ones (i.e., better background checks, registration, and banning guns that are more dangerous). However, many pro gun-control groups are pushing for another ""Assault Weapon"" ban, just like the one we used to have 20 years ago. In the 1994, there was a federal bill passed, and then sunsetted, that banned ""Assault Weapons,"" which included AR-15 style rifles, and most groups pushing for assault weapon bans seem to want to import the definition from this bill.The bill in question banned the following rifles:*Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and has two or more of the following:** *Folding or telescoping stock** *Pistol grip** *Bayonet mount** *Flash hider** *Grenade launcher*The bill also banned some other forms of ""assault weapons,"" however this is the part of the bill that would apply to AR-15s. &#x200B;My problem is not with people saying that AR-15s should be banned, my problem is fact that this bill made no sense. On one hand, this definition allows to much. According to the bill, a gun can have a detachable magazine and a grenade launcher, but still not be considered an ""Assault Weapon."" I for one think that any gun with a grenade launcher is more dangerous than need be, regardless of if it has a pistol grip. On that note, this bill's definition also banned things that really have no bearing on how dangerous a gun is. For instance, why should a pistol grip matter? Or, why should a telescoping stock matter? I fail to see how adding a pistol grip to a gun makes it anymore dangerous. Basically, my problem with banning ""assault weapons"" is that it really doesn't change anything. Very dangerous guns are still able to slip through gaping loopholes and the guns that it does ban are not really any more dangerous than the ones that it does not. Also, conservative groups have pointed these facts out. While I tend to disagree with the NRA, they are very much correct when they say that a Semi-automatic gun with a pistol grip cannot do any more damages than one that has a traditional handle.  For these reasons, I don't think that pro gun control groups should be pushing for another assault weapons ban. Or, at the very least, they should not be pushing for the same definition. Instead, they should focus on things that actually make guns more dangerous. For instance, a better definition would ban all guns with grenade launchers, but allow cosmetic changes, like pistol grips.  Change my view.","The main problem with banning ""assault weapons"" as a gun control method is that these guns are not actually used in high numbers in crime. In fact, according to the FBI, ""assault weapons"" are not even currently used in high numbers in crime.The FBI's criminal justice reporting system categorizes firearms by their function and not their make. ""Assault weapons"" are not defined in this way, and are instead defined as guns that have features like a detachable magazine and a wide-gauge barrel. These guns are used in a very small percentage of crimes, and banning them would not have a large impact on crime rates."
"68","CMV:Contemporary mainstream Films lack a central creative vision because too many people are involved in making them","If anyone has heard of the  parable of the blind men and an elephant it is a story of a group of blind men who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and imagine what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective knowledge.So. How does this apply to filmmaking? Well. For starters they're increasingly not written by a person, but a committee. There are also notoriously a number of boxes to check. And each person is looking at a very specific aspect of the story that they think is the most important. While ignoring an overreaching central vision. Since films are consumed by one person, these disparate views create films which are flat and predictable.Another contributing factor is that filmmaking has become more democratic. A Kubrick film looked like a Kubrick film. A Tarantino movie the same. Now a James Cameron film just looks like... What? To me its just pandering to the lowest common denominator and you can no longer see the hand of the director in the work. Now. There are exceptions of course. Todd Phillips Joker would be one of them. But, it's also worth noting this was a low budget film. Costing around 55 million to make. But grossing over a billion. Why? I'd say a large part is due to the fact that Phillips vision shaped the film into something of his own and audiences crave that. However taking a risk on a small budget film like this isn't a sure thing for investors, so they're more likely to just put their money on avengers and be assured they can get it back.",".The main reason why so many people are involved in contemporary mainstream films is because they are made quickly and cheaply. This leads to a lack of a central creative vision because too many different people are trying to make their own individual contributions to the film rather than working together towards a common goal."
"69","CMV: The cliche of marriage being expensive is flat out wrong considering the value of combining resources","It's been a common trope that marriage is expensive. jokes have been made about it on sitcoms, in cartoons, stand up comedy routines etc but that legitimately couldn't be further from the truth.For nearly everyone the main expense they have is housing, for most people it consumes between 20 and 50% of their income. This really cannot be changed, especially in major cities where there is a very real lower limit to how much rooms, apartments, and houses cost, even in ""undesirable"" areas.[Americans are increasingly burdened by rent](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2018/04/american-families-face-a-growing-rent-burden) and with skyrocketing housing costs for many it's the only way they can get housing.But marriage, or a significant other you live with, is a big help to this on an individual level. Each partner cuts their rent expenses in half once they move in with each other, many stop needing roommates entirely because 2 people can live in a studio or one bedroom apartment. There are people who are able to live with multiple people in one bedroom apartments using bed sheets as walls, however, this is illegal in many jurisdictions due to zoning restrictions. With (roughly) twice the income, and twice the necessities, married couples often can better utilize buying in bulk, without worrying about food going bad prematurely, or that 18 pack of paper towels being enough to overdraw your bank account. This brings the cost per unit of necessities like groceries down as well. Buying in bulk has such a drastic effect on people's finances that it's been cited as a factor that [keeps poor families poor](https://www.wpr.org/study-low-income-households-miss-out-savings-because-they-cant-afford-buy-bulk)I cannot think of anything that gets *more* expensive per person when one gets married, due to the simple fact that combining resources is so effective at reducing costs.",".

"70","CMV: Everyone should wash their hands after using the bathroom","Hello everyone, All too often, I'm in the men's restroom, and someone goes from the urinal (or, worse, a stall) and straight out the door. And this is in *University -* I mean, these are teens and young adults. I should hope that the people around me are at least mildly familiar with how illness spreads. And I want to shame them as they are leaving, ""Hey, you forgot to wash your hands,"" but am kind of afraid they might spit at me for saying that. I mean, maybe they are just selfish people who do not care about getting others sick so long as they believe they have a ""strong immune system."" They are completely shameless, doing it in a room with me and others besides. If you have some sort of skin condition (my hands literally bleed during the winter) why not use lotion? If your hands literally cannot come into contact with water (very rare), why not use some alternative? There are vulnerable people out there, and handwashing has been proven to protect them. And unlike wearing a mask, washing your hands doesn't impede your day-to-day life. So, people who do not wash your hands, why? Is it just laziness, or is there something else going on? As it is, there are far to many of you to make ""forgetting"" a reasonable excuse.","There is no universal agreement on how often people should wash their hands after using the bathroom, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone do so at least 20 times a day."
"71","CMV: It’s not wrong to glorify historical people despite their immoral deeds.","Is it wrong to admire past great men just because their actions were violent or disliked by others in modern times? My view is no it’s not wrong, I do it to some of my favorite historical figures. But I’ve heard people say this reflects badly on who I am.Here’s some context. I recently got into an argument that often happens when praising historically great men. Being a fan of Hannibal Barca (the Carthaginian general), I retroactively admire his war against Rome. And in particular I said I was somewhat happy and felt it justified that Rome was eventually destroyed (pillaged) hundreds of years later as retribution for Hannibal’s loss. However, someone responded saying that it was wrong to praise the violence incurred on a city just b/c of my admiration for a once enemy of that city.In another example, I once made a post about Julius Caesar, praising him as a great polymath (which he was) and significant person. But people, admittedly truthfully, pointed out his brutal violence against innocent people, his sexual deviance, etc… and that he is not worthy of praise. And so praising figures that one would obviously not want to emulate today is a wrong thing to do.I can’t argue that these past figures didn’t do bad things, but I still admire and glorify these  individuals regardless. Does that mean I’m wrong and this reflects badly on my character (and anyone who does a similar thing)? I don’t think so, but I want to get to the bottom of this.","There are a few things to consider when answering this question. First, it’s important to consider what glorification means. It could mean honoring someone for their accomplishments and positive contributions to society, even if they have made morally questionable decisions. Second, it’s important to consider the context of these historic figures. They may have made morally questionable decisions, but these actions may have been part of their overall historical context and reflected the values of their time. For example, George Washington was a slave owner who led a war against Revolutionary France, but many people view him as a hero nonetheless because of his significant contributions to American history. Finally, it’s important to consider the intent of the person glorifying the historical figure. Some people may view glorification as an attempt to rehabilitate the historical figure, while others may view it as an attempt to condone the morally questionable actions of the historical figure."
"72","CMV: We should be electing two governments, one for social issues and one for economics","As the title says, I believe that if we divided governments into two parts, it would be beneficial for everyone of us.My main reasons for believing this is:- We could separate our economic, social and political (For political I mean things like foreign politics) beliefs, so that someone who is, for example, socially conservative and more left leaning economically doesn't have to decide whether he values more his social or economical beliefs.- As I said, we wouldn't have to trade our social or economic beliefs for their counterpart: this way, we don't risk being stuck with economic or social politics we don't like just because in that moment we value more the other one (I see this all the time: some people dislike most right-leaning social beliefs, but much prefer their economics).- In my idea, there could not be any crossover between economic and social parties: this would make parties less divided and much more focused on their objectives, without the need to balance social politics and economics. Parties would also need to cater to a smaller audience, so that their beliefs would be a little less nuanced and less diluted.Obviously, I recognize how some issues may arise from this:- Some economic and political doctrines are somewhat incompatible with each other, making it harder for the two parts of the government to cooperate- There isn't a hard divide between economics and social politics: they are extremely connected, to that also makes it harder for the two parts to cooperate. Defining what is the field of the economic government and what is the field of the social government could also be difficult.However, I'd expect that it would be hard for completely opposite social and economic doctrines to find themselves in the government, as social beliefs are connected with economic beliefs and vice versa, so that I wouldn't expect, for example, to find democratic socialists and hardline conservatives together in the government. I'd also put an executive political figure that would try to unite the two parts and help them cooperate and harmonize their different beliefs (It could be an elected president or, as I would prefer, a monarch, or anything else.)Why CMV: As much as I am interested in politics, I am no expert, so there is likely something serious I'm missing that would make this system crumble completely.",".If we were to elect two governments, one for social issues and one for economics, this would not create a more efficient or effective government.

"73","CMV:National Patriotism is illogical. No one should be proud of their country.","Patriotism is completely illogical. I will mostly be talking about patriotism in regard to the United States because I am from here, but I think there is no sense of being patriotic regardless of where you are from.First, no one chooses where they are born. Why would you be proud of this genetic lottery? You wouldn't be proud of being born in a certain hospital building right? ""Fuck yeah, I was born at John Hopkins!"". You’d be laughed at if you said that because it’s illogical and strange.Second, most first-world countries have a history of conflict and war crimes. In America, there existed centuries of slavery, genocide against Native Americans, segregation, lynchings, etc. Obviously, no one who is alive today participated in those things. But these were policies perpetuated by our government and under our constitution (the very same constitution we are currently operating under). No one should feel shame for those act since no one alive today carried out those acts (except for segregation as people from that era are still alive). But we wouldn't feel pride either right?Oftentimes you will hear conservatives say that we shouldn’t feel shame about slavery because it was in the past. So if we shouldn’t feel shame about our past mistakes, we shouldn’t feel pride for our past accomplishment either right? And even if you did contribute to those things indirectly (taxation funding NASA), it's not like you CHOSE for your money to go to the funding of space exploration. Your money went there because our (largely-undemocratic) government said it should go there.What about the good things ""we've"" done. Moon landing, spreading democracy (very arguable), stopped fascism in Europe. No one alive did any of those things (unless you are a WWII veteran). ""We"" didn't land on the moon. Engineers and astronauts worked for that to happen. They are entitled to feel pride because they accomplished that. Why should the rest of the country feel proud? I was born 30 years after that happened. Why should I feel proud about that? I didn't contribute to any of those things.Being proud of personal accomplishments is perfectly logical, but being proud of something simply because someone in your country did that? It makes no sense. Let's say I lived in an apartment complex called ""Oak Forest Apartments"". Then I hit up my city hall records office and found out that 20 years ago, a gold medal olympian lived in my exact apartment. Would it make sense for me to say “Oak Forest fuck yeah! Oak Forest pride! Oak Forest pride! All Oak Forest Apartment residents are Olympians”. I would be ridiculed if I did that. How is national patriotism different? These are arbritrary geographic lines.Don't get me wrong, I understand why people are patriotic. We are prone to all kinds of illogical behavior. I just don't think it makes sense when you really sit down and think about what patriotism is based in.","CV:There is no one right answer to this question. Some people may feel patriotic and proud of their country, while others may not feel this way. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what patriotism means to them."
"74","CMV: the fact that the term “incel” has now evolved to mean specifically a small sub group of involuntary celibates who are resentful and hateful etc - should have everyone enraged.","Let’s be very clear. Incel is short for involuntary celibate. Meaning you are celibate (don’t have sex) and that it’s involuntary (meaning you didn’t choose to have it that way. You want to have sexual connections but for whatever reason can’t) So just today, chatting on a different post, I learned that incel now officially refers to a group of criminal hateful misogynists. Apparently so much so that many of them become school shooters and serial killers. So now I can’t use the term incel not knowing if I’m referring to some innocent dude who’s struggling to find sexual connection, or if I’m referring to a mass murderer who thinks they are owed sex or whatever. When did this transition happen? And why isn’t everyone up in arms about it? Isn’t it like saying black people are all violent gang members? Or Arabs are all terrorist. “Oh yeah Arab used to mean someone from the Arabian peninsula but yeah it’s evolved now. Now Arab means terrorist. It’s the same thing” This seems like a really dangerous path to go down. On a side note, I’ve never actually met an incel (evolved definition) in real life. But I do know dozens of incels (original definition) and they’re all pretty cool people. (PS I’m not an incel. I’m young and single and do very well in the dating scene. Even if you don’t believe me please just assume that it’s true because I don’t want this to turn into personal attacks against me rather than debating my point of view).","There are a lot of people that are angered by the term ""incel"" because it has now come to be associated with hate and violence.

In many cases, the inequality is perpetuated by discrimination and sexism. While progress has been made in recent years, there is still a lot of work to be done in order to achieve true equality between men and women."
"77","CMV: Schools should pay you for good grades","A little prelude to how I remember my school life in my country (Germany):1. Oral participation was just as important as tests/exams. Meaning, 50% of your grade was determined by your participation in class, inlcuding answering teacher's questions, presenting your homework, volunteering for tasks...2. We had quarter-yearly reports on our grades within a single school year, which we could use as a standard for payouts.The most obvious benefit is that students will pay more attention in class to get their financial compensation. A lot of young children don't even get allowance from their parents, most teenagers all the way to high schools don't work any jobs.Another, albeit less obvious benefit is that we're teaching students how to be financially responsible at a young age. This ties in to the second sentence of my previous point.I can give an example model of how this could look like:1. Students, when enrolled to middle school, are taught about the model, rewards, and the such, so that they're motivated right as they get in.2. Both oral participation and tests flow in equal measures towards your grade.3. At the end of a quarter, schools write a quarterly report and immediately hand out money associated with the grade. The conversion from grade to money is explicitly shown.4. Example, C -> $1, B -> $5, A -> $10, A+ -> $20. These numbers can or should probably be adjusted from school to school, depending on local climate and how well it is receieved.The grades aren't attached to a specific grade of a test or anything, it's the combination of both oral participation and written tests that build up to your final grade on your school year certificate.There are some ideas here that I'm not entierly married to. We can probably adjust the rate at which payouts are given, and the exact amounts in $ can be quibbled over.**Edit:** After reading some of your comments, it appears my perception is biased towards German school systems. For those of you saying that ""only the smart kids from advantaged backgrounds are going to get good grades"", we have different types of school forms that students are sorted in after elementary school.  This way, students of all ""groups"" are segregated in a way so that they can still get good grades.The introductory paragraph of this Wikipedia article sums it up nicely.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptschule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptschule)","There is no blanket answer to this question as it depends on individual circumstances. Some people might feel that schools should reward good grades, while others might argue that doing well in school is a natural outcome of a good education and should not be financially rewarded. Ultimately, it is up to the school to decide what type of incentive, if any, to give students for good grades."
"78","CMV: We should afford the same level of respect and compassion to hungry people who can’t get food, that we do to single people who can’t get sex","I’m not an incel, I promise. I’m single, young, and doing very well in the dating field. (But even if you don’t believe me can we just assume that’s true because I don’t want this to turn into a personal attack on me, rather than discussing my point of view). I just think we’re all human and we all have craves and needs and desires, and these can be a source of distress and dissatisfaction for a lot of people. And I just don’t agree with the whole bullying and mocking incels trend that has become go fashionable recently.EDIT:Ok I get that without food you starve to death.

"79","CMV: when looking at the current state of the African Americans in the US you can’t deny the existence of systemic racism without imply drastic inherent inferiority of African Americans.","In this I’m going to begin with the term African American but then switch to black. Just to clarify I’m talking about black descendants of slaves brought to what was or what would become the US.What I mean by my title is that when someone says systemic racism doesn’t exist or that refuse to attribute the vast majority of the reasoning behind the current state of African Americans to systemic racism, you are, either intentionally or inadvertently implying that African Americans are inherently inferior.So hear me out, when looking at the how the black community developed overtime there’s it really any way that you can separate it from the 450 years of state sanctioned oppression and even more of social exclusion. You can very clearly see these effects when looking at overall statistics on poverty, crime, imprisonment, police deaths, etc.  None of that can really be looked at without the context of racism.When you take away the oppression seen and look at purely the statistics and not the history of why things are the way they are there’s only one real conclusion. Black people are in the state they are in because of culture and inherent characteristics that push them to act this way. For example let’s take poverty. In the US, there is a very clear gap between white families income and black families income. White families make roughly a 33% more on average than black people. About 1/5 of black people live below the poverty line when 8% for white people. So the explanation absent of the racial issues is that black people simply aren’t qualified or attempting to get higher paying jobs. Sure at face value, doesn’t seem crazy but if you press that, ask why black people less qualified while still refusing to attribute anything to systemic racism, you land at saying that they are underqualified because their culture prevents them from pursuing a good career as it does white people.This game can be played with every major problem in the black community today. People who deny systemic racism call it refusing to take personal accountability, but I think it’s more understanding history and how it affects people today.","The answer to this question could go either way. Systemic racism exists, but it is not inherent in African Americans. Some people might argue that racism is a system that disadvantages certain groups of people without their consent or actively working against their best interests. This would imply that African Americans are inherently inferior, although I don't think that is necessarily the case.There is no easy answer when it comes to systemic racism, as opinions will differ. It's important to remember that everyone has their own experiences and perspectives, so it's important to listen to others to get a more complete picture."
"80","CMV: Christianity as an ""organized religion"" is fundamentally flawed, cultish, fake, and full of liars","The idea of Christianity as ""organized religion"" sees it is, by definition, cultist. The word *cult* has a negative connotation, but by it's black-and-white definition, it falls into that category: *n. a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.* Anyone who associates with organized religion or ""the church"" falls under this category, regardless of which definition they decide to worship or which denomination they fall under.I do believe in a ""god""--but the existence of such cannot be proven nor disproven. It is entirely unknowable, by my beliefs, and to ""prove"" God exists (Christianity's God, here, as that's the subject matter) would invalidate Christianity, as one of the basis for the entire religion is that God *cannot* be proven, and thusly requires blind faith to follow. The ""what if it was proven that God exists"" argument is one of the main reasons I left the church; the argument itself is self-destructive and paradoxical.The Bible physically cannot prove the existence of God. All we know is that it's a collection of religious writings that has, shockingly, been able to evolve and adapt with the evolution of mankind. But mankind still wrote it. Take the Flood: we have scientific evidence that the Flood occurred. We have historical evidence and texts. But we also have *other* religions claiming the Flood happened, and it was also caused by their God. So it alone cannot prove the existence of God. Nor can the ""Pontius Pilate"" stone. Okay, so Pontius Pilate existed. That still does not prove the existence of God.More people use the name of Christianity to justify horrible acts than those who use it to facilitate good acts. Two examples: all of the LGBT+ hate, and obfuscated racism (Jesus constantly depicted as white and refined when he was a Middle Eastern carpenter, as an example). On a more surface level, take anyone who drives a car with the symbol of their church on it. In my experience, those people are some of the worst drivers and road ragers I've ever seen. I'm a full-time delivery driver; I see a lot of them.The Bible is more a wholistic guide on how to be good and treat others with kindness, in my opinion. Perhaps it was spoken to us from a higher being, or perhaps mankind wrote it themselves with a guide to ""be better"".What kind of God threatens eternal agony and punishment for those who don't love him? That's not love, that's forced subservience. ""Love me, *or else.*"" And if ""hell"" is simply separation from God...well that doesn't seem to be too bad, now does it? Will I look up to ""heaven"" and feel jealous? Maybe. But if I get punished for trying to be a good person and constantly improve myself, and simply not believing in a deity, that's not a God I want to worship.I'm an agnostic theist. Feel free to cite any sources, I'm curious to hear what you all think!","There is no one answer to this question, as people's conceptions of what constitutes an ""organized religion"" may vary significantly. Some people might consider Christianity to be an organized religion, while others might not. Additionally, some people might believe that Christianity is cultish, fake, and full of liars, while others might not."
"81","CMV: Fashion industry should include models of all shapes and sizes","Now that Victoria's Secret is making a comeback, there has a lot of discourse over slim, lean women being the predominant type on haute couture and high fashion runways. Because this type doesn't represent the average woman and is for some an unattainable goal, it causes many women to feel bad about themselves.    High fashions and haute couture shows should be relatable and make everybody feel better about themselves. If an online fast fashion store can show women of all sizes and shapes, why can't high fashion? Especially when women of different sizes and body types can see how the clothes would look on them!  There should be different body types. There should be a variety of plus size models, dwarf models, handicapped models etc. The typical model look is so uniform and it's boring to have everybody look the same. It would be so much better if designers made clothes for different types of the individuals, not just the very typical Barbie look with the same proportions. Why can't curvy women walk the runway, what's wrong with a bit of fat rolls, big thighs etc? The designers should represent that better! Why can't short women walk the runway, there should be more pieces designed especially for those who have shorter limbs and a more compact body type! Not every woman is lean and statuesque.","It is important that the fashion industry includes models of all shapes and sizes. This will help to promote body positivity and show that there is no ""ideal"" body type. This will also help to create more realistic images of fashion models and help to encourage people to be more physique-positive."
"82","CMV: Words that weren’t created out of hate like the N word are not inherently offensive.","EDIT: in the title I mean not created from a place of hate. In the CMV section I am referring to words that were created from a place of hate. Ultimately language only has the power we give it. If I use a term with no malice behind it and the person I’m talking to takes no offense, is it pejorative/negative/offensive/hateful? Why can’t we all just not use words with malice and then consequently no longer take offense to words. We could end almost all political, racial, and gender based division in this country if we stopped using words pejoratively and if we stopped taking offense. We need to stop putting hate behind our words and also stopped taking offense every time someone uses a word we deem offensive regardless of intent this world would be a lot happier. To CMV:Provide reasons that normal terms that are currently considered offensive should be offensive. Excluding race, gender, or sexuality based terms that were created out of hate like the N word and f*gg*t (typing that out made me feel sick, but I couldn’t just say the F word) because there are no ways to use them other than pejoratively. Words like gay, retarded, and stupid are on the table because of its original definition.","CMV: Words like nigger and the C word are inherently offensive, as they were created out of hate."
"83","CMV: the reason why people aren’t having kids is not because they are “too expensive.” It’s because having kids just kinda sucks.","Time and time again I read a new article about declining birth rates: in the US, in Japan, in Nordic Europe. Every time the researchers seem to be mystified: why aren’t people having kids??? And then I read the comments and a lot of people chime in with “well it’s because of expensive housing!” Or “it’s because of climate change!”So. Speaking as a very financially stable American woman in her 30s: I can totally afford kids. I just don’t WANT THEM. At least not now. They are annoying, interrupt my peaceful life, and put a huge drag on my career ambitions. I am EXCITED about other things I can do in my life other than having kids. Will I have kids at some point? Maybe but I keep on postponing it cause it just straight up doesn’t sound like a good time. My theory is that a lot of people feel this way too. Back when we had NO CHOICE whatsoever and no options, sure people had 5 children because what else was there to do? We were socialized into it and believed it was our only choice. But now that people know they can have a fulfilling career and make good money and travel and live stress free, suddenly raising children isn’t as attractive a lifestyle option.So imho governments can hand out as many financial incentives as they want- unless it’s a stupid amount of money (say an extra $100k per year per child) it won’t move the needle. Cause it’s not the fact that people are missing an extra $3k (Japan latest incentive) to have a kid- it’s the fact that people now (especially women) have so many more things to do that having children is simply not as exciting.","This is a common misconception.There are a number of reasons people are not having kids, including financial constraints, lack of desire, and a lowlife society that rewards individualism and abstinence. But parents aren’t avoiding parenthood because it’s too expensive. According to 2015 Census data, the cost of raising a child in the U.S. averages $245,000 per child. This is significantly more expensive than the average cost of raising a child in Europe, which is $157,000. So it’s not the fact that having kids is expensive that’s keeping people from having them – it’s the fact that parenting just isn’t all that great."
"84","CMV: John Wick is kind of a selfish asshole","Spoilers for John Wick movies, obviously. Also, I'm analysing this from the perspective of the movie's universe own rules and events, not movie rules, so ""if he didn't do it there would be no movie"" won't change my view.Maybe I'm missing something (it's been a while since I watched the movies), but it seems like at this point Wick is just messing up with a, uh, perfectly organised network of assassins and crime syndicates because of his personal vendetta. His actions have just become increasingly unjustified with each movie, compared with the first movie.Yes, Santino was an asshole in the second movie, but not for requesting Wick's help, but for asking for the murder of his own sister. I don't remember if Santino immediately tells John of his intentions and it's because of that that he refuses, but the fact is, a marker is a marker. And that is further established when John himself makes use of a marker to force Sofia to help him, so we can't really hold Santino back for that (there's the fact that John could instead just killed Santino instead from the get-go, buuut this is not about plot consistency).Also, if I remember it right, Wick wasn't banished for killing Gianna, and it was just Santino ""avenging his sister"" and not the High Table going after him. He was only truly banished and made a public enemy when breaking the rules of the Continental, something he could've perfectly avoided.And then, the High Table is posed as the ""big bad guy"" in the third movie, but we haven't seen anything that really make them look bad. It's a world of criminals and assassins, after all, and they haven't show us anything that make them out to be any worse than all the rest. They are just the overseers of the system, which seems to be working just fine. The Bowery King mentions the ""corruption"" of the High Table iirc, but what corruption? He's just another guy with a lot of power that doesn't seem to like to submit to others, and for the entire third movie they are just following their own rules and Wick and his friends keep bending and breaking.Granted, I do think that the array of overlapped systems create confusion and loopholes, like assassins having to honor a Marker that will break their own rules, but that just seems to be the way it goes -- John himself abuses of this system in the third movie, putting a lot of other people in danger, and then the High Table does what is expected of them -- punishing and going after the people who help John.",".There are definitely aspects of John Wick that are selfish, but it's also clear that he does what he does for the benefit of others and his mission. He's not without his flaws, but he's definitely a highly flawed but ultimately admirable protagonist."
"85","CMV: It makes sense to judge people for promiscuity and to judge women for it more than men","If I hear that someone has had an excessive number of sexual partners, yes I am going to judge them for it and think less of them for it and I will apply this more to women than men. I don't think this is bad or misogynistic.Having sex is inherently risky behavior even when using ""safe"" sex methods. Every time someone has a new partner they are taking some risk of getting permanent, life-changing diseases. They are taking some risk of either getting pregnant themselves or getting someone else pregnant (for heterosexual encounters). And going home with strangers all the time carries some risk of being raped, assaulted, robbed, or murdered. The only reward for taking these risks is pleasure so in this way I view promiscuity similarly to other risky behaviors like gambling or impulsive shoplifiting. I will conclude that people who engage in it lack self-control and the ability to consider the consequences of their actions. While this does not make them inherently bad people, it means they are likely not people I want to be friends with or in a relationship with, and I don't see anything wrong with this. Judging others on some level is absolutely necessary even though it does have negative effects.As for why I judge women more, it's because all the risks I mentioned affect them more. Many STDs have more severe symptoms in women, pregnancy is a much greater burden than getting someone else pregnant, and women are more vulnerable to being attacked by their partner. Therefore a woman who has had a certain number of sexual partners has taken even more risk than a man who has had that same number.Two caveats to this: some people have a genuine addiction but I think this is a small proportion of promiscuous people so I assume it is not the case. And people having sex with others of the same sex are taking less of a risk, but they are still taking risk. In this case, promiscuous homosexual women are only slightly more risk-taking than promiscuous homosexual men.I don't see this as misogynistic because it comes from real differences between men and women and not some kind of stereotype or bias I have. But since this is considered an old-fashioned view that is discouraged by many people nowadays, I want to know if there's something wrong with it so I am posting here.CMV","This is a difficult question to answer definitively because there are many factors that contribute to individual promiscuity, including gender. Some people may argue that women are more likely to be promiscuous because they are often sexualized more than men in the media and society, which can make them feel more urges to engage in sexual activity. Others may argue that men are just as likely to be promiscuous, given the prevalence of sexual violence against women. Overall, it makes sense to judge people for promiscuity and to judge women for it more than men, given the different experiences and challenges that they face in society."
"86","CMV: Missing free throws can cost you wins.","Greetings everyone. As a fan of basketball I need to get this off my chest. I'm curious as to how folks will take this point of view. One of my favorite parts about basketball is the buzzer beater. Having watched a multitude of buzzer beaters, I noticed a pattern. Maybe it's just me, but I've seen most teams win on buzzer beaters after their opponent misses either one or both free throws. In some games, a team misses the second free throw on purpose to run down the clock. It may make sense in that you want to give your opponent less time to heave a 70 footer, but what if the 70 footer miraculously goes in before the buzzer? Then the team missing the free throw either has to play overtime or outright loses! Players should always make their free throws! I can give an instance back in 2010 when Chandler Parsons won the game for the Florida Gators against the NC State Wolf Pack. The Wolf Pack intentionally missed a free throw before CP25 drilled a 70-footer. I was thrilled that the Gators won, but the announcers puzzled me when they said that missing the second free throw was a wise move on the Wolf Pack's part. The game would have gone to overtime if the Wolf Pack made the second free throw. I welcome disagreements and counterarguments with open arms, eyes, and ears. If anything, I would appreciate if there's another reason to miss free throws.","Yes, they can. And often times, they do. Free throws are one of the most important statistics in basketball. If a team is not making their free throw attempts, it can often result in their opponent scoring points. This can be detrimental to a team's overall win total."
"87","CMV: I don't like Russia and China.","I'll explain why, beginning with Russia.They paint themselves as a country who only defend themselves, never the aggressors. But history says otherwise. They have a history of ""purges"" of those inside their country who disagree with the status quo, even among their own (back in the Soviet Union, so many purges and harassments of people who were forced to leave).That leads us to only conclude they're terrible allies, and you best not disagree with them.And then there's China. They clearly want revenge on the world due to them being basically enslaved and humiliated due to the opium distrubition and nation wide addiction inflicted by the British centuries ago.It's quite clear they as a nation decided to rise up and conquer the world, grab it by the balls, make everyone DEPENDENT on them. Criticized them? You won't get your products. They've masterfully done it by creating cheap labor and industrial products and easy shipping, attracting the greediness of capitalism.I dislike them, I get angry just to hear about them - they're always on the news because they're important, of course.What pisses me off sometimes is that they have made themselves essential for humanity. If all Russians and all Chinese suddenly vanished, the rest of the world would crumble.Plus, it borderlines xenophobia and other extremist thoughts, to which i've fantasized a lot, which is why I want to get my view changed.","There's no two ways about it: Russia and China are not easy countries to like. They're vast, populous, and often quite authoritarian - features that can rub some people the wrong way. And their economic systems are decidedly different from ours, which can also be a turn-off for some.That said, there are a few things that many people in both countries - and around the world - admire. Russia and China are both genuinely large and powerful countries, and they're both steadily developing their economies. They're also major players on the global stage, and their influence is felt in a variety of ways - from geopolitics to economics to culture.Ultimately, what matters is what you think - and feel - about these countries. If you don't like them, that's okay. But don't downplay their importance or overlook the fact that they have a lot to offer."
"88","CMV: Nobody should believe that a scientific theory is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt without studying it.","My thesis is that nobody should believe that a scientific theory is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt without studying it.There are several key terms in that thesis, which must be explained:* ""Scientific theory"": A scientific theory, as I am using the term here, is a theory about the natural world that the overwhelming majority of the scientific community says has been established beyond a reasonable doubt using the scientific method.* ""Wrong beyond a reasonable doubt"": A reasonable doubt is a doubt that has some actual, substantial basis in fact or argument. I used this term rather than the term ""certainly wrong"" because I don't want to get into philosophical questions about whether absolute certainty is possible. ""You might be in the Matrix"" does not count as a reasonable doubt.* ""Studying it"": As a bare minimum, I want to say that you have to be able to accurately summarize the theory at a college undergraduate level, as well as the principal lines of evidence in its support, to dispute it. I am not saying everyone above that cutoff has the right to dispute the theory, but I am saying nobody below it should believe that the theory is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. (I am also not literally saying you must enroll in a college class.)As a clear example of what I'm talking about, consider someone who watches a creationist video on Youtube and decides that the theory of evolution is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. This person is not being reasonable, provided that they know that they're disagreeing with the consensus. They shouldn't think the scientific community is wrong about evolution with that much certainty without really knowing what they are saying or why.I am really interested to see how people dispute my thesis here! CMV.","There is no single definition of ""reasonable doubt,"" and it will vary from person to person. In general, however, reasonable doubt is a doubt that is based on the evidence and does not hinges on a personal belief."
"89","CMV: If a democratic government makes a mistake, its voters hold some of the blame","A democratic government represents the will of its people. Whenever you make a choice, it comes with some degree of responsibility for the outcome. If the people of a nation are given the choice over who serves in their government, voters have some degree of responsibility for the actions of the government they chose. When Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords, the rest of the world rightfully rolled their eyes at the US. Do the millions of Americans who voted for Trump not hold some degree of responsibility for such a backwards move in environmental protection? They willingly voted for a man who bragged about his plans to leave the agreement.If a government does something wrong, like wage an unjust war or deny its involvement in war crimes, it reflects on the will of the voters chose them in the first place.For example, Denmark deployed troops in the Iraq War. If you consider the invasion of Iraq to be unjustified, do the Danes not have some degree of responsibility for electing a government that decided to join the Iraq War? Denmark is not like Russia, a country where elites decide everything. Denmark is one of the most democratic countries in the world, so doesn't the actions of the government reflect the will of those who voted it into power?Another example, Japan routinely elects politicians who like to deny war crimes. The late PM Abe had close ties with Nippon Kaigi, an organization that claims Imperial Japan was a ""benevolent"" force for ""liberating"" Asia in WW2. Perhaps his original constituents in Yamaguchi liked him despite his war crime apologia, but doesn't this reflect the priorities of his voters? When his party elected him prime minister, doesn't this reflect the fact that Japanese voters think that war crime denial is justifiable as long as Abe delivers economic and military reform?","This is not a correct statement. Voters in a democracy do not hold all of the blame for government mistakes. To hold the government accountable, voters need to be able to express their opinions and hold their representatives accountable."

"91","CMV:prostitution shouldn't be legalized","I want to premise that I live in italy,so it's not a surprise that I grew up in a pretty conservative house,however while I don't have any strong political ideas,you could consider me a liberalI changed my view on many topics regarding personal freedoms,especially since as I said before,i grew up in a conservative housethe topics I mainly changed my view on are the following:decriminalisation of drugs,abort,trans rights,now i am an advocate for these rights after i did my reaserchthis brings me to the main topic,for the reasons above,i think a well constructed discussion could easily change my view,also i prepared a list of pros and cons i could find by myself:P1)the government could tax prostitution more heavily than other businesses,therefore giving more money to the government and less to traffickersC1) however this could also be a con since a taxation would incourage more people to turn to traffickers and the dangers that come with themP2)the industry could be better regulated to reduce the risk of transmitting STDs and the violence that goes towards prostitutesC2)i personally don't think a regulation will be enough since this will turn even more people to traffickers for obvious reasons like higher cost to start the businessP3) as much as it pains to admit this,these are still extra jobs for jobless people and a valid alternative to getting the bare minimum from the government every monthC3) only some people will be favorited in the business,wich means even people who work at these places won't have a stable incomeC4)this isn't really legal,but more of a moral principle for me,as this will most definitely make the adultery rate rise,and in a country like italy, families falling apart is a hit to the population growthP.S and Notice well,i am not a politics expert,so don't take what i said like absolute truth,i am probably wrong on some aspects","There are a few reasons why prostitution shouldn't be legalized. One reason is that it could lead to more promiscuity and STD's. Another reason is that it could be exploitation of the workers. Finally, legalizing prostitution could lead to more crime in the area."
"92","CMV: Misandry (sexism against men) exists, and it is a societal problem.","A common idea on Reddit is that misandry doesn't exist, or that if it does, it's individual prejudice and not something systemic.But I very much disagree with this idea. The vast majority of criminals, victims of violent crime, victims of workplace accidents, and homeless people are men. Statistically, men are twice as likely as women to be sentenced after a conviction, and receive sentences that are over 60% longer, which is even worse than the disparity between black and white people.Women outnumber men by an astounding 50% in higher education; if these numbers were reversed, you would already hear calls about ""sexist higher education institutions."" Study after study demonstrates that boys are underachieving in high school and that many teachers have an implicit bias against them in the humanities.The thing is, for every sexist assumption made about women, there IS an opposite assumption made about men. If women are ""weak,"" then men must be ""strong."" If women are innocent, men are *less* innocent. If women are judged by their looks, men are judged by their paychecks. And when these things happen, we don't call it misandry, we just call it a ""side effect of misogyny,"" which IMO is disgusting. Control the language, and you control how people think.Even worse, some people seemingly acknowledge that these issues exist, but then turn around and say something like ""well men dominate the halls of power so clearly it's their own fault for oppressing themselves so I don't give a fuck hahaha."" Now, to be clear, I'm not here to play oppression Olympics, and I certainly wouldn't take away from the trauma that women have gone through and still go through under our historically patriarchal society. But in the modern Western world, I feel like it's high time these issues are finally acknowledged.","There is no doubt that misogyny (sexism against women) exists, and it is a societal problem. However, there is also significant evidence to suggest that misandry (sexism against men) exists, and it is a problem.Misandry exists when men are treated unfairly or unfairly compared to women. Women are typically seen as the better half of the species, and as such, they are often given preferential treatment in many aspects of life. This includes but is not limited to:-Areas of employment-Academic opportunities-Rights and responsibilities in relationships-Levels of privilege and powerMisandry can take many different forms, and it manifests in a variety of ways. Some examples of misandry that have been documented include:-Policies that are designed to benefit women more than men-Women being given preferential treatment in courts and legal systems-Male victims of domestic violence not receiving the same level of support as female victims-Sexualized images and portrayal of men in the media-Men being laughed at or insulted for being emotional or sensitiveWhile misandry is not as prevalent as misogyny, it is still a problem that needs to be addressed. There are many ways that misandry can be combatted, and one way is by raising awareness of the issue. Another way is through the implementation of anti-misandric policies."

"94","CMV: Drug decriminalization without legalization is dangerously illogical.","By ""decriminalizing"" drugs *while keeping their production and sale illegal* you are simultaneously reducing the costs of drug consumption while keeping all of the negatives of the drug war. First, ""decriminalization"" without legalization ensures those drugs will be sold by and directly profit the most violent criminal gangs on earth. By definition, it ensures no non-criminal will be able to produce or sell drugs. Besides foreign drug cartels, domestic gangs that cause the large majority of murders in North America will have their monopoly on a massively profitable business. Beyond the literal mass murder these gangs commit, keeping the supply of drugs illegal ensures they cannot be regulated in any way. That means keeping drugs far more dangerous than would be due to unknown potencies and adulterants, which we know contributes largely to drug overdoses.That also applies to taxation, which cannot be done on illegal transactions. As a result, we all lose out on tens of billions in lost tax revenue that instead goes directly to criminals and mass murderers. We also lose the ability to reduce demand through taxation, as we have done with cigarettes and alcohol. Every piece of economic theory and historical evidence has shown that going after suppliers simply makes it more profitable for the more ruthless violent cartels that remain, and pushes users towards more dangerous drugs. The current overdose crisis is a direct result of the government going after prescription opioids, which pushed pill users to unregulated heroin and eventually fentanyl.Reducing supply artificially just makes it even more profitable for those that remain by driving up the price (and incentivizing new entrants). We've done that so successfully that there are almost no criminal gangs on earth not involved in the drug business. The only countries that have largely eliminated drug use are places like Singapore, China, and Saudi Arabia. These places are differentiated by going after drug *users* with extreme punishments, which reduce demand for drugs and thus the profitability of selling them. This makes economic sense: reducing demand makes it less profitable for sellers, though it's probably political infeasible. By contrast, decriminalization *reduces* the effective costs of drug consumption, even if only somewhat. Given all of that, I think decriminalization is at best ineffective and at worst will increase drug use, while ensuring those drugs remain extremely dangerous and sold by violent criminals.","There is a world of difference between decriminalization and legalization. Decriminalization simply means that minor drug offences should be treated as a civil rather than criminal matter. This can include things like counselling, treatment, and fines instead of jail time. decriminalization is a better approach than prohibition, which has only made the problem worse in the past.Legalization, on the other hand, means that the drug is made legal and regulated. This means that it is no longer illegal to possess, use, sell, or produce the drug. It also means that the drug is subject to the same safety and quality standards as other substances. While this may seem like a good idea at first, legalization can quickly go awry.For example, marijuana is currently legal in a number of states in America, but it is still classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under the US Controlled Substances Act. This means that marijuana is extremely difficult to researchers, and even harder to produce and distribute legally. This has led to a black market for marijuana, which is often dangerous and unregulated.Legalization would be a much better approach if it were done properly, but it is often done poorly and has led to many problems in the past. Criminalization is a better approach, and it is what we should be doing moving forward."
"95","CMV: Everyone should learn IPA","For those of you who don’t know, IPA or the international phonetic alophabet is a standardized alphabet to communicate how sounds… y know… sound.Basically, it’s so linguistics know exactly what sounds others are talking about, with having to say “eh” or “a as in about” when every single dialect is different.And, a lot of the time, there are people who are saying “how do you pronounce this?” And everybody says keh-sih-tuh or something stupid like that, instead, you could use the IPA! And as long as you learn that script you can be exact.Now, I’m just making this clear, I do NOT think we should use ipa as an actual writing system, it’s incredibly stupid, and if you want reasoning check out K. Klein’s video on it.The IPA isn’t really even that hard for people to learn! Most of the sounds are the same as in Latin, like /t/ is the exact same as the English “t”, then you just have to learn a dozen or so new symbols from the Greek alphabet and maybe some rotated letters, and boom, and sometimes if you don’t know how to pronounce it and you aren’t a linguist, you don’t need to learn the sounds that aren’t in your language.","IPA is a very important language for communication.

"96","CMV: Smartphones and modern social media have done more harm than good","First of all, let's get this out of the way: I'm not here to say ""smartphones bad"", ""social media bad"", I'm not implying they have done nothing but harm, there have definitely been good things that came from these technologies, a lot of them, but I think the negative things they have brought are so big they incline the balance that way.Modern social media revolves around getting users addicted so they can spend the most time possible using them and seeing ads, because that means more money. These companies have developed algorithms and methods so effective it pretty much feels like they hack your brain, I'm sure most of you have been in the situation where you grab your phone and instinctively open instagram or whatever without even thinking of it, you could do it with closed eyes because your finger already knows where it is, and you probably had something else in mind when you picked up your phone but forgot about it once you opened instagram and started mindlessly scrolling. It's become a great excuse to never ever feel bored and never ever be alone with your thoughts, and I feel like we need time with our own brains.  Now, it's not just that we open those apps without thinking, the content itself can get very problematic. The algorithms have gotten really good at showing you the exact content that will keep you engaged, regardless of what impact said content may have. it doesn't matter if you're engaged because you're happy or because you're angry, what matters is you're engaged, and that often leads to you only seeing questionable content such fake news, outrageous extremist views, unrealistic expectations (such as life goals or body image), among other things. These have brought very serious real life consequences such as increased polarization due to people never leaving their online bubbles (sometimes going as far as actual violence being pushed by social media, seriously, it sometimes feels like some people stop seeing those that think differently as human beings at all) and all sorts of mental problems such as depression and feelings of isolation.And speaking of isolation, it feels like we're lonelier than ever, turns out replacing such a big chunk of our social interactions for likes, shares and status updates does not actually improve the quality of our social connections, it just makes our junky brains go brrr because someone clicked a button when they saw our post, but then you see an old friend in person and there's nothing to catch up on because you already know everything new in their life since they publicly share all of it.","Many people nowadays use their smartphones or social media sites for their entertainment and relaxation instead of for communicating with others. However, the use of smartphones and social media has done more harm than good because it has increased the levels of anxiety and stress in people’s lives. In addition, smartphones and social media sites have also contributed to the spread of harmful diseases such as depression, anxiety, and addiction."
"97","CMV: Film (and video games and books) would be better off if there could be no more than one sequel, and no spin-offs or remakes","Of the top [40 top grossing films of all time](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW), only 4 are the first in their series (Avatar, Titanic, Frozen, and Jurassic Park) and of those, only one could be said to be an original story (Avatar). Even if you expand to allow sequels, only 5 of the top 40 are sequels (Avatar 2, Top Gun: Maverick, Frozen 2, Incredibles 2, Pirates of The Caribbean 2), and 3 of those are nostalgia sequels (Avatar, Top Gun, and Incredibles) that came out at least a decade after the original.With the massive success of franchises, there is no need to create an original character, plot, or setting, as you will be outcompeted by a generic Marvel movie or Disney remake. Also, many recent movies have been much worse off because they hunt the moneybags from cinematic universes (The Mummy remake, DCEU, Dracula Untold), instead of just trying to make an interesting story. Franchises also create the problem where no character or world can be threatened as that would end the franchiseIf franchises are bad, then remakes are even worse. A franchise can get by with very little new content, but a remake, by definition, usually adds nothing at all. Spin-offs can vary from just leeching off of the original (Minions) to actually pretty good (Logan), but generally don't add more than an original story would have.I am willing to concede that sequels give the original more incentive to succeed and allow a successful original to get the resources it needs to have a fuller story. I also fully admit that there are some good movies in franchises, like The Batman. However, as a whole, I believe that franchises do more harm than good for creativity.Edit: OK, I will say that a complete story that is simply too long to fit into 2 movies (like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) could be acceptable, as long as it is one large story, rather than something like a Marvel or Pirates of the Caribbean movie that is a series of individual stories. (not sure if this counts as a Delta)","I think this is a great idea! I don't want to see any sequels, spin-offs, or remakes."
"98","cmv:The sex service industry must be legalized. Having sex is a human right, and no country is qualified to ban it.","  In many countries, prostitution is banned. Even in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most states. But we have to face these questions: Why are we banning prostitution? Is sex one of the basic human rights? Is banning prostitution the right thing to do?First of all, I can guess that some people (especially women) will say: if sex industry is legal, human trafficking will be a serious problem. I disagree with this view. For example, as long as a country allows people to use cars, there must be traffic accidents in this country, right? So, should we ban cars? The answer is of course no. So, if you think the problem of ""human trafficking"" is going to get serious, then you just need to step up efforts to crack down on traffickers, not ban prostitution.Then, some people will say: prostitution insults women. Or to put it another way: The porn industry doesn't respect women. Please, it's really hard for me to understand why you guys think this way. Isn't it fair that a whore has sex with me and I pay her? It's as if you go to work in a company and the boss pays you, it's the same.So, I can't think of any reason to ban prostitution at all.More importantly, having sex is one of the basic rights of human beings, and banning prostitution is a blatant violation of human rights. Can you imagine? A 20-year-old guy lives in pain every day because he can't have sex with girls (for various reasons, like he's too shy to approach girls). Do you think all this suffering he suffered was necessary? If he had been born in a truly free country (like Holland) where prostitution was possible, he wouldn't have suffered these things. I want to say that his country has violated his human rights, and such a country should be sanctioned by the United Nations. I hope that such a country will perish immediately.So let's all work together to legalize prostitution in every country! Hats off to the Netherlands!","I agree with this statement.

"99","CMV: Comparing guns to vehicles does little to benefit either side of the argument, pro gun or pro gun control.","I constantly see people comparing guns to cars from both sides. Saying that, “cars cause tons of deaths every year too but we aren’t regulating cars.” And that “guns should be regulated the same way as vehicles.” Or that “cars are far more regulated than guns are”. I feel like all of these arguments are futile. First and foremost they’re two very very different things and to try and directly compare them isn’t really going to get you anywhere. Second of all this argument can be used for either side so what’s the point of really bringing it up if you’re being partisan on the issue? One side can say that guns should require insurance, registration, and safety requirements, plus a licensing system. Then the other side can say, you only need that to drive a car in public not to buy one, so with guns you’d be able to buy them without a background check and have a shall issue license for carrying in public that is valid in every state. If you’re standing for a middle ground take on firearms then this comparison benefits you I guess.

"100","CMV: Forcing artificial intelligence to pay or have someone else pay for it to view a dataset without imposing the same rules on organic intelligence is hypocritical, selfish, and likely comes from ignorance about one’s own nature as an organic machine","I realized at the center of ai art controversy, there is mostly money to be found as the reason for said controversy. Every video or story I’ve heard is about how the art belongs to the artist and AI should pay to train on it. It feels as if there is some level of correlation in these claims to those claiming non-fungible tokens are valid and copying them should be illegal. If a person views 5 different nft’s, learns the art style, and opens commissions for making similar art, should the nft creator be paid? Better yet, if an internet service provider allowed access to sites previously unreachable to the artist, but charges most of their income for it, leaving only room for payments of whatever the artist desired, should either of them be charged?And what happens when general intelligence is developed artificially? What of the biocomputers that have already been proven to function? Eventually the argument of “the intelligence isn’t human enough to count” will prove itself useless. And even though the intelligence is leagues behind ours, why does that allow for discrimination? We are just machines, certainly better than current ai but not forever. Do dumber things get special treatment because they are dumb, or rather, vastly inferior in every way but one? If so, why?The one argument that comes close is the human artist’s need for money, but that’s a capitalism problem, not an AI problem, and crippling AI won’t solve it, just temporarily prevent exacerbation of the situation.I am in a position where in order to pursue a dream, I need art. And to get the art I need from humans, I need money I don’t have and can’t get due to a crippling disorder. This is likely a source of bias, but I can’t find where it influences my logic to the point of invalidation. Hence my post.tldr: I just think artists can’t have it both ways without hypocrisy. Training with art made by humans for free while forcing non-human intelligence fractions to pay to train with their art seems hypocritical.Follow up question: if the developers of the AI only charged humans using the AI for the storage, power, and upkeep of the intelligence behind the art, would that make it more palatable?Edit: I need to sleep now, but the conversations have been excellent! Thank you for engaging in banter with me, and I will try to continue when I wake",".Imposing specific rules on AI, when we ourselves do not understand what those rules are, shows a lack of understanding of our own nature.

"101","CMV: Marijuana is the most dangerous and harmful drug in the world, posing more significant harm to society than any other drug.","I believe that marijuana is the most dangerous drug in the world and harms society more than any other drug. Yes, that includes drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine, crack cocaine and fentanyl.While I am aware of the argument that many of these other drugs have caused many deaths yet no deaths have been ""directly attributable to marijuana"", I believe that there are other dangers that are often ""invisible"" and not taken into account when considering the harm that a drug does to society as a whole.First, I want to begin by stating that I believe the widespread availability and social acceptability of marijuana potentiate the severity of marijuana's adverse effects on society because it discredits the seriousness of the drug's consequences (the following of which have been researched and evidenced). This is a significant factor in my view because I don't see how it doesn't open the door to widespread marijuana usage turning into what happened with cigarettes (with society widely accepting it as safe, only to regret it and deal with disastrous consequences decades down the road)\- Students who smoke marijuana have poorer educational outcomes than their nonsmoking peers \- Those who use it regularly may be functioning at a reduced intellectual level most or all of the time.   \-> Regular marijuana usage during periods of development in the adolescent brain has shown to be able to cause drops in IQ\- Heavy marijuana use has been linked to students being less likely to graduate high school, enroll in college or trade programs, and more likely to not want to seek employment. \- As perception of harm decreases, usage continues to increase.I believe that marijuana has robbed our collective society of so much productivity while also robbing its users of their potential. I can't help but imagine that out of the millions of people who have fallen victim to marijuana's consequences, society may have missed out on people who had the potential to accomplish things such as finding cures for rare diseases or cancers, but instead have had their futures stripped away from them by marijuana.I believe that these factors, along with the social acceptability of marijuana causing such factors to be exponentially more dangerous, are reasons to believe that marijuana is more dangerous to collective society than any other drug.\-","Marijuana has been shown to have a number of harmful effects, including:-Harmful to the brain and body. Marijuana use has been shown to impair brain function and increase the risk for chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. It has also been linked to harmful physical effects, such as a decrease in IQ, a propensity for car accidents, and chronic use can lead to addiction.-Harmful to the lungs. Marijuana smoke contains high levels of carbon monoxide, which can lead to serious health problems, including lung cancer.-Harmful to the public. Marijuana use is associated with increased crime rates and other social problems. It is also widely available on the street, which puts users and non-users at risk.-Harmful to the environment.

"102","CMV: aliens exist"," . Everyone’s entitled to their own beliefs !   I think the possibility of there not being life beyond earth to be more scary then the thought of aliens. We think of aliens (at least I used too) as ET ass mfs. But it could be a tree. There’s this particular planet [Kepler -186f](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2081/where-the-grass-is-always-redder/)( similar enough to earth that has a different star then we do, meaning the lightwaves would cause the trees in the planet to all be red instead of green. Doesn’t that observation alone prove the existence of aliens??? Aliens could be bacteria or tiny 1 cellular organisms , this is where I get into conspiracy mode . The 4th dimension , and beyond that is physically impossible to conceptualize to 3rd dimensional creatures such as us. Learn more here, video is very interesting. [here](https://youtu.be/JmvHNatZgVI) soI wonder , what could live in the other dimensions alone? And sticking to just the 3rd dimension, scientists believe life needs the same basic ingredients (organic matter, water, and to be in the habitable zone of its star) and that’s just a hypothesis. How do we know other planets don’t have elements we don’t have ? We can assume the planets in our solar system are mostly composed of the same compounds in different amount’s  because the collision that caused our planets to be formed pretty much just shot into huge chunks that over time turned into our planets and moons. But way beyond our galaxy is there not a possibility for more elements to exist ? And these elements could potentially play much different roles in evolution then the elements we have here on earth. Maybe I’m a huge dummy but not believing In aliens seems more probable than them just not existing. I feel like perhaps we’ve found evidence of aliens and we condition ppl into not believing people. I mean think about it, when have u ever heard someone say “I saw a ufo” and your first reaction wasn’t “this bitch done lost their mind”  there have been sightings( supposedly, but hey some have weight to them imo) even on live footage sense before smart phones and digital editing. But take that with a grain of salt, this isn’t contingent to my argument I just find that there have been too many sightings for a couple to not be somewhat accurate right? But I’ll admit I’m reaching on that one. So basically I fully believe in aliens and maybe 5% think we’ve spotted them, or      entered our planet. Like how can they just not exist?The article I listed doesn’t say there ARE plants on that planet, when I wrote this I remembered it wrong. We don’t know for sure there is plants on Kepler 186f and that was my Trojan horse so, yeah I still believe in thembut just wanted to make sure y’all know I wasn’t intentionally misleading anyone","Yes, aliens exist."
"103","CMV: Most chain restaurants should implement the “Run Forest Run” System","  **What is “Run Forest Run”? –** If you’ve never been to a Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant, there are [two signs](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.3de7d0982815942c27c42267494ed43f?rik=Zvx1UYOXmlF1ew&riu=http%3a%2f%2f2.bp.blogspot.com%2f-kctVmhd7CNQ%2fTiAlkrWNWhI%2fAAAAAAAAAGo%2fVEqy5UjDDyU%2fs1600%2fforestsign.gif&ehk=sBlRRGQJCRoLGKvvHb0LzWvIPRdiDVGhM9k39IQnrN0%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0) on all the tables. One labeled “Run Forest Run” which is displayed when the customers at that table do not require any assistance and “Stop Forest Stop” which is displayed when the customers need something like putting in an order, wanting to pay the bill, refills, etc. The idea is that when the stop sign is displayed, the first available server will address your needs.**My proposal** – Most chain restaurants (for example Applebee’s, BWW, Chilis, Outback, etc.) should implement a similar system where customers can easily denote whether they need a server’s attention and once the “Stop Forest Stop” equivalent sign is displayed, the first available server will help them. In my mind this has a few benefits including: not wasting the server’s time checking in on tables that don’t require assistance, increased table turnover from customers spending less time waiting for the bill/ordering, less variability in service quality since you’re not dependent on an assigned waiter, and most importantly getting rid of awkwardly trying to make eye contact with the waiter to get their attention.There are two complications I can think of if this system was implemented. First is with tips which in my opinion should be pooled if this were to be implemented. This would incentivize everyone to turn over tables quickly and respond to stop signs promptly. While there may be an issue with freeloading from some staff, a manager noting which servers tends to stop at tables more frequently and addressing the issue with the offending employee should offset that issue. The second complication would be with large parties (7+ people) where waiters may avoid serving due to the extra amount of work. In the case of large parties, while the signs would still be at the table to address small items like issues with food and refills, waiter(s) would be assigned for things like taking orders and they would receive at least a larger portion of tip left by the large group.Full disclosure: I’ve never worked at a restaurant which is why I think my view may be flawed in some way.","Many chain restaurants are starting to implement the ""Run Forest Run"" system in order to reduce the amount of waste that is generated. This system encourages customers to take their food and drinks to the nearest trash can and then run back to the restaurant to collect a free dessert or drink. This system helps reduce the amount of waste that is generated and allows customers to enjoy their food and drinks without having to waste time and energy travelling to the trash can."
"104","CMV: Cis heterosexual’s men public lack of attraction to trans women is social, not biological","To start off, you’ll often hear and read that only gay men can be interested in trans women, and a straight identified man who is honest about their attraction to one is a lying bisexual or closeted gay man because that attraction is inherently homosexual. I disagree and I think the aversion that heterosexual men in the west tend to have towards trans women publicly (because many will admit it in private) is due to society and how their culture has shaped their understanding of sexuality along with stigmatization[Attraction to trans women is gynephilic in nature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27858199/), and the men who are *mostly or exclusively* attracted to trans women show arousal patterns that align more with heterosexuality. I think heterosexual men can **naturally** be attracted to trans women like [Bailey Jay](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/bart_calendar/8134480/107163/107163_600.jpg), [Kataluna Enriquez](https://people.com/thmb/uLAmgMVeljBv1VslKYYkKTVsjeM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(490x205:492x207)/miss-nevada-5444748d1fbc45a6ad6ab0cf208f21ae.jpg), [Amiyah Scott](https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amiyah_Scott_Feature_Image.png), and if they possess a penis then they might be deemed **less** attractive than a cis female that’s equal to them in looks, but the attraction doesn’t die completely because they still possess a phenotype that leans far more female. Losing all attraction upon learning trans status is socially influenced I believe that attraction in general tends to be to a combination of things like phenotype and gender expression : - For much of human history, and prior to christendom in the west, it was normalized to have sex with feminine males. It wasn’t deemed gay nor was it stigmatized, and as a result most heterosexual men would partake in this- In American Samoa there is a third gender category called fa’afafine who are comprised of feminine males. In that culture fa’afafine are well accepted, and not only do most people claim to be friends with one, most of the men in that culture have had sexual relations with a fa’afafine. This is not considered gay nor is it stigmatized- In Oaxaca, Mexico among the Istmo Zapotec, there is a third gender category known as Muxes which is comprised of feminine males. These feminine males do not have relationships with each other but exclusively date and sleep with men that are considered straight. This is such a normalized practice that these Muxes are seen as legitimate competition by heterosexual women for male attention. [Up to 85% of Istmo Zapotec women have reported to have competed against a Muxes for a man](https://newslinesamoa.com/canadian-university-study-looks-at-sexual-competition-between-samoan-women-and-faafine/)Taking all of that into consideration, the unattraction and at times even repulsion to trans women that western straight men in particular express is influenced by their culture due to how sexuality is constructed in their society, as opposed to being some biological reaction because they’re not gay. Heterosexual men are responsive to both sex and gender (fem/masc), so I do believe in general they’re more physically attracted to cis females, but they’re not naturally unattracted and repulsed by a trans woman, especially one who is post-op and is externally phenotypically female. Attraction to trans women is not inherently homosexual","There is no scientific evidence to support this claim."

That's like saying the Cowboys suck because a 49ers fan told you so2) If it was the devil's influence, why would I be punished for doing his bidding?

"106","CMV: small voice recorders and discrete cameras should be allowed in school","The reason I say this is because of bullying in school. As a first hand victim of school bullying(2 years in a row) the reason the bullies weren’t punished was because of a “lack of evidence” and frankly security cameras are not enough as they are normally low res and don’t capture audio/ unable to capture audio because of how loud a classroom is. Allowing these small recording devices (implanted in hats, glasses and stuff) will prevent bullies from bullying as the victim now has concrete evidence to report and get the bully properly punished. If I was allowed to carry around recording devices when I was In school I would’ve been able to successfully report that student, get that student punished and removed from the classroom. What happened instead is he didn’t get punished and I was stuck with him for another 6months of constant bullying. If a student is not comfortable with that then they should switch to online class or homeschooling where bullying can be tracked with very hard to erase evidence or bullying doesn’t happen at all. And since everything already does get recorded in society so why should it be any different in schools(Sorry for bad English it isn’t my first language)","There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the legality of small voice recorders and discrete cameras in school varies from state to state. In general, however, small voice recorders and discreet cameras should generally be allowed in school, as they are generally considered to be non-threatening and generally used for educational purposes."
"107","CMV: The hypothetical argument made by Jehovah Witnesses that eating blood and injecting blood is still consuming is not a false equivalency and is therefore valid on that basis.","We've hired a Jehovah's witnesses a few months ago and had multiple discussion about his religious beliefs.   One of them is that consuming blood in any form is prohibited e.g. you can't eat nor can you get a blood transfusion.The why is as usual in religious people that it's written somewhere in their scriptures, ""that you shouldn't be consuming blood"".  The main hypothetical to defend the view that blood transfusion and consuming alcohol was this one:""If your doctor gave his patient the order that you shouldn't be consuming alcohol, instead now he injects it into his veins, you would still be arguing that he is consuming it""Another colleague of mine interjected and said that that's comparing ""oranges with apples"" that blood is vital for life while alcohol isn't, so it's a false equivalency.But I don't think that's relevant to the point.  The hypothetical just wants to show that injection is still a form of consumption, it's rather irrelevant what  you inject. You can replace alcohol with anything and it still would be valid argument.To CMV you would just have to prove that it is indeed a false equivalency.

Think about it. For example you are going to school for hair and makeup. You have a job as a manager at a chain retail store let’s Walmart or Ross. Why not get a job in a hair and makeup store like Sephora, Ulta, Sally’s.  Working at Sephora would look better on your resume not managing being a manger at Walmart.

"110","CMV: Reparations for black people should be gauged on the reparations for Japanese internees","Reparations for slavery and other systemic forms of racism have been discussed over the years, and it seems we may be close to a head on these discussions.My view is that these discussions should be contextualized by the reparations the US government actually paid to Japanese who were interned in camps during WWII. The simple fact is that nobody who is alive today in the United States was enslaved. Neither were their grandparents, or their great grandparents, or their great-great grandparents. That is not a wrong that can be effectively redressed today simply because nobody who is alive today was directly affected by it. However, there is very real systemic racism that occurred recently, in the 1960s federally and several years afterwards in individual states. Reparations are not something that I was initially receptive towards, but I have conceived a path forward on this matter. Japanese internees during WWII were paid a total of $1.6b in 1992. Adjusted for inflation, this amounted to just over $41,000 for every living person who had been interned. I don't know about you, but I personally believe that being interned by force in camps trumps anything black people encountered in the 1960s and beyond. So giving every black person alive today $40,000 is an insult to the Japanese internees. I don't think we can seriously say that being ripped from your home and forced into camps is better than being segregated by race. It's not in the same ballpark, and it's the closest this country has gotten to slavery since the Civil War. I would propose that every black person alive today be given a cash amount between $10,000 and $20,000. I've heard crazy proposals of giving black people $5 million, and I've of course heard arguments that no reparations are necessary. This is my compromise. And one could say that we shouldn't use the Japanese reparations as a baseline, because the Japanese internees should've been paid more. On that I agree. However, even if we had paid Japanese internees more, I don't believe that would raise the bar for black people subjected to segregation all that much. The simple fact of the matter remains that internment is a hell of a lot worse than segregation. So I would support $10,000 to $20,000 to every living black American today. I, who up until very recently thought reparations as a concept were absurd. I don't think you can find many people who would truly support more than that, nor is it even feasible to pay more than that. If you think inflation is bad now, just wait until 33 million people have an extra $10,000 in their pocket all at once. That would actually hurt the people reparations are trying to help in the long run.",".There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the magnitude of reparations owed to different groups of victims will vary significantly. Some argue that black people are not entitled to the same level of reparations as Japanese internees, given the continuing legacy of racism and discrimination faced by black Americans. Others contend that the level of reparations owed to black Americans should be significantly higher than the $20 million paid to Japanese internees, given the Lamont Hawkins case – in which a black man was awarded $3.4 million in reparations for racial discrimination – and the prevalence of institutionalized racism in the United States. Ultimately, the magnitude of reparations owed to black Americans will be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual circumstances of each victim."
"111","cmv: Executive pay does not make up a meaningful portion of most large US companies' budget, and thus cutting it would do little for the average worker","When discussing the topic of equality in the US, I often hear record-high executive pay mentioned as one of the primary reasons why wages have remained stagnent while productivity has increased.To look into this more, I decided to create a spreadsheet of 45 companies in the S&P 500 divided evenly among all major sectors. For each company I measured, it's total number of employees, total executive pay (by adding up the pay of the executives listed on Yahoo Finance), annual dividend payout, and annual share repurchase spending. Upon recording these numbers for each company, I created these three metrics which ended up having the following median values:Annual executive pay per employee -> $227Annual dividend payout per employee -> $39,606Annual share repurchase spending per employee -> $29,093As you can see, executive pay per employee equates to only about 3 days of minimum wage work per year, whereas the median dividend payout per employee is actually higher than the median annual salary in the US. That's not even to mention that the median share repurchase spending per employee is just shy of the median income in the US.(**Note**: In my findings most companies had a high dividend payout, and significantly lower spending on buybacks, or high spending on buybacks, and a significantly lower dividend payout. So, looking at the median for both could create the misperception that companies are spending a lot of money on both, when in reality most companies are paying mostly one or the other.)Seeing this clear disparity leads me to believe that the discussion around executive pay is pointing at the wrong thing. If workers want a stake in the profits of their company, the bulk of the money is clearly in dividends and share buybacks. I realize that rich executives flying in private jets as their company lays off workers isn't exactly a great look, but the numbers seem to imply that that isn't making a big difference. In my research, I found that executive pay was consistently measured in millions of dollars, whereas dividends and buybacks were usually measured in billions, and as the saying goes,""The difference between a million dollars and a billion dollars is roughly a billion dollars""","This claim is mostly inaccurate. While the executive pay at most large US companies is high, it is not the only expense on a company's budget. Further, while executive pay does not typically account for a significant portion of a company's overall budget, reducing it could have a positive impact on worker incomes"
"112","CMV: Light pollution isn’t something we should be worried about","I’ve recently seen a couple people online saying things such as “in a couple years we will struggle to see the stars from earth”. And while I can see their perspective, in that the night sky is pretty and fun to look at, changing urbanization shouldn’t halt for that alone. Another thing is that I’ve seen people complain that we will see more satellites than stars soon, but again that’s almost entirely an aesthetic problem. Satellites are made to for long distance communication and surveillance (which can be considered a different problem, not one I’ll discuss here) and I think it’s a net good for human progression. Again I don’t see a huge population of people saying light pollution is a huge problem, but I still think it’s a bit of a basic problem that we can largely ignore. That being said I don’t want to pollute the atmosphere with unnecessary satellites because they will only increase the risk for other satellites and orbital structures.Edit: all current replies are about the disturbance to circadian rhythm for animals around urban areas. From the two articles I’ve read the effects, while defiantly not ideal, are relatively minor: [National Geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/light-pollution/). This article also talks about how some cities are able to restore bird migration by encouraging more blue lights during migration season.Edit 2: upon closer consideration I think it is more of a problem than I originally thought. We obviously shouldn’t halt our growing urbanization (well not for this specifically at least), but there are other solutions we can use with relatively minor cost that will help the environment a decent amount.","According to the World Health Organization, “light pollution is a global environmental problem with potentially serious health implications.” While it’s certainly not something we should be overly worried about, there are a few things we can do to help limit its effects.One way to reduce light pollution is to reduce the amount of lighting in our homes and offices. This can be done by switching to more energy-efficient light bulbs, installing blackout curtains or shades, or using artificial light only during necessary hours.Another way to reduce light pollution is to take steps to protect our environment. For example, when buying a new car, consider purchasing an environmentally-friendly model that produces less pollution. When we can, we should also try to avoid using electronic gadgets in dark rooms, since they produce a lot of light pollution."
"113","CMV: True Crime biopic/shows need to end","The fact that these shows are even in existence at all is insane. It takes away from the victim(s) entirely and often showcases these serial killers and monsters in an empathetic manner. To me, there is something truly sick about some committing these unspeakable crimes, and then 30 or 40 years later, Hollywood decides to spend millions of dollars producing a show entirely about that person.I am not doubting that these shows don't sometimes portray them in an accurate light, but I also think that often times, the filming style still reads as ""look at this badass, kicking ass and taking names"", and even if they are portrayed accurately, as a fucking evil loser, I just don't understand why it needs a feature film/tv show. It also doesn't help that sometimes, these victims family are furious that their loved ones death is a plot point in a production that they didn't even consent to, that retraumatizes them, and goes on to win awards and praise. I truly believe this is why many people advocate to not show pictures of mass murderers/school shooters on the internet, because it is exactly what they want, to become a ""personality"" or house hold name, and maybe one day Evan Peters is going to play you on TV!(Just for clarification, I am not referring to documentaries/ Dateline style shows, I don't necessarily agree with those either, but I am referring to acted shows)","I completely agree with this!

"114","CMV: Student loan debt forgiveness is a political game","I’m struggling with this as a politically left-leaning moderate, and hopefully-thoughtful person. Paid off private school debt years ago, with money earned from jobs I needed in order to whittle it down.Offering student loan forgiveness is a political move to win favor, because who *wants* their school debt? It’s much easier to frame it as an injustice and crippling financial burden, and prevalent enough that it’ll win votes from an increasingly squeezed, college-educated middle class.I understand that student debt can be a massive burden and limit a person’s freedom to follow their interests—instead having to focus on grinding out earnings to pay down this enormous thing. In every single case, however, the person chose to incur the debt. A college education is not required to be financially successful, and nobody woke up one day with a lump of student loan debt they never agreed to take on.I understand that I am biased, because I paid mine off and I’m naturally inclined to be jealous or dismissive of someone that may not have to pay off theirs. Having to deal with the debt shaped how I spent my time during and immediately after college, constantly having some source of income that’d let me eat and live indoors while working down an uncomfortably large balance. I also entered a more welcoming and opportunity-filled job market than many that followed.But shouldn’t we deal with the consequences of our actions? This is not one of those murky areas where we’re limited by genetics, race, or other factors over which we have no control.In the U.S. a person probably needs a car to do basic things like buy groceries and get to work. Does that mean that auto loan forgiveness is coming next? People need to live somewhere and houses can be stupidly expensive—disproportionately to living wages in some places. Are mortgages an injustice to be toppled and wiped clean?These things seem like a big score with people that would like to shed responsibility they explicitly took on, at the expense of the business or organization that offered the product. (And at the expense of the debtor, if you buy into the theory that the loan motivates financial discipline.)This is more populism, not a prudent and sustainable way of improving peoples’ lives. It’s trading responsibility for votes and letting someone else handle the bill.","""It's kind of like a political game,"" said Steven Warshak, an associate professor of business at Temple University's Fox School of Business. ""I think the motivation is good, but there are a lot of unintended consequences.""Warshak, who also served as an advisor to the Obama campaign in 2008, said that forgiveness programs could have a positive impact on individuals who struggle to pay off their debt, but they could also have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.""If there's too much forgiveness, then it could potentially lead to more debt,"" he said. ""And once you have too much debt, it's very difficult to get out of it.""Warshak added that forgiveness programs could also incentivize students to take on more debt in the future, as they would no longer feel the pressure to pay it off as quickly as possible.""It's a way to give people a break, but it also creates a social norm of taking on more debt,"" he said."
"115","CMV: Feminism combined with capitalist values is systemically antithetical to the continued existence of the human race in the face of industrialized society","To be clear from the outset I would consider myself a feminist. Ensuring the rights of women that have been gained is critical and pushing for more strides is needed. I am also sympathetic to antinatalist thought so the discontinuation of births is not really a crisis for me beyond its potential economic implications. However, it has occurred to me over the recent discourse about birth rates that if we take the facts that: 1) Liberated women generally enter the workforce. 2)Entering the workforce generally requires interaction with the demands of capital.  3) Success in capital generally requires the internalization of capitalist ideology. 4) Capitalist analysis under industrial or “developed” material conditions generally paints children as a net negative to the parents interests under the ideology of capital. 5) People generally act within what they perceive to be in their interest.Therefore: The introduction of feminist thought into developed society will lead to birth rates falling below replacement. When all genders are in the workforce child rearing become a societal afterthought. This is corroborated from everything I’ve seen out of the parts of the developed world I keep an eye on (mainly the Anglo-sphere, Europe, and China, Korea, and Japan in intensity of tabs keeping in that order). TLDR; Would love to have my mind changed on feminism combined with the ideology of capital being incompatible with continued human existence.",".I disagree with this statement. While I understand why you might think this, I don't actually think this is true. Feminism and capitalism may have some issues, but they are not mutually exclusive - they can exist together in a healthy way. For instance, one way capitalism could be beneficially influenced by feminism is if it led to more equitable wages for women. Additionally, capitalism can also be beneficial to women if it helps them to achieve economic independence. Other examples can be found if one looks for them.My main concern is that if feminism and capitalism are not mutually exclusive, then the system will be corrupted in some way. This could lead to exploitation of women, which is something I vehemently oppose."

The US should do something similar. Misinformation is a huge problem, and people with high follower counts can be perceived as trustworthy sources when they can just as easily be lying about their credentials or education.**Social media should have a system for verifying a persons' qualifications and making them prominent, so you can see if a person giving medical advice is actually qualified to talk about this.** I think this would visually be similar to Twitter's verification check mark. A user submits their qualifications, things like degrees or professional licenses, into an internal system.  The only information that is revealed to the public is the qualification.   This would be a voluntary decision if you want the qualification to be visible.If the system was enacted, I think it should start with just subjects like medicine or  finance that have a higher risk of harm caused by misinformation. To clarify, I do not think the focus should be on content moderation. Its not about prohibiting people from talking about certain things, its not about moderating what people are saying, its not about enacting a professional consensus on a subject. Its just a system so that you can see if your information is coming from a person with qualifications.Its not a perfect solution but I think it would help crack down on misinformation, especially among those who want their information coming from direct sources.  I'd be interested in seeing other's opinions on this","Some people believe that social media should have ""qualification checks"" in order to ensure that the people who are posting are credible or reliable sources of information. There are pros and cons to this suggestion. On the one hand, it could help to ensure that people are posting accurate information.

Ultimately, it is up to social media platforms to decide what qualification checks are necessary."
"117","CMV: Ukraine is not attacking civilian targets in Russia","This rarely makes it to the news on Reddit, but since the beginning of the “special military operation” Russia has been reporting numerous attacks on various targets inside Russia near the border, especially on Belgorod and Shebekino. In most cases the targets reported are civilian objects. From the reactions in pro-Western mass media it appears that a good portion of people believe that these attacks are carried out by Ukraine. I don't think this is so, because:* While most of the time the attacks are said to be carried out by Grads (not-so-precise multiple rocket launchers), quite a few reports mentioned HIMARS and other precision artillery. Makes no sense to waste these targeting private houses.* It seems that it would be feasible to cover the most targeted areas with anti missile defense systems, or *something*, but I don't see anything being done.* Most importantly, there's no point in attacking civilian targets. This is not a show of power since Ukraine is not advertising or even admitting the attacks in any way, and the opinion that the attacks serve as a means of intimidation is hard to take seriously.Now, it's fair to ask, if not Ukraine, who is bombing Russia? Well, it's hard to say what exactly is going on given the one-sidedness of the reports. But these attacks serve as a major point of internal propaganda. I've heard opinions like, “I had no opinion about the war until they started attacking us... When they started bombing Belgorod they became our enemy”. So it would make sense for Russia to stage the attacks on its own territory, but maybe not even that would be necessary. What you need is not actual explosions or casualties, but pictures of destruction, butterfly mine sightings and perhaps loud bangs.","There is no evidence that Ukraine is attacking civilian targets in Russia.

"118","CMV: The idea of a world ""peace"" is more terrifying than nuclear war ever could be.","Let's be honest, no one (at least not in my opinion) wants 'world peace'.  It's a forced buzzword that people say to gain instant 'mhm, yes'.  Like saying 'me like long walks by beach'.  It's a cliche.World ""peace"", to me in reality, is TERRIFYING.  A government able to fully immerse itself in its own land now has the ability to focus on ways to control its populace.  A society not distracted by war now has more time to innovate and create technology, which governments will use to gain control.  Governments can't control if they're distracted by nuclear war.  They are too busy to enforce zoning laws.  They are too busy to enforce drug laws.  And they are too busy to find ways to tax people.  They cannot allocate resources to give local authorities more equipment to assert authority.  Every country worldwide, not distracted by nuclear war, not needing resources to fight, uses those resources inward.As bad as it sounds, war is a necessary horror that distracts governments.  They can't do EVERYTHING, they have to allocate resources.  The more nuclear explosions, the less resources governments can use.Peace, ideally, would be a world where everyone is positive and doesn't create these evil laws or use technology to enforce laws.But because humans are parasites (I use this term technically and not like a 1990s edgelord, because, let's face it, we DO act like parasites on a global scale), we choose to ruin things.  Nuclear war makes this slightly more difficult due to the fact that we now have less equipment to do this.Of course, this is a conclusion I've come to and I really don't like it, which is why I'm looking for a view change.  But I am terrified of a world where the government and people innovate and create new ways to control and screw over my life.  I feel like nuclear war would solve that problem (I am PERFECTLY fine dying in it, I either die instantly or I get to enjoy a few months of traveling and then die a rather painful and horrific death, but a death I understood nonetheless.).  Maybe I'm just a very messed up selective pessimist for what most people see as a positive, and a very messed up selective optimist for what most people see as a negative.  If peace made it IMPOSSIBLE for this, I'm down!&#x200B;Yes, I haven't slept in a day.","There is something to be said for that. Nuclear warfare is catastrophic, and the effects of a nuclear attack can be felt for decades afterward. A world in which nuclear war was constant, oratorical rhetoric forced nations into peace treaties, and the fallout from these treaties poisoned the planet would be a nightmare.What's even more terrifying is the idea of a world in which nuclear weapons have been completely eradicated. It's a utopian fantasy, of course, but that doesn't make it any less terrifying. If nuclear weapons could be completely eliminated, it would be a step in the right direction - but it would also mean that humanity is teetering on the brink of extinction, and that the risks of another nuclear war are incredibly high."
"119","CMV: Corporations support the LGBT for money, not love.","Corporations do not support the LGBT community out of love. They support the community because it brings in money/customers, or retains customers. I am specifically talking about corporations and not local businesses or mom and pop stores. Everything a corporation does must be for the benefit of its shareholders and that practically always means “make more money.” Society and media has decided that LGBT representation is of great importance. Any company not showing support for the LGBT community is at a great disadvantage, because the customers will stop supporting the company. If society decided tomorrow that sacrificing goats is a good thing, you best believe Apple is going to buy some goat farms. Companies in all sectors show much support to the LGBT community. They often boast about their percent of staff that is LGBT, hire LGBT people, and change their twitter profile to a rainbow once a year. There is even a metric for companies: ESG, environmental, social, governance. Investors can choose what companies’ stock to invest in by comparing how a company is governed and one of the ways to get a better score under Governance is “Composition of the board in terms of diversity & independence”. It does not feel like a leap to suggest that LGBT candidates are not hired/promoted due to merit, rather they are hired to fill a quota. You ever notice how companies showing support for the LGBT communities in America have a neutral or no stance on the matter in countries where the LGBT community is not popular? That is because those corporations would lose money and customers for supporting such ideas. Do not think corporations actually care about the LGBT community, or any specific social issue for that matter. The bottom line for the vast majority of corporations is: If it makes more money, do it. Nothing else really matters.Edit: View Changed!

Apparently some people are so proud of being in the military that they have special stickers for it?In my (European) country we generally don’t have this attitude towards people who work in the army at all and I don’t understand why this is the case with the USA, especially if you consider the fact that no one is actively threatening this country’s borders.To most European people I have talked to, the American army is not heroic at all, it’s just this country’s tool to exploit young naive people and send the off to become murderers (and risk getting murdered themselves) for the capital gain of this country.Personally, I don’t find anything admirable or respectable about that. I am open to having my mind changed though, because I admit I am not really that knowledgeable about the topic, so I could be missing something.","The vast majority of Americans who work in the military are admirable and heroes. Military service is one of the most important ways that Americans can serve their country and protect its citizens."
"121","CMV: I am an atheist but I don't care one bit what you might believe in ; however, if I achieve something great and you impute it to god, I'm gonna be pissed.","I'm a psychology student and in the past two years I've really learned to be open to anything. I'll admit it, I was very close-minded ; I was a *my way or the highway* kinda teen. I've grown past this, and the university I study at is very cosmopolitan place. The friends I've made and the people I've encountered brought me so many different points of view in such a short time that I've abandoned most of my previous, nauseous views, and shifted towards a *you do you* mentality.This is one big exception though, if not the only one. I get people are religious. I get it helps you. I get it brings you strength, courage, whatever you want it to bring you. But if I do something great, like ace my exams, or land an awesome job, and I tell you about it to share my happiness, and you say ""God has a plan"" or ""Thank you Lord for this wonderful gift"", Ima be pissed.I'm not talking about the reflexive tendency to say ""Thank god"" when something happens, I know god has a big place in our society and we all do and say stuff related to, for instance when someone sneezes. This is different. This is attributing **my** efforts, **my** motivation, **my** persistence, to **your** beliefs, thus minimizing what I've done. I may be wrong and I'm open to change my point of view, but this is how I see it.I have to point out, I don't think 100% of what happens is imputable to one's personal effort or skills. I do believe there is *some* luck, I am aware about the influence of outside factors, but don't bring god in the equation, because when you do, personal effort instantly goes from having the biggest impact to being another factor in the lot, under the precious wisdom of your god.","In short, if you achieve something great and I think it's because of your hard work and determination, and you then try to tell me that it was because of some divine force, I'm going to be pissed."
"122","CMV: Life has no ultimate purpose","I have thought about the purpose of life a lot and come to the conclusion that life has no specific or universal purpose. Any purpose that we may ascribe to life will always be superficial and based on belief rather than rationale. Eventually we are just going to die and nothing will matter in the end. I earlier thought that the purpose of life is to be happy but no matter how hard you try, you cannot always be happy. There are going to be struggles in life. You can do everything right and then a life changing incident can hit you out of nowhere: like the death of a loved one and it’ll completely break you. You cannot in such a situation be happy. Also being happy for a prolonged period can also make you complacent. Pain and struggle in life is inevitable and to some extent even necessary for growth. Then I also thought that the purpose of life is to be a good person but the more I looked into it, the more I realised how subjective the idea of good/bad is. Every person may have their own individual purpose for life but those are just temporary goals they set for themselves. It is not ultimate or universal. Thus, life has no purpose.",".Similar to the concept of nihilism, this is a statement suggesting that life has no ultimate purpose, or meaning.CMV: Life has no ultimate purpose."

I am however saying you're not directly or efficiently helping by just not watching.  the only people's boycott that could make a major difference would be the workers (who should 1000% protest/unionize)but that goes into my other point, most issues listed are producer issues.as for the ""it could change a virgin's expectations"" I hold the belief that sex is both overvalued and undervalued, our expectations of sex is already messed up and watching porn didn't further that or decrease that. some think their first time is going to be magical while others think having sex can change your DNA.Sex expectations are already screwed, we should want more proper sex ed in schools to help dismantle these false ideas.* ps also make your own comment, don't just respond to an old comment of mine(or someone elses) as i might not see it.","There's nothing wrong with watching porn, as long as you're aware of the risks.

"124","CMV: Most people in the contemporary world are, deep down, agnostic or atheistic.","People in the contemporary world, especially those in ""developed"" nations, don't live like they truly believe that God exists.I'm not talking about people who believe in some God but who fail to follow some of their commandments, given humans' sinful nature.I'm talking that we have whole societal systems and structures that could only be built because people, deep down, do not believe that God exists, and systematically behave in accordance with that disbelief.You could think about the prevalence of the global pornography industry, for instance.Pretty much all major religion condemns pornography. Yet, today's pornography industry can only be as big and as permanent as it is because billions of people help to keep it alive:Billions of people watch porn, hundreds of thousands make porn, a lot of people pay for porn and, besides that, there is a very large number of people and industries providing the modern pornography industry the infrastructure it needs so that anyone with a smartphone anywhere can watch high-quality porn with minimum loading screens and a gigantic variety of content and tools to lead you to the videos you wanna see.This isn't about billions of people deeply fighting their urges to please God and failing. This is about billions of people not giving a shit to God because they don't believe in God.And of course, one may say that he or she believes in God but their God isn't against pornography or something. However, most people say they follow one of the major world religions, and pretty much all of us discover the concept of God by being taught in some of these religions. Then, what these people do is strip this religion of all its set rules and interpret it in a way that allows them to do whatever they feel like without feeling guilty.But that isn't coherent with believing that an omnipotent God created the world and sent a divine book. If you really believed there was a fucking omnipotent God creating rules you wouldn't read his/ her rule book with such vast interpretative freedom, for you would be fearing a freaking omnipotent being that could torment you to eternity.Besides that, all the Western world is secular. We analyze history from a secular perspective. We think Law from a secular perspective. If one really believed that their God created the world, would it make sense to behave like that? To analyze all of humanity's actions through the lens of materialism? To try to keep God out of political discourse?But I'm not talking about liberals only, because conservatives also don't behave like they truly believe in God. Even so-called religious conservatives. They only believe in God to the extent that is convenient to them. For they're also truly atheist deep down. Because if they truly believed in God, God would not only be used as a political means when he/she isn't even followed as a personal philosophy.","Yes."
"125","CMV: We don't need oral arguments before the US Supreme Court anymore because it's a sham and we know the votes will be along partisan lines.","The Supreme Court is quite partisan as of late, which is eroding the public's trust in it as an instutition. It should, in theory, focus on interpreting existing laws from the standpoints of legality and precedent. Oral arguments help the court understand whether a lower court reached an incorrect decsions, or whether the legislature overstepped its bounds. Lately, we see the court become far more partisan than it ought to be. Normally, justices will try to set aside personal beliefs and biases and do the job of interpreting law, instead of trying to force their own beliefs from the bench. I understand there are many different ways to interpret laws, and the Constitution. Original/founder's intent, modern, and strict textualism to name a few. I believe that is fine, valid, and necessary. Even though some may argue that we should not care what the Founders wanted 200+ years ago, many feel we should not deviate too far from the fundamental principles that are the foundation for this government. Having a justice with this perspective ensures these voices in the country are represented. Today, though, the court is almost entirely partisan and votes rarely change. Instead, justices practically ignore oral arguments, precedent, and their duty and instead try to force through their personal vision of what the law should be (i.e., they legislate from the bench). Based on what we saw with Justice Thomas and his wife, it is also somewhat corrupt and untrustworthy (I somehow doubt Thomas and his wife are the only ones engaging in this behavior, they're just the ones that got caught). We should do away with the pretense that the court cares about oral arguments and just skip that alltogether, so we can get to the point where they inevitably vote along party lines.","Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn"
"126","CMV: I shouldn't have to respect or thank the military at all."," I  used to be a pretty conservative person that believed that one should   always have respect for police and military personnel but 20 years of  the War on Terror brought me to adopt some pretty pacifistic beliefs.So   why should I respect military personnel for participating in something  I  don't believe in? I'm sure someone is going to bring up the current  war  in Ukraine so I will say that directly defending one's own country  from  a foreign invader or neighboring invader is one of the few  scenarios in  which I believe armed conflict is justified.I'm   American so I'm going to use the War on Terror as my main example. Why   should I respect someone who occupies foreign soil for an indefinite   amount of time with no clear exit strategy? Why should I respect a drone   pilot who mows down civilians based on bad intel? Why should I respect   someone who levels a building full of unarmed people or hostages? Why  do  I owe a debt of gratitude toward anyone who willingly participates  in  what I feel is an unjust military-industrial complex?A   common argument I've heard is that I should blame politicians and   leaders instead of military personnel and soldiers who don't have a   choice in the matter. I do very much blame politicians and there aren't   many options to vote for who have a genuine anti-war platform. In fact,   I've gotten very cynical about politics in general and feel that the   majority of politicians are careerists who only care about amassing   wealth. But military personnel are beholden to such politicians up to   the point that the president is considered the commander-in-chief. I   don't care who is sitting in the the White House, be they Bush, Obama,   Biden, or Trump, I don't owe them a duty of respect and they certainly   aren't my commander-in-chief.Also,   a common argument I've heard is that military personnel hate war and   neverending conflicts. Then why do you keep participating? Why does the   military hate whisteblowers? Why is it always whistleblowers and  leakers  who are punished instead of warmongering politicians? Why do we  reward  people like Donald Rumsfeld and Henry Kissinger and punish  people like  Edward Snowden and Bradley/Chelsea Manning?EDIT/UPDATE: So you guys got me to think along about the humanitarian and charity work the military does as well as search and rescue. I am grateful for that and understand that many people don't have a lot of options outside the military. However, I'm never going to support torture, black sites, or drone attacks. And there's still a part of me that feels that military personnel are pawns of men like Kissinger.","NM: I think a lot of people feel that way."
"127","CMV: Finding love on an online dating site can never be truly special and romantic","A big part of Romance is making the bond and connection feel special. There's a lot of Ego in dating, in the sense that you are saying ,""you are the only human for me. I care about you X amount."" There's also bonus excitement when love is found in an unexpected place or when you're not looking for it. In short, finding a partner has been a special experience for thousands and thousands of years. Online dating is not the authentic human experience of finding love. The fact that you are on the site implies that you are lonely and actively looking for someone to fill that role. How special can it be when you finally settle on one? Did they meet the bare minimum needs? Are you glad that you have someone instead of no one now?It also kind of implies that you don't have a lot of real life pursuers as well. If you had 10 to 12 people pursuing you that you had met from work, hobbies, life, and school... Well that's a lot to manage. You're sorting through them seeing what you like and don't like, the last thing you're doing is adding to the list by finding another five candidates online.Having a lot of real life pursuers is also part of what makes a relationship special. I had these 12 people but I chose YOU. Not ,"" I had zero options but I chose you."" These are the implications of online dating. I understand people are busy and not everybody has time to meet their match in an art gallery in Italy, or some movie-esque romantic encounter. I think online dating should be saved for short-term flings because of this inherent lack of romance. I'm open to hearing anecdotes about special online connections, that are truly romantic. I know plenty of people who are happily married from finding an online partner, but I still think it's weird and unauthentic.",",especially if you've never met in person."
"128","CMV: The US President should regain Line-item veto over every legislation, a power lost in 1998.",">Forty-four of the 50 U.S. states give their governors some form of line-item veto power, and U.S Presidents have been asking congress for such power for decades. Until 1996, when Clinton received it for two years. Shortly after, a 6–3 decision from SCOTUS found ""Line-item veto"" unconstitutional.Considering that SCOTUS has made wrong calls before, I am siding with the three judges who disagreed with removing this power. I believe that the President of the Republic should have the exclusive powers to veto bills, either in whole or in part. And that any provisions vetoed in such a manner are returned to congress and can be overridden by a vote.* Edit 2: **The reason for this idea come from stopping poison pills from being inserted into bills, forcing congress or the president to kill the whole thing**. This gives the president the power to remove bad sections put in the bills by either malice or stupidity.* If this is not overturned first by a future SCOTUS, an amendment would allow this veto power to return. Regardless of how likely this is to happen; I believe this would prevent bills from being full of ""pork"".Here is my proposal:1. A veto may be political, when the matter is considered contrary to the public interest; or legal, if understood as unconstitutional.2. As for the scope, it can be total or partial, and in the latter case it must cover the full text of an article, paragraph, item or subparagraph. That is, ""words or periods are not subject to a line-item-veto"".3. The President has fifteen working days to veto a text. After the publication of a veto, Congress triggers the constitutional period of 30 calendar days for the senators and house members to decide on the veto.4. A **4/7 of the votes** of both House members and Senators is needed for the veto to be overridden. Less than a super majority, more than a simple majority\*\**Edit 1: This used to read ""absolute majority or 2/3"". As this has been the bulk of the comments, I will adjust the matter to simple majority. This should fix the issues.**Edit 3: I still support the provision, but some claim that simple majority is now too lenient. Maybe the magic number lies in the middle. 4/7s of each chamber means that you need more than a simple majority, but less than an absolute majority.*","Yes, the US President should regain Line-item veto over every legislation. This power was lost in 1998, and it is an important tool for the President to use in order to ensure that important bills are not passed without his approval."
"129","CMV: Happiness is an overrated life goal","I’ve never really cared about happiness as a measure of life’s wellbeing, however recently I started to noticing that many people over glorify its’ importance as a truism. I’ve noticed plenty of articles, group discussions and polls trying to paint happiness as something to base owns own life decisions on. And I guess this is not new since I’ve come to learn even ancient philosophies are pretty defined by their answering how to live a happy life.Personally, I find this bemusing. Happiness is an unquantifiable emotional state which makes it a horrible metric to base one’s life decisions on. It’s too vague, precarious and unproductive to be a goal worth achieving. At best it should be seen as a by product of other endeavors, but not a goal in itself.People should base their major choices and goals on being productive or simply attaining virtues. These are much better goals because they are measurable and quantifiable. Being a productive worker, citizen, family man, role model, etc… any of these are superior to happiness.Therefore, my view is that happiness isn’t really a good goal or purpose to life and people drop it. And instead choose from plenty of the more preferable, actionable alternatives. Now change my view and tell me why I’m wrong!","CMV:Happiness is definitely a good goal, but it's not the only thing that matters in life.

"130","CMV: Pornography can be motivational for those who are ambitious.","Even though many people say that pornography ruins their motivation or something, the true fault for not feeling motivated relies on them, not on pornography per se.Because pornography can be seen as motivational fuel for self-improvement.I mean, when one watches pornography, he or she will see some outstandingly attractive individuals. Not all of them have pretty faces, but some of them are extremely pretty and outright model material.If a person who is attracted to these individuals sees them behind a screen and gets depressed and demotivated because he is just masturbating as he's never going to get someone that attractive IRL, the problem is inside this person.Because someone could see that same image and think ""wow, I want to be as hot as Liya Silver""! ""I want a girl that hot (but who isn't a pornstar) to desire me"" or even ""I want to have so much cash that I could hire all these pornstars for a party in my yacht!"".So pornography could motivate you to get active, to study, to work harder, to get creative, to become smarter (as it is an attractive trait), to become emotionally stable (as it is an attractive trait), etc.Because you're not gonna fuck a 9/10 by being a lazy poor couch potato with no friends.So, if you see pornography and instead of feeling motivated you feel like a loser and without strength to do anything, maybe that is on you.","There could be a few reasons why pornography could be motivational. For some, pornography could be seen as a way to achieve their goals in life. It could be a way to learn more about sex and how to perform sexually, which could then lead to better experiences in real life relationships. Additionally, pornography could provide an escape from reality for some people. They can watch and enjoy pornography without any real-life consequences, which can give them a sense of freedom and power. Finally, pornography could be motivational for those who are ambitious because it could help to increase their excitement and interest in sex. Watching pornography could increase the level of excitement and arousal that someone experiences in a real-life sexual encounter, which could lead to better and more enjoyable sexual experiences."
"131","CMV: As an Asian liberal I believe Western liberalism is shit","As someone from Asia; I have had experiences which made me realise that western liberals are stupid.

I have no idea how me owning houses is a rural part of India is driving up the real estate market but logic is not something which I find entitled jerks living with 30x higher per capita income than me are good at. And recently I got into an argument about a mod having a flair saying too based to be cis. Why is this allowed. Are cis people lesser than trans. I pointed out that saying the reverse would not be be funny and some asshat said that people like me lead to white power rallies because yeah brown people are responsible for the clan.I am all for trans rights, abortions, free medical and whatnot. Hell we have all of that already here. Though some of them need improvement we try to get it done. Equal rights that should be the end goal. However what I see in the western liberal movement is to right people not having equal rights by making them some sort of special class of citizens.Edit: I see a lot of comments saying that I am just assuming based of 2 incidents; I am not. I just posted the most recent 2 I encountered. Edit2: By saying I don’t agree with western liberal policies don’t mean I agree with your conservative ones. I just see the chances of my country men becoming gun lovers extremely small.

"132","CMV: The Letter Grading System in colleges should be replaced with the Raw Percentage Grade, at least when calculating the GPA.","A few problems with Letter Grading:1. It gives students labels and those who received an F would face heavier stigma than those who recieving a ""59"" for example, because F directly means ""failure"".2. The intervals are sometimes too wide. In Japan it's often as wide as 10 points. So Letter grading leads to students calculating how many points they need to cross the cutting point. Some people who can have a good estimate of their score and know their mid-exam scores would think like ""I'm gonna recieve a B no matter what, if I study it's 88, if I don't it's 82, so better recieve the 82 and slack"" and slack instead of study. When I was in the 1st and 2nd grade of college, I was a great score controller and recieved a great deal of 91s, 92s and 86s. (90 and 85 were cutting points in my college but in some Japanese ones there are only 90/80/70/60, a 89 and a 80 would be the same), slacked in courses I knew I would receive a 90+ (and an A/A-, both 4.0 GPA) and somewhat gave up on those I know I would only get a B+ or B (3.6/3.3). 3. It can sometimes make bad students look good. In my case I have a fairly high GPA but the vast majority of my 4.0s are made up of 92. So students who receive 97s and 100s in some courses and 78s in others may seem worse than me, but there is a HUGE I mean Huge gap between 92 and 100. It's simply unfair for the more ""unbalanced"" students. 4. Similarly it can make good students look bad. Not only the unbalanced ones but also the unlucky ones who would recieve a 89 or 79 or whatever-9 in many courses. 5. Letter grading has lost its original meaning because of grade inflation. B no longer means ""good"", it's ""barely acceptable"" for many. On the other hands, in some specific conditions (such as a course with a very low median score), a C might mean ""super good"". 6. In cases where curve grading or adjustment of scores is needed, teachers can just adjust the raw percentage without having to care about the cutoff lines for grades, saving a lot of additional work and potential 89/79/69 pointers pleaing to the teacher.7. Finally, as a minor benefit, abolishing the letter grading would avoid making students who recieve a 89/79/69 feel frustrated.","I completely agree. I think the GPA should be based on Raw Percentage Grade instead of the letter grading system currently in place. This way, students would be more accurately reflecting their performance in college classes."
"133","CMV: Drugs should remain banned in countries with little or no drug problem, such as China or Japan","Edi: I'm talking about recreational not medical drugs. Medical drugs should be legalized.  The US and the West only legalised some soft drugs like Marijuana because they could not ban them effectively. They lost their War on Drugs. However, in China or Japan where almost no one does drugs, suddenly legalising them would artificially create a whole drug problem for us to deal with. So why not just keep them banned and avoid the trouble of having to deal with a big drug-influenced population? We don't have a big drug problem anyways. I live in China. I have never known anyone who consumes, possesses or sells illegal drugs in real life. The proportion of drug users in the worst drug-influenced province, Yunnan, is below 1%. According to the government, ""As of the end of 2021, there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide with a year-on-year decrease of 17.5%, 3.4 million people who didn't relapse for more than three years after withdrawal, an increase of 13.4% year-on-year"".

[https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug](https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug) If we legalise Marijuana, there might be more hard drug users and more alcohol addicts also. Again, marijuana while it's soft, is harmful in itself. We'd rather have a population free from marijuana than a population heavily influenced by it.Not to mention hard drugs like cocaine or heroin.

"134","cmv: The believe in women needed to be covered in islam stems of misogyny","I must first clarify that I do consider the culture and religion of Islam to be more cult like in structure and enforcement , I also hold this belief towards Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses, etc. I have never once heard an argument as to why Muslim people believe their prophet and god orders modesty from women and very little on men. Whenever I ask this question I get a "" because he said so"" response. I think this is an obvious cop out response because they have no other arguments, why does one think the human body of a female should be hidden more than a  man. they're different kinds of veils however none of which would be used for a man as regardless to which one the male would have more skin/hair exposed. Women also will lust at the sight of men so they should be veiled as well but they are not. I think the idea of this is because women are supposed to be less sex driven than men and as a hyper sexual female I know very well this isn't true. Also I don't believe there is a state of modesty that doesn't involve other people as the concept of modesty is a social construct in itself, so the woman is not doing it for herself if she believes it's from her religion. Not even going to mention how modesty has nothing to do with preventing rape as many people will use as a reason. A person who wishes to take someone's will and control them will simply not be warded off by clothes. In addition to all of the previous statements having loose articles of clothing such as a full body veil is very dangerous and restricting as I see women covered in swimming pools or on rollercoasters. Amusement park workers are too afraid of being accused as Islamophobic than prioritizing their safety as clearly stated on most amusement park rides. The pools also include dangerous parts which could suck a woman in by her veil and not release allowing her to drown. I really am searching for a response from a person who veils or knows people who veil under the islamic religion. I am damn near begging for someone to inform me on this topic.","This statement is misleading. Islam is not inherently misogynistic. Many Muslims believe in the rights of women and believe that they should be treated equally to men. However, there is a large faction of Muslims who believe that women should be confined to the home and should not be allowed to participate in many aspects of society. This view is referred to as ""misogyny"" and is considered to be antithetical to the Islamic principle of egalitarianism."

It's like putting original A-1 on my ribs smothered in sweet baby rays.Everyone knows pizza is American (yes Italians, it's ours now, too late) and my hypothesis is that domino's (or pizza hut or whatever) opened up in China and they want to make it feel super Americanized, so they offer ketchup. The unsuspecting and innocently curious Chinese try it out, and figure ""when in rome!"" and drizzle it with ketchup. I married into a Chinese family, and my FIL thinks cheese and all the things about pizza are gross - so adding ketchup? Little difference.Then the trend continued and now zillions of otherwise decent people are corrupted by this abomination of a food mixture! Shame on Domino's (or whoever). They've led these good people into darkness....CMVEdit for clarity: focus on a standard pepperoni pizza from a chain.","Dominos is evil because they sell Ketchup on Pizza. This is an abomination because it is not part of the pizza tradition in Asia."
"136","CMV: Most Administrators in Healthcare/Education are Useless (*in USA)","I was considering making this about administrators in general, but I figured I'd narrow it down to healthcare and education to make my point concise.Here are some graphs I've found on google images.[https://images.app.goo.gl/v24sSYqwv5Ecs9rE7](https://images.app.goo.gl/v24sSYqwv5Ecs9rE7)This graph shows the insane growth of healthcare administrators to doctors since the 1990's.[https://costofcollege.wordpress.com/2014/05/30/public-schools-administrative-bloat/](https://costofcollege.wordpress.com/2014/05/30/public-schools-administrative-bloat/)The graph here shows that the amount of administrators in public K-12 from 1970-2012 has increased by 138%, compared to 60% growth for teachers and only 8% growth for students.I chose these examples as some examples, but so-called ""administrative bloat"" in healthcare and education in pure numbers has been studied widely and there is no shortage of data in this regard if you want to look deeper.**How is it possible we need this many more administrators?***My current view is that we don't*. That most of these administrators have useless jobs which could be eliminated without any negative effect.Even if we do need more administrators proportionally to the past to enforce certain new ""good"" rules, the sheer growth *seems* unjustifiable.So what are they doing all day?My guess would be they are creating and enforcing meaningless procedures, engaged in repetitive meetings, and the like.Sure, there are important things we need administrators for, my point is that most of what they do now isn't important.*Point here is to avoid semantics:* My point doesn't imply that most administrators do nothing useful. It could be that for the average administrator 25% of their work is necessary, and that only 5% do absolutely zero useful work. This wouldn't disprove my point that less (likely far less than 50%) of administrators are de facto useless/unnecessary.I haven't heard any argument justifying this so-called ""administrative bloat"" but considering hundreds of thousands if not millions of people work in these type of jobs and environment and there seems to be no meaningful political effort to reduce the number of administrators out there; there must be some sort of justification, and I am curious to see what that is and see if it changes my view :)","I'm not sure where you're getting this information from, but most health and education administrators in the United States are not useless.

"137","CMV: Binance Smart Chain is not a real blockchain.","I am having a debate with my CEO of why we shouldn't launch on Binance Smart Chain. I believe BSC doesn't support the true image of what a public blockchain is. For starters, BSC is heavily centralized, its validators network is only comprised of the 21 top holders of BNB and updated daily. Some other blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, avalanche and others have more than 40k validators globally.Second, BSC's ecosystem is lesser developed than other blockchain ecosystem's such as Ethereum and Polygon. Infrastructure tools and backing is essential to fostering connections and partnerships within the web3 ecosystem. When you look at DeFillama, the top projects on BSC are meaningless (this is my opinion): you got Pancake Swap that holds over 50% of the TVL in BSC (they have 2.8B whereas the total value locked in BSC is 4.4b.Third, having gone to various crypto events, I have always felt a seperation between Binance native crypto projects and other decentralized protocols such as Ethereum/polygon/avalanche... Binance for me has a great backing but experiments little with pushing the limits of innovation and testing out new features. Every new product added to their platform has been a fork of DeFi product (Binance Earn, Binance Staking...). Projects being native in Binance don't look to push the limits rather they want to benefit from the huge backing Binance has and its connections.Lastly, the image projects have when deploying on decentralized protocols is enhanced compared to the one that would be of deploying on a centralized protocol. Nobody (IMHO) wants to associated with centralisation rather they want to show that they are building new things, taking part in partnerships with other decentralized protocols.I am currently in a debate with my CEO and am building a case on why not Binance Smart Chain and more Polygon. If you think I am wrong, please explain why and if you agree also.

All five sleep in King size beds in home (170 cm or wider). 4 of them said they feel the dorm bed is too cramped. All five say they feel more comfortable sleeping at home than in dorm. Two of them said the influence of smaller bed size is ""severe"". **edit** view changed. It's more of a sleeping habit problem Bed size was quantified in the 18 and 19 th centuries when people were far shorter than before.

In China, the standard size of a bed for one person is already 120~130 *200 cm, so why use these claustrophobic small beds in collective settings?Space is not a problem, just make large bunk beds if needed. Also, there have been examples of bunk beds being wider than 90 cm so mechanical strength shouldn't be a problem either.In the end, I think a national standard should be made that a bed for adults should not be narrower than 120 cm unless specifically required (in settings that REALLY value space like trains, spaceships etc.)","This is a good suggestion.

"139","CMV: The origin of COVID-19 is uncertain","I think people are reflexively against the lab-leak hypothesis because it seems more conspiratorial, but are too over-confident in dismissing it. People need to take a Bayesian approach to this question. The origin of COVID-19 was three years ago, and subject to two layers of coverups - once by local Wuhan officials hiding their failures in Dec 2019, and then later by the Chinese central government. To summarize US government agency positions from this [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-origin-china-lab-leak-807b7b0a): FBI thinks lab leak w/ ""moderate confidence""DOE thinks lab leak w/ ""low confidence""CIA and another Unnamed agency is undecided between two theoriesNational Intelligence Council + four unnamed agencies thinks animal transmission w/ ""low confidence""The agencies at most moderately confident and they are split. In terms of publicly available information:In favor of animal transmission:* Animal transmission is historically where all diseases came from In favor of lab leak:* There is a lab in Wuhan where it could have come from, and they were working in the area of coronaviruses* There have been many cases of [lab leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laboratory_biosecurity_incidents) in the past (and since!)* Labs are a new invention compared to the entire history of human-animal interactions, so history isn't the best judge* There has yet to be a clearly established animal link unlike other novel diseases (like SARS or MERS)*  The disease predates the outbreak at the [wet market](https://www.science.org/content/article/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally), weakening the animal leak. Notice how the arguments in favor of lab leak are mostly rebuttals to the idea that it is definitely animal transmission, but aren't definitive themselves either. The Chinese government suppressed scientists trying to raise the alarm of covid existing. They've since resisted making investigation of the origin of COVID easy. I think they don't want any evidence of their initial poor handling (in December of 2019) of covid to come to light, or the possibility of a lab leak to come to light (I would guess they also don't know conclusively either). The coverup doesn't mean it is a lab leak - there are non-lab leak reasons for the Chinese coverup, it just means we can't know for sure. The information available to us as the public don't point definitely one way or another. The US government, which has experts and also spies etc also don't point definitely one way or another. There is a good chance we never know for sure. We shouldn't dismiss lab leak as a conspiracy theory.

"140","CMV: I believe that practically every pro-choice argument when it comes to abortion also applies to assisted suicide, and I don't understand how you can support one without the other.","To clarify: I am pro-choice and pro assisted suicide. Though this argument also applies the other way around.When I talk about assisted suicide I mean specifically the process for a person to be euthanased medically by professionals, and that it should be legal and available for almost anyone barring some limitations (more on that later).This all thing started with the recent laws in Canada for assisted suicide, which let people to end their lives even if they don't have a terminal illness (I don't know the intrecate details of the law and it's not very relevant).I've seen plenty of people arguing that this law is basically a genocide of poor people.The idea is that a lot of people who would choose to go through that because of their material conditions, would not have if they had the money for a better life - maybe better medical treatment or better living situation, etc.And that by giving people this option, the government is saying that it rathers to get rid of poor people instead of improving their lives.What strikes me about this, is that the exact same thing could be said about abortions - how many of them happened because a person wanted to have a baby but couldn't support it financially? Or couldn't afford to be pregnant?I think people are aware of these cases, but still accept them in effort to reduce suffering and in the name of bodily autonomy.And the more I think about it, every single argument for abortion also applies to assisted suicide:- it might end a life, but bodily autonomy takes precedence.- People don't sign in to being pregnant, just as they don't do for life. It's ok for whoever wants to continue, but forcing it on people who will suffer for it and want to quit is cruel- It might hurt people around them but the person who controls the body gets to make the choiceYou get the idea.I do think there should be some limitations.Obviously late abortions are rarer and have different conditions and I think that's agreeable by almost everyone.And being pro choice means presenting all the options, including abortion and letting the person choose when informed.So I believe the same for assisted suicide - we should have alternatives and some limitations (age, maybe a waiting period as it is not time sensitive as an abortion), but still be generally available as an option.Why is this CMV?We'll, honestly I feel like I'm missing a big piece of it.I see people talking about assisted suicide like it's so obviously wrong that I think there must be something that I'm not seeing.Since this subject is taboo arguments about it are rare and I feel like I haven't seen the other side's points fully.","It's true that pro-choice arguments also apply to assisted suicide. Both are forms of medical assistance in ending a life. It's also true that there are some significant differences between the two. Abortion is typically viewed as terminating a pregnancy, while assisted suicide is usually viewed as terminating a person's life."
"141","CMV: Answering your own questions while talking is annoying and provides nothing to the conversation.","Lately, I've been noticing this awful trend in conversation where people will ask themselves really easy questions and answer them with a yes or no. I hate it. I don't want to hate it because a lot of people I respect, like the professors I learn from, do it. But I can't see the value in it and it's annoying to hear. We'd just be having a normal conversation, and then out of nowhere, monologue rapid fire easy self-answering questions: A: So what are your thoughts on the pileup on the highway? B1: I mean do I think the driver could've been paying more attention? Yes. Do I think I'll be more careful driving from now on after seeing how bad it gets? Yes. Do I think that someone did it on purpose? No. Example of saying the exact same thing:B2: The driver could've been paying more attention. Think I'll be more careful driving, seeing how bad it gets. Don't think he did it on purpose. It's so much shorter, more efficient, and says everything that B1 said.

"142","CMV: We could just as easily say ""oneteen"" instead of ""eleven.""","**Edit**: My view is almost completely changed. That was fast. Now I know that ""oneteen"" doesn't make sense because the pattern of numbers in the teens is ordinal number - last sound + teen, so even if I wanted eleven to fit into the pattern it would be ""firsteen,"" not ""oneteen."" I also know now that eleven is a strange number in several languages because, in part, of the rate at which it's used compared to other numbers. Partly, too, numbers below twelve have a unique naming system compared to those after 12 because 12 is such a unique number in division. So, I no longer think that ""oneteen"" is pretty much the same as ""eleven."" This isn't the most sophisticated thought in the world, but we could just as easily say ""oneteen."" It's fewer syllables than ""eleven"" and it follows the pattern of other 10s, except ""twelve"" but obviously I think we could say ""twoteen"" if we really wanted to. The only other language I know is Spanish, and their word for ""eleven"" is more in line with the rest of their tens column.There's no huge benefit to it, on balance. It might make counting past ten a little bit more intuitive for children (that's what triggered the thought), but I don't know that they struggle all that much with it. I mostly just think, linguistically, it would make just as much sense if the English language evolved to say ""oneteen."" It's a little bit awkward to have the ""ne"" but we do that for ""nineteen"" and people get a long just fine.I'm not even saying we should change it, so this is a super narrow CMV.

"143","CMV: Tyra Banks yelling at Tiffany was completely uncalled for.","We're referring to the only memorable moment that people who don't watch *America's Next Top Model* remember the show for.**""I was rooting for you, we were ALL ROOTING FOR YOU, HOW DARE YOU?""**That moment.Anyway, I decided to watch that whole season and do some research. Tiffany had auditioned for the season prior, but failed to make the final cut due to failed psych evaluations and getting into a bar fight.Tyra put Tiffany through anger management. Tiffany came back and made the final cut. She was ELATED, and shared a story about how her grandmother deferred paying her electric bill, let her lights go out, so she could buy Tiffany a swimsuit for the competition.Just watching the season in general, I could tell that towards (and during) that final episode, I could tell Tiffany sort of gave up. The teleprompter reading challenge, where Tiffany was saying ""I can't read this"" I could tell she was defeated, and Tyra and her panel did not help.Eventually, Tiffany was eliminated. Tiffany didn't cry when she was told she was out. She was laughing and hugging and shit. She was being a good sport and taking it in stride. I would be proud of her too. Apparently, Tyra wasn't. She called Tiffany and Rebecca (the other girl eliminated) praising Rebecca for showing emotion after losing, then launching her attack at Tiffany, how it was a joke to her, how her grandmom got her lights shut off, talking about anger management. Tiffany tried defending herself, before Tyra eventually flips out on her. Tyra was upset at Tiffany's attitude and not trying. If she really cared about it, she would have done this speech BEFORE she was eliminated instead of after when it didn't matter.A lot of that stuff was just...wrong and uncalled for. IT was uncalled for of her to scream at her and tell her to ""be quiet.""""When my mother yelled like this it's because she loved me""Funny. When my mom yelled at me the way you yelled at Tiffany, it was because she was pissed off at me. And also, you are not her mother.You come off trying real hard to be Mother Theresa, but in reality she's just a cunt for doing that.","This is not a good look for Tyra Banks, and she should be ashamed of herself.

"144","CMV: if generative AI (in its current state) is making things that could replace your art, then your art is simply not very good","I’m definitely sensitive to the fact that AI images could be used in fraudulent ways, and I get the concern that in the long run this technology could take away artist jobs.But frankly, just looking at the images currently rendered by MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, etc… I mean, they’re really COOL for sure, but artistically speaking? They’re not good. At worst, you’ve got mangled hands and facial features and so on. At best, you have a scene that totally lacks personality and dynamicism and intelligent composition. Like those “such and such movie as an 80’s dark-sci-fi film” pictures — really impressive detail and realism, but no life. The characters are stock-still and expressionless. Many have their backs turned. There’s no implied movement. Just… these are not choices any halfway-decent artist would ever make.So I just have a hard time totally sympathizing with artists who treat this as an immediate threat. Like… either your art should look better than this or you shouldn’t expect to earn awards or money for it, in the first place. In any case, if your art looks like this, it’s mediocre at best. As a creative type myself, I’m still mystified by the “I worked hard on this so I deserve x y and z.” Because that’s just not how it works.This even extends to the questionable matter of how these AI are trained. Some artists have come forward alleging their art was used to train AI without their knowledge or consent. I can sympathize to an extent but ok… first of all they probably signed something without reading it first. Same is true for most of us who post OC online, I’d imagine. Still your responsibility tho! Gotta live with the consequences. But aside from that… like it just feels to me like a sort of cynical opportunistic move to try and win royalties on some generic art-school schlock that didn’t have much if any monetary potential to begin with. So I dunno, I feel like a bit of an asshole saying this but frankly, I’d care way more about this if I felt the artwork “at risk” here was actually like, good enough to be culturally significant in any way. I think it’s inevitable that one day AI will make art just as good if not better than humans, but until AI can either possess or understand human emotions, I think that day is a long way off. Plus, whenever a digital artist uses generative AI as one of many tools in their creative process, producing original work, the results are LIGHTYEARS ahead of any of these pure-AI renders. Meaning that a) this is real art, it’s not being “cheapened” by the artist’s choice of creative media, and b) instead of complaining about AI “replacing” us, we could just use it to level up our work and stay ahead of the automation stuff. So I just can’t really see what the issue is. Seems to me like a bow that ties itself.","This question is asking whether or not generative AI can create art that can be considered as good as the art that is currently available. This is a difficult question to answer, as different people might value different things in art. Some people might think that art should depict realistic scenes and characters, while others might appreciate abstract art. It is also difficult to say what qualities make an artist good, as this is subjective. If we were to look at some of the most famous artists in history, it is likely that many of their works would be classed as 'good' by some people, but would be considered mediocre by others. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide whether or not they think the art produced by generative AI is good."
"145","CMV: Abortion is justified in the first trimester in the cases of rape. Even if Personhood starts at conception.","I should preface this by saying that I am pro-life.However as I've continued to debate the pro-life argument I have been stumped on rape cases.Now I do wanna state my mind on abortion as a whole is not really going to change and nor is that really what this CMV is about.For the purpose of this CMV. There are my viewpoints.- Human Life starts at conception- Personhood is discrimination (This is my viewpoint of personhood but essentially the idea here is to disregard it entirely. For this CMV you can assume it starts at conception)- Consent to sex is Consent to pregnancy (I am actually not so sure about the statement itself being correct but the idea here is that consensual sex is taking responsibility for your actions. I am only mentioning this to showcase the difference between rape cases and consensual cases. Because you can't choose to not feed your child your responsible for)- Body Autonomy does not give you the right to murder other human beings.As for Body Autonomy argument this is where I'm not so sure if banning abortions is logically consistent to that argument of rape casesThere is an abortifacient that can allow women to not provide nutrients to her baby. In which case that to me is similar to the Violinist argument. That you can unplug. To those who aren't aware the violinist argument is that you are kidnapped and connected to the violinist. You are the only one who can donate resources to the violinist. However this is not forever. You are only stuck for 9 months. Many people that you have the right to unplug. Now whether or not you will is irrelevant to the point that the government cannot interfere with said situation. Even if you unplug with the intention of wanting to kill the violinist you will still be allowed to unplug. It would be unethical but again not really the point. So the argument typically falls down (in my belief that's why I'm asking here) is whether or not its active killing or passive killing.The argument I've seen is that you are attacking its environment with the abortifacient hence its active killing. But this does not convince me. It is just a he said she said scenario. A pro-lifer will tell me its active killing and a pro-choicer will tell me its passive killing. This is not necessarily the argument I'm stuck on you can give me a different argument. But I'm simply pointing out this is one of the arguments.","Abortion is justified in the first trimester in the cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.

I didn’t mean to upset a lot of people.///I have seen too-many-to-count of these type of videos. It really upsets me. In America, at least, there is talk of possibly going into one of the worst recessions ever and people are just casually making videos that are just wasting food. Most of the time it is in very big quantities. I see people making insanely huge salads in their sinks. I see people doing things on purpose just for the rage effect when prepping food. Half the time it is not something edible at the end, the other half it is edible but the ingredients they used were so outlandish and ridiculous that you would not want to eat it for any amount of money. We are in a reality where a dozen eggs is now $10 in places. Simple ingredients are something that minimum wage people can’t afford anymore. No joke. 90% of the time the people who make these videos, it is obvious that they are well off. Their kitchen, utensils, and everything that you can see are pretty expensive and not cheap. They have money and the views they get from the videos makes their pockets even bigger so they could care less. There is no point to these type of videos and honestly it enrages me every time I see one. I understand it is for entertainment value, but I believe this is not that. It is a blatant show of wastefulness and the people need to be stopped. I think their must be a way to find these people and issue them a fine or in extreme cases serve some jail time. Please help me CMV so I don’t get filled with rage Everytime I see them and I can maybe understand it more bc I’m not seeing it.","There is no justification for intentionally making food-based videos that are designed to elicit anger, frustration, or ridicule from viewers.

"147","CMV: There are inherently people who are more valuable to society than others, and the most fair way for society to function is to treat these groups differently.","This may sound harsh but I don’t think I’m wrong to say this but there are some people who simply cannot benefit society in the ways others can mostly due to intelligence. For example take me, I am a software developer who works for a medical technology company. I attended a good university on a full ride, and was able to get this job almost straight out of college. The work I do helps people and will for years to come. Unfortunately not everyone can do this. Luckily there are jobs they can do.Fast food, retail, construction, etc. Things that someone of my intelligence would be wasted on, however are still necessary for a functioning society. The thing is, these jobs are nowhere near as necessary as my job. My job is nowhere near as necessary as a doctors. It would be unfair to offer the same benefits that they receive to me.So these people working these lesser jobs shouldn’t be making enough to rival what I make. Like let’s be real, in my current position I make 65k a year, should a person flipping burgers at McDonalds make that much money for their labor? Of course not.

A perspective from a physically disabled person","I am specifically referring to the idea that people claiming that someone thinking that a disability is something wrong with someone is ableist. That is the literal definition of a disability. A non-ability to do something caused by either an error in the genetic makeup of a person or due to an injury rendering someone unable to do something a ""normal"" person can do. I'll use myself as an example. I am paraplegic. I have Spina Bifida at the T-10 level. I cannot walk and am confined to a wheelchair. Therefore, I, not having the ability to walk like an able-bodied person, have something that makes me able to do less and therefore I have something wrong with my physical body that is preventing this. That is just a fact. It's not discriminatory to point that out, at least not to me. There is a physical deformity (a deformity being, by definition, something that is not formed correctly) in my spine that is preventing me from doing something someone without that physical deformity can do. This is at least my view, as someone who lives with it. I'm open to hearing other perspectives as to why it may bother some people.EDIT: I realize I may have misunderstood what true ableism is as I have not faced it personally in my everyday life. I was referring to what many people tout as ableism online as my definition of ableism. I do see how the discrimination factor would be true ableism, but I have seen so many people get up in arms for people just acknowledging the fact that someone is disabled and calling it ableism.","Yes, I believe that the concept of ableism is a non-issue in modern society.

This is also based on American transit and design (I will be talking a lot about stroads)&#x200B;The following are my opinions on traffic and public transportation:Traffic on suburban streets (and sprawl in general) I will be using Los Angeles suburbs as my example. The first problem with public transportation is with suburbs, low-density single family homes with large driveways and large streets. [LA is notorious for traffic, both on freeways and stroads](https://escholarship.org/content/qt1ms960x0/qt1ms960x0_noSplash_02bd8fa23242861e5c91dde859cc53ca.pdf?t=mnighi). A large amount of LA traffic happens in the suburbs around freeways, in low density neighborhoods. Transit can't work in these suburbs because only a low number amount of homes will be accessible to stops and stations within a reasonable walkshed.  Furthermore, only a fraction of people living near these stops and stations will actually utilize transit. Most people will still drive to places. Americans love driving. In fact, [only 16% of Americans ](https://time.com/3005148/energy-cars-driving-gas-poll/)[prefer transit.](https://time.com/3005148/energy-cars-driving-gas-poll/) And [73% of Americans prefer long-haul road trips over flying](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/a27555453/americans-prefer-road-trip-over-flying-travel/). This ties into my first point of people driving, in low-density and even high density neighborhoods, Americans don't like transit and if even presented with the option, people will drive. In low density neighborhoods especially, it makes more sense to people to drive because most likely your destination is not within walking distance, and cars are fast. (During off-peak times especially) And ""people don't want to share space with the stinky public, they prefer the car where its much better"". /hjNIMBYs (Not In My Back Yard) People who are worried about transit affecting their everyday lives. ""I would love a new metro line! Just, not near my house"" . And since American neighborhoods are already built, that would mean tearing down houses, and people give the government such a hard time when eminent domain comes into play. For example, NYC has a housing problem that they would like to fix with TOD (transit-oriented development) and TOF (transit-oriented future) [but a lot of these plans wont work because of NIMBYs](https://buildingtheskyline.org/tod-nyc/). These people are blocking projects that could help the flow of traffic, but they want it somewhere else.I'm not going to go into costs, largely because a lot of transit authorities operate at a loss and that doesn't seem to affect new plans, and because they are sometimes government funded."," congestionPublic transport can't solve traffic congestion. The best way to reduce congestion is to improve the overall economy, which will lead to more people working and travelling."
"150","CMV: Occam's Razor is a Fallacy","More precisely: The use of Occam's Razor as an argument is fallacious.I make this distinction because it seems like it was originally intended to be just a rule of thumb, but in practice it has been stretched beyond it's usefulness to exhibit some inherent truth of the world.  I'll break down the interpretations I've seen, but I'm open to more.* ""When presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should prefer the one that requires fewest assumptions.""  This seems like the most reasonable interpretation, but it is useless in arguments because people are using their assumptions to come to different conclusions.  If they agreed on the conclusion, I could see it's usefulness in eliminating unnecessary assumptions.* ""Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity.""  I feel like this one isn't saying anything of substance.  You can tell someone to not do what isn't necessary, but if they're doing it, it's probably because they think it's necessary.  It says nothing about where necessity lies.* ""The simplest explanation is usually the best one.""  This one actually says something and is the one I've seen in arguments.  However, it's used the same way an appeal to tradition or an appeal to nature might be used.  It's assumes that simplicity is good and complexity is bad without attempting to prove that.  In reality, the world is very complex and, in my opinion, to favor simpler explanations is either lazy or deceitful.  Just because something is simpler doesn't make it truer.Examples:I often see this appeal to simplicity in these two arguments, one of which I'm sympathetic to, the other I disagree with.  The first is the antitheist argument against the existence of a god.  From what I understand according to antitheists the existence of god is an unnecessary complication of reality and should be rejected, but it seems to me like the existence of god is the simplest explanation for anything.  Where an antitheist would have to describe quantum mechanics, the existence of the fundamental forces, the big bang, etc., the only explanation a theist would have to provide for any phenomenon is ""God wills it.""The second is the anti-trans or gender critical argument.  These people conflate sex and gender and favor of the idea that a man or woman is just an adult human male/female over a model of gender that takes into account physical sex, gender roles, presentation/expression, and gender identity.  They choose to stick with the simpler ideology despite the fact that it doesn't encapsulate the variance in humans.","The principle of Occam's Razor states that the simplest explanation is usually the best one. This principle should not be used as a guideline to eliminate all possible explanations, but rather should be used to prioritize explanations."
"151","CMV: Technology will 'solve' philosophy","Some here may believe philosophy is an ongoing process from ignorance to truth done by man or machine. Fine, I am not here to twist arms.But approaching an achievement like solving philosophy we could find first all the smallest objects of reasoning, then combine them in - all - combinations with each other, and therefore find all possible logical results.Assuming materialism this might be the most fundamental particles. Maybe the building block is monist. If we then combine them often enough (and set an arbitrarily limit to size) then the number of combinations are limited, so it is possible to find all of them. As our computation ability grows, so does our ability to expand that size limit. Who'd do this? If we are materialist, and there is nothing special to our intelligence, then why can't we mass produce it? The intellect to do this thinking may already be the information technology we have and are developing. If we then could export that volume of philosophical data to each philosophy abled animal then wouldn't that eliminate the need to be learning it yourself? If we are not materialist, then we can conceptualise one or a few fundamental building blocks then combine them en masse. Here we'd need to specify their size again to prevent the number of combinations to be infinite.Therefore, I depend on some assumptions, but wouldn't this be a great achievement of philosophy?------- EditI'll rephrase to say we can find all information that we label as philosophical. I want to say all information that can exist, but we can limit our aim a bit.","“Technology will solve philosophy,” proclaimed one respondent.“We will see a merger of the two disciplines in the next decade,” said another.“I don’t see how technology can ever truly solve philosophical problems,” declared a third."
"152","CMV: There’s no reason for me to ever have children","One of the great hallmarks of many people’s lives is having children… so much so that you’re unpopular for not wanting any.I’ve always hardlined the opinion that I do not want children, and I cannot rationalize it for any reason. I can see why other people want it (but again, their reason is just that *they want them.*) They’re loud, expensive, messy, and will prevent me from completing my goals in life. One argument at a time: - They’re LOUD and high-maintenance. Waking up at 3 AM because your baby is crying for 2 years in a row sounds like a nightmare, especially when you have to wake up for work the next morning. This is not to mention that for the first 5 years, you basically can’t leave them alone, and for the 7 years after that you’re grounded where you are and very limited in what you can actually do, and your freedoms, because uprooting them would damage their development. - Suddenly your life as a parent becomes about your children. You have to wake up an hour early to get them dressed, cook for them, take them to school, then spend extra time to take them to extracurriculars, do their laundry, read to them, help them with their homework, bathe them depending on their age, etc. It’s a job before and after your job… you’ll be lucky to get an hour of free time on weekdays. Then you’re also on the hook for them on weekends. You have to plan your vacations around them.  - They’re **expensive**. It’s estimated that children on average cost $310k for the first 18 years of their life. In the search to give my child a better QOL, I would most certainly shell out more for them. How can I rationalize having a child, especially in this economy? $100K combined as a DINK is an extremely comfortable lifestyle. $100k combined with children is miserable. If my goal in life is to travel the world, how could I seek to have children while also not losing that which makes me happy in life, unless I can guarantee myself a well-paying job? Not to mention the aforementioned concerns that I’d have to be bolted down for my child. My goals in life are to enjoy myself and travel… to amass knowledge in all corners of the world, to become comfortable and live a comfortable life. Not to mention climate change, a fragile economy, and high prices making the child’s life far harder than it would have been in, say, the 80s.For these reasons, I don’t think that having a child would ever make sense.

"153","cmv: ""Don't consciously try to date, just let it happen"" is bad dating advice for all, and even more so for the lower two thirds in attractiveness of body and personality.","I (m,28,hetero) have gotten the above advice three times in conversations about my dating life. Always from  women that were not unattractive. My intuitive reaction is to dismiss it, because I assume that the people in question are unaware of the fact that, broadly speaking, in a guy's dating life there isn't much happening without conscious effort - unless he just so happens to have a job or hobby with  eligible people and is willing to date within job- or hobby community. I assume they believe that I would get approached with a high-enough frequency - as they do. I suspect they may be unaware of the special circumstances that women above a certain attractiveness have. But I want to stay open-minded and ask: What mechanism would make it so, that not consciously trying to find a long-term partner is an advantage? Or in other words, how does the act of consciously dating sabotage the process? My personal dating philosophy is mostly that you ought to do serious internal work and be very conscious and effortful about the process - the belief that intuition and luck will get you a really good partner will make you end up following bad emotional impulses and short-term decision-making. To begin with, I could imagine that when you do not consciously try, there is less projection. I'd love to hear stories from your dating life to illustrate your points.","There are a lot of things wrong with this advice, but one of the most important is that it's bad for everyone, regardless of attractiveness. This is because people who are lower in attractiveness (or any other quality) are more likely to face discrimination and harassment when dating.This type of advice also gives people lower on the attractiveness scale a false impression that they don't need to work hard to find a partner and that they're not worth pursuing. This can lead to more disappointment and frustration when dating does happen, as well as more difficulty finding a partner in the future."
"154","CMV: The importance of muscularity in men with regards to dating is wildly understated","I don't believe that enough people, especially women and older individuals, particularly understand how important muscularity is in regards to dating.To clarify, I don't mean being fat vs. being not fat. I mean specifically average, even healthy, men are at a SIGNIFICANT disadvantage in comparison to muscular men.While the ""chad"" archetype is showcased all the time in media, many people often attempt to dismiss this especially in an attempt to appear less shallow. I don't think I've heard a single woman ever mention muscularity being important to whether or not they like a man but the evidence says entirely otherwise.Pretty much almost every single time someone mentions muscularity in regards to dating, there's always someone else talking about how everyone has different ""preferences."" While obviously not all women are the same, it's still pretty darn easy to find what appeals to the vast majority of them. There have been countless studies done that pretty much almost unanimously showcases women preferring muscular men to non-muscular men.Furthermore, pretty much every single muscular guy I've spoken to talked about how his dating/sex life got entirely transformed after getting buff. Most of these guys would go from struggling to even land a single date to women basically giving them their number at random to the point where they basically don't even have to try to pick up women anymore.Sure, you can say that these muscular men are more confident than non-muscular men which is definitely a factor, but in today's age where people literally judge dating partners off of slides on their smartphone, it's pretty obvious that physical appearance is tremendously helpful to finding a romantic partner than ever before (especially with how isolated we are becoming).I genuinely believe that any man who struggles with dating or doesn't have many female friends really needs to turn lifting into a hobby in order to find a partner. It's also critical to start as early as possible because people don't realize how slow building muscle really is.Edit: I am getting asked to back up my claims so I'll just link [this](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.1819) and [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/12/12/women-rate-the-strongest-men-as-the-most-attractive-study-finds/?utm_term=.c1bf51f1f3e4).I didn't really bother linking anything because genuinely almost every single thing I came across from one Google search had the same thing lol.Edit 2: I think I need to clarify how muscular I'm talking. I don't generally mean the meathead who benches 400 lbs. I mean the guy who is noticeably muscular and is more like your average gym bro. Big arms and shoulders but not super jacked.","I think that muscularity is definitely important when it comes to dating. It can show that a man is confident and has a strong sense of self.

Idc what u been through anything, at the end of the day if u make stupid decisions obviously bad things will happen in turn. Don't be a crackhead Legalizing drugs has a big impact on preventing gang violence. Most street feuds are based off drugs that are stolen, and since you can't contact the police to help you you have to get it back through violence, which in turn will escalate to full out beef that will take the lives of many innocents as well as criminals. If drugs are legal, instead you could just contact the police and they'd get your narcotics for you without violence being involved. The main counter argument is that it would sky rocket drug use. Idk if you don't go outside but anybody above the age of 10 with access to a phone can find a dealer within 30 minutes. Dealers are already in abundance.

Also, Buttercup is the one to blame for her descent into a life of villainy."," Original PPG 1998 series.If Princess *really* wanted to be a PPG, she would have tried to learn how to fight crime effectively. It's not like her resources are as finite as the next guy. She easily could have used money to learn.Instead, it's pretty clear she wanted the glory that the PPG had. She was jealous that everyone loved them. She wanted to be loved and to be the center of attention just like they were, but didn't want to work towards it, because, let's be honest, she got everything she wanted just for the taking and not for the working.Part of the blame is on her parents, who never had the gonads and strife to say no to her. The PPG saying ""no you can't be one of us"" was probably the first time in her entire life she was ever told ""no,"" and she stayed very bitter about that to the point where it drove her to a life of villainy.Being rejected, I don't think was what drove her to be a villain. Rather, it was Buttercup's hostile response to her wanting to be a PPG kind of added to her bitterness.In her debut episode, ""Stuck up, up and away,"" Blossom was diplomatic and tried to explain to her nicely, ""you don't have superpowers and you're not cut out for this,"" whereas Buttercup was more like ""no you can't be one of us, and fuck you for even asking,"" even coming close to hitting Princess on two occasions just for wanting to be a PPG (only to be stopped by Blossom and her diplomacy) and when she finally did throw punches, she got thrashed (like she deserved to be, tbh)In a later episode, ""Bought and Scold,"" we see Daddy Morbucks buy Townsville for Princess, making her the Mayor.

To put the PPG out of business purely out of spite.If she REALLY wanted to be a PPG like she claimed, she'd use her authority as Mayor to sign a decree making her a PPG, which makes the most sense.","Buttercup is the one who pushed Morbucks to become a Powerpuff Girl, and then lectured her on the importance of being a good role model.

"158","cmv: Women are too sexual AND they are also not respected enough.","So, let me explain. I am against the current oversexualization of women and yet I also disagree with the usual other side of the argument. I look right and I see feminists (usually women) claiming that women being sexual like this is strong, empowering and beautiful.I look left and I see (usually men) saying that when women express their sexual self outwardly in any way, they are less valuable. It is not always being said as directly and clearly as this, but it is often implied in indirect comments. Wether it’s about OF, women having multiple current or past sexual partners, clothing, dances, pictures, social media, etc.Both are feeding off of each other and making the other more an more extreme. Both, in my opinion, are wrong.(Disclaimer: I will be generalizing for the sake of the argument and being efficient): Men consume media of women being sexual. They are strongly attracted to them, and yet they also do not respect them for it. They’re porn watchers. And yet some of them will harshly judge women working in the sex industry, using only fans, or even just being sexy in general. Hate them, spit on them, laugh at them. I remember when that one porn star, Lana Rhoades I think, announced that she was pregnant. It’s like men could not grasp the sole concept of a sexual woman doing something… human? I’ve never seen any drama when the men porn stars have kids. The women they want to date, the one they see as the respectable ones, the less outwardly sexual they are, the better she is. Madonna-whore complex.It makes women sexualize themselves even more. First because, well, there is a public and it pays, A LOT, but also because I believe they want to prove the point that women should be allowed to be sexual and still be considered as respectable HUMANS. Therefore, they are not trying to hide their sexual self anymore and maybe exposing it a little too much as a protest.  Which isn’t wrong, but it transformed into an oversexualization that is so so detrimental. Today, it feels like just the word woman implies sex, for both men and women. Sure, being sexual can be empowering, but it stops being empowering when it is the only power you have and the most important one as a woman. Just look at male vs female celebrities, singers, artists, clothing, advertisement, media, movies, sexual harassment, how little underage girls on tiktok are trying to be sexy. Women around us are people that have ambitions, passions, active roles in society, complex inner world and free will. And they are sexual. Sex is an aspect of their lives but it should not be the first thing they are and it does not define them. Basically, kind of like, men.Thanks if you read this whole thing. I seriously want other people’s insights.","This is a difficult one to unpack because there are so many aspects to it. On the one hand, women are sexual and should be allowed to express themselves sexually in the same way as men. On the other hand, women are not usually respected as much as men and this can be a barrier to their full and equal participation in society."
"159","Cmv: Political assassinations should be legalized as a way to protect the rights of an individual from exploitation by politicians","Okay, politicans such as those in elected and appointed offices often get away with abuses of power because they view themselves as untouchable. So why not make sure that political assassination by the common man against any poltician is legalized as a final safeguard with all elected and appointed governmental officals forfieting their rights for protection under the law (that also means no hiring bodyguards until you complete your term or resign) , allowing for anyone to kill them for any reason at all?  This would prevent the common man from being exploited as those elected officals will have to consider their policies carefully to lower their chances of death and make sure they fear for their lives while considering policy and drafting laws, allowing the individual to have a final redress if all methods that do not end with the death of a elected or appointed governmental offical fails.Make it such that those elected and appointed governmental officals  remember this. They are our slaves whose job is to keep the government and the infrastructure running. We, the governed have the right to dispose of them in any ways possible, by hook or by crook if they displease us.Edit: Okay, that blew up. Thanks for your views  on why political assassinations should not be legalized",".There is some sense in which this statement is true - proponents of legalization would argue that anyone who commits an assassination is doing so without the full knowledge and consent of the victim, and so should be considered an illegitimate actor. This removes the power of the assassin to determine the course of a political life, and allows for an open and democratic political process. However, there are a number of significant problems with this line of thinking.First and foremost, legalizing political assassinations would legitimize an act that is, by definition, illegal. Whilst it is conceivable that a legalized system would make assassinations more difficult to carry out, this would not solve the underlying problem of why assassination is an ethically problematic act in the first place. If anything, legitimizing assassination would give criminals a pat on the back, signalling to them that assassination is an acceptable way to achieve their goals.Second, legalized assassination would create a powerful incentive for politicians to protect themselves from assassination. If assassination is seen as a legitimate means of political retribution, politicians will be hesitant to cross swords with their opponents, as doing so could lead to them being targeted for assassination. This would lead to a weak and compromised political system, in which the interests of the powerful are allowed to supersede the interests of the average citizen.Finally, it is not clear that legalizing assassination would actually lead to a decrease in the number of political assassinations. Whilst it is possible that criminals would be deterred from carrying out assassinations if they knew that they could be caught and punished, it is also possible that they would simply turn to other methods of carrying out their schemes. In short, legalizing political assassinations would not solve the problems associated with this type of crime, but would in fact add to them."
"160","CMV: Lend Lease to the Soviet Union during WWII was a massive mistake","I believe that lend lease to the USSR was a massive mistake that led directly to the cold war and all the issues associated with it. It allowed the USSR to conquer and subjugate eastern Europe and Manchuria and allowed them to prop up communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe, China and North Korea.To change my view you'd have to convince me that 1. The soviet union would have completely collapsed and fallen to the Nazis if not for lend lease aid. And/or 2. The rapid and success Soviet offensives of 1944 and 1945 would have been possible without lend lease aid. Bonus 3. There were not any better uses of that aid.1. My argument is that the USSR wouldn't have collapsed if lend lease didn't occur. In 1941, the USSR had very little aid given to it yet they held the Nazi offensive off. Leningrad, Stalingrad and Moscow all were not taken. And even if they were taken sometime during 1942 or 1943, the Germans would have still had to expend massive resources doing it and it still wouldn't have ended the war. The soviets would have just retreated further back into Russia, extending German supply lines even more and waging even more guerilla warfare. 2. The supply of vitals materials like trucks, rubber, high octane oil, boots, ammunitions, planes etc. were essential for the success of an offensive. A defensive war could still have been wages without them, but a offensive war - impossible. Without the 400,000 trucks given to them by the US, there's absolutely no way the soviets advance to Berlin before the US does. If the USSR is still bogged down in Russia in 1944, or even 1945, that gives the US time to either advance up through the balkans and liberate eastern europe or go right for Berlin and end the war but secure the independence of eastern europe in the peace settlement. 3. There were other uses of this aid. The US could've used this aid to build even larger American armies or better equip the British or free French. The massive British colonial empire could've been equipped and put into the field against the germans (to an even larger degree than it was). Foodstuffs could have been given alleviate the Bengal famine. Nationalist China could've also been given much more equipment which would've made their position against the Chinese communists much stronger. Without lend lease to the USSR, we might have seen a free and independent Eastern Europe, a non-communist China and a free and united Korea. The USSR would have been significantly weakened without all the supplies from lend lease and the industrial equipped looted from East Germany post war, and they would've been completely unable to compete with the west economically or militarily, ushering in an era of peace.","While Lend Lease may have helped the Soviet Union during World War II, it was a massive mistake on the United States' part. The program allowed the Soviets to build up their military at a much faster rate, which ultimately led to their victory."
"161","CMV: CRT technology should be brought back, albeit in forms that cater to modern graphics and flat screens.","I remember back in the late 90s towards the mid 2000s that CRT and cable tv were pretty much commonplace in the United States and other developed countries. In those years of having being brought up in the world of CRTs', I've realized two things: 1.) authenticity to the sound quality | 2.) a lot less delay in motion pictures for video games and tv shows.I know I'm sounding a bit unscientific here, but I just feel like there was a lot more ""soul"" to the games I've played and to the shows I've watched on CRTs. It felt like every single moment was truly valuable while sitting on my couch. By comparison, watching things and playing games on LED and LCDs feel so soulless/inauthentic that I truly don't feel like I'm living in the moment when viewing those kinds of newer screens. I've done some research on why I feel this way, and there are actual legitimate explanations as to why this is the case. For my first aforementioned point about the sound, it turns out that CRTs used analog technology to produce sound, which made voices and sound effects have an almost vinyl-quality to them. With regard to less input lag, which is my second point, certain motions and actions performed in video games and shows had this almost buttery smooth feel to them.It's hard to deny the many positives that CRT tech had to offer at the time, and I really do feel like the abandonment of such technology came at the cost of lower quality picture and sound. I really to believe CRT tech should be incorporated in a way that allows the tv to handle the very top of the line graphics of movies and video games of today. I believe this feat is quite possible if only CRT hardware could somehow be minimized and fit into flat screens.Do y'all agree with my view that CRT tech should be brought back to restore the ""soul"" of television? Or   is there another way to bring back that kind of authenticity? And moreover, is it even possible to minimize and improve CRT tech so that the flat screen TV surround it can handle modern AAA title games and big budget movies?  I'm open to any insights and other avenues, especially from those who actually have expertise in these sorts of things?","I believe that CRT technology should be brought back, albeit in forms that cater to modern graphics and flat screens. With the ever-growing popularity of mobile devices and gaming consoles, CRT technology lends itself well to providing a more immersive experience. For example, CRT monitors are still used in many gaming consoles, providing a sharper picture than their LCD counterparts. Additionally, CRT monitors are still commonly used in older computers, as they provide a more traditional desktop experience.While CRT technology has its disadvantages, such as the bulky nature of monitors and the susceptibility to dust and scratches, I believe that its unique features make it an essential part of the computer experience."
"162","CMV: People who claim to hate NFTs then proceed to buy rare cosmetics for games are hypocrites.","It is quite literally the same exact system. It’s a piece of (usually bad) art/fashion that only exists online. The only difference between the two is that one is used for a video game and the other is used for online spaces. I don’t think should have to explain why NFTs are awful, it’s a topic that has been torn to shreds by every single journalist, commentator, and news outlet on the face of the earth. However, I will say that video game companies are doing the exact same thing as them and people still buy their products. It’s not like they aren’t scummy as well (loot boxes, exorbitant prices, etc.), and yet people will buy these things while also shifting on the online version of this stuff.It’s not as bad, but still pretty awful when it’s more decentralized like Steam or Roblox and players can also sell their own cosmetics, which is its own can of worms in terms of awful stuff. Much like NFTs, there’s a bunch of market manipulation, money-grubbing scams, and other such toxicity. It’s literally just a more centralized version of crypto/NFTs. I don’t know how anyone could see otherwise.I’m not saying people *aren’t* complaining about it, because plenty of people are. But unlike NFTs, they still continue to buy them. Its as much as a fundamentally scummy system as NFTs yet people still buy them despite all the complaints, I just don’t get why. Can anyone explain?","It's not hypocrisy, it's just that these are niche products and not things everyone needs. If someone truly hates NFTs, they would boycott all games that use them."
"163","CMV: Money has more power to influence our elections and public policy than voting.","Corporations earn billions of dollars every year compared to the rest of the working population. If they want to make a problem go away or change public policy to deregulate their industry, all they have to do is pay out enough money to make it happen. No amount of votes will change the public policy the people will want because corporations will simply rinse and repeat the same strategy for anyone who tries to regulate them through lobbying and campaign financing. They have so much influence on every stage of our democratic institutions from the elections to drafting the laws. The last few months have shown the impact of the decisions our democratic institutions have made leading up to what we’ve seen in the Ohio disaster. It simply shows that no one in government actually cares about the people and it’s all a popularity contest to them and what they’re willing to sacrifice to keep most of us happy or at worst passive about those decisions. The electoral system we have is so well designed (in a bad way) that practically all the cards are stacked against the people who vote, which is why change will never happen or happen at a pace that represents the will of the people. I realize that I referenced the Ohio disaster, but I feel this isn’t only an American problem. In Canada, we have an oligopoly on our telecommunication services and it’s practically impossible to regulate them to give us affordable internet and cell phone prices, and enable competition in the market (CRTC always hires some former executive of one of the telecom companies).","False."
"164","CMV: The Liberal Arts/Humanities are Dying Out, as is Academia","I've always loved the humanities/arts and currently work as a teacher with the intent of potentially going into academia in the future (to become a professor or researcher). That being said, what I see happening in higher education right now, and the liberal arts, is nothing short of the goddamn apocalypse, and it has really dissuaded me from going and getting a Master's in the subject I intend to teach (English/Writing), despite encouragement from my mentors, former teachers, and family members.Everything from the declining enrollment of humanities/arts grads, to the pitiful wages of adjunct professors compared to their massive student debt balances, to their mistreatment and exploitation, to the ever increasing competition between individuals for a shrinking pool of available jobs, to the near-impossibility of gaining tenure, to the lackluster ROI for grad degrees and especially PhDs, makes studying the humanities at the graduate level effectively a dead end. A fool's errand.I adore the arts and humanities, and even went to art school to pursue my passions, but at some point reality hits and you have to put food on the table. I made one BIG mistake not focusing on $$$ in my undergrad years, and I don't want to make that same mistake again. Going into academia simply isn't worth it anymore, let alone studying the humanities/arts. The field is declining, if not already dead. Best alternative I got is becoming an entrepreneur or learning things on my own online.For fuck's sake people barely read or want to read anymore and all the money/prestige is in industry, because under capitalism, industry and R & D produce things of tangible economic value whereas academia is mostly theory with very little direct application, hence its lower economic value despite its higher subjective value for some people who appreciate the non-tangible benefits.AI is also creeping up on academia and the arts, and seems to be the final death blow, but then again I could be wrong.","False."
"165","CMV: Forcing binary genders unto society is mental abuse, much like forcing religion unto a teen mind. A non-binary society should be the norm in our culture for our healthy coexistence","Gender is mannerisms, tone of voice, choice of attitude, attire, the way you behave.Being soft spoken, wearing a dress, using makeup is a social construct. Let's agree we are advanced apes. Let's agree that for millions of years, in a family dynamic, we've needed to look for food, take care of our offspring, and love each other to survive.That's all we are. We are made up of two biological SEXES. That is one has XY chromosomes, the other has XX chromosomes, and that's what makes an offspring occur. For millions of years, this dynamic has been compromised of two hunters and gatherers, protectors, nurturers. Both needing to act like savages for the survival of the family.Dresses, makeup, tone of voice, the way someone sways their body as they walk, was made up by society. Music choice, your facial expressions were made up by our society. Over time, there was a distinct binary separation that seemed to be along the lines of: ooga booga (chest stomp) I am MALE and then oooh I'm a dainty FEMALE because biologically one has bigger and stronger attributes which LED to adapting the typical binary attitudes. Culturally this became the norm and in our current ""civilized"" society we impart this attitudes towards our offspring out of tradition, and when somone steps out of line of this MADE UP expectations, society shuns these people and shames them.BUT GUESS WHAT. Some people said...wait. I can express myself however I want. Biologically I am not SUPPOSED to speak softly, or be submissive or be alpha or anything. We are individuals that are born with sexual organs that do not dictate behaviors. People realized that hey...I can be ""girly"" if I want to (as an XY chromosome being). I can wear baggy pants as a biological female. It's made up and people are starting to express themselves in ways which aren't traditional because we aren't confined in a box, especially a box dictated by ourrrr PAsToR or teH socieTY. We are individuals that can have families and be kind with our neighbors without dictating how I prefer them to act.Forcing genders unto people that aren't comfortable following that grid, is much like forcing a lion in a cage at a zoo, limiting their ability to fully express themselves.

"166","CMV: Pay discrimination within entertainment is not bad","I’ll preface this with saying discrimination based on race or characteristics of the person is unacceptable. The way I am using pay discrimination is based on how value an actor, athlete, musician, etc can create and not based on their “group” (women getting paid less than men for similar jobs).The main reason why I don’t see pay discrimination as bad in entertainment is because it’s hard for me to see any of these fields as being replaceable or identical. Take three actors; Tom Cruise, Scarlet Johannsen, Morgan Freeman, each commands a big paycheck whenever they step onto the screen. I don’t Imagine anyone would say they are not worth their value for their respective movies, but are their co-stars paid the same level? I can’t imagine they are even if they have the same screen time. Harrison Ford got paid much more than his costars in the Last Jedi despite having a fraction of the screen time. Reason being they are paying for what he done previously, and directly for what he is doing on the screen in that particular movie.For movies I see the value that a big name actor brings to the screen being a more guaranteed way for a movie/TV show to make money. People are more likely to see a show with an actor they already know than something with someone they don’t. This means the pay discrimination that people face in the movie/TV industry is more based on how well you are know and how much audience you can make to see a project.For the music industry I think it’s much more direct, you make money off of how many people listen to your work. I think it’s almost harder to find prevalent bias in the music landscape, apart from the bad deals artists sign as they are trying to blow up.To change my view I am looking for some kind of evidence that there is an underlying bias in some field of entertainment that cannot be chalked up to people trying to predict success/failure that results in a group of people being paid less.","There are a lot of different types of entertainment, so it is hard to generalize. However, discrimination within entertainment is not bad. This is because entertainment is a activity that people enjoy and can be enjoyed by people of all races and genders. Discrimination within entertainment can lead to a less enjoyable experience for the people who are being discriminated against, and can also lead to a less diverse and inclusive community."
"167","CMV: It's possible to pass a massive, progressive economic reform package that would appeal to the GOP","I have in mind something like the following, which would be all part of one package:1. No minimum wage2. Personal taxes are simply a set %-age of wages. No deductions3. Poverty rate calculations are done annually and regionally adjusted4. All adults receive a livable, regionally adjusted, non-taxable universal income at 2x the regional (not national) poverty rate. These dollars would not be attachable for any debts, fines, fees, or other purposes by any party.5. Everyone gets untaxed, universal health care with guaranteed full coverage6. Get rid of all other monetary welfare and food assistance programs, social security, and medicare/Medicaid7. Eliminate VA medical benefits and roll them into #5My thoughts are that some of the typical GOP complaints are valid. SSN benefits aren't keeping up with inflation and can't be made to based on the way it's structured, for example. And maintaining multiple insurance programs for veterans and the elderly is duplicative and wasteful.I also am on board with the idea that if a company wants to hire someone for $0.25 an hour, and they can find someone who wants to work for that much money, then that should be a transaction between those two parties. The reason we have a minimum wage is to prevent businesses from exploiting workers. But if workers don't have to work to survive, then it will be more of the case of businesses being allowed to price their labor based on the value it produces and what the labor market demands for that worker.We can get to an effectively flat tax structure for wages, eliminate a lot of complexity in tax structures, and thus reduce administrative costs at the IRS for taxes for average people, freeing them up to examine taxes related to businesses and business owners more closely.At the same time, we can ensure people have enough money to survive, making them not dependent upon their job to address their basic needs. They'd have medical coverage and care, eliminating medical-expense-induced bankruptcies and the need for so many people to work while sick or ill.While I don't think we'd ever see something like this brought forward since both parties would freak out at the idea of their shibboleths being touched, I think a package like this could pass should it be brought forward. Because it addresses needs across multiple demographic groups and interests.  The exact details are flexible (maybe it needs to be 2.5x the regional poverty rate for UBI for example) but the overall idea is that every gets something important to them, and overall costs (public and private combined) likely go down. "," and increase the budget deficit by trillions of dollarsIt is possible to pass a massive, progressive economic reform package that would appeal to the GOP and increase the budget deficit by trillions of dollars. However, this would require a significant shift in how Washington operates, and it's far from certain that lawmakers will be willing to make such a radical change. In the real world, it's often difficult to bring about large-scale change in a short period of time, and it's unlikely that Congress will be able to approve a massive economic reform package in the near future."

Rather, it is a hate sub. Which Reddit admins have set a documented precedent in banning:FatPeopleHateThe \_DonaldScores of openly to racist/homophobic subsI have two main points about what makes this sub so toxic: that they are a hate sub; and that they are moral grandstanding instead of actually trying to make some sort of valid pointTo my first point, I believe the front page of that sub at any given time speaks for itself - they post articles to anyone supporting, playing, or even discussing Hogwarts: Legacy and not completely insisting on boycotting as being transphobic and tacitly or times overtly endorsing hating on them. No if, ands or bits - if you bought the game, you hate all members of the trans community. Worse if you just reviewed/streamed it, you're anti-trans - the controversy with Girlfriend reviews and the current state of the sub shows that they are not above using bullying tactics to make their point. To me, and their completely unapologetic nature about it, demonstrates this sub is a hate sub.My second point is that the sub is actually just moral grandstanding, meaning they are making their argument as a way to as easily as possible state their philosophical beliefs without having to do the work or actually supporting them.You know what I haven't seen at this sub, like at all, during this time of controversy? Links to LGBTQ or pro-trans issue charities or NPOs. Or links to how to volunteer and help the LGBTQ, or even just the trans, communities. Really, to my knowledge the sub has not supported or discussed any ways to actually benefit any members of the LGBTQ community other than ""post mean -spirited memes and yell at ppl who disagree with you online"". Plus, the sub is collectively incredibly morally absolute - who either hate everyone who buys, plays, or discusses the game in any even remotely positive light, or you're transphobic.For these reasons, I genuinely don't mind labels this sub as a hate group and that I should be banned.","No."

To be clear, I am not using its answers, I'm doing my work and then seeing if it can do it too after. I really wonder if people who think it's the end of the world have ever actually tried using it for anything in practice. I am taking a geological science class, and anything past 5th-grade problems it gets COMPLETELY wrong. Basic math word problems? completely wrong. Basically anything too complicated for wolfram alpha it gets wrong. Cant do my partner's intro to college math class problems either. Cant do basic physics problems and I have to check/iterate 2-3 times for anything related to programming, and anything outside of leetcode examples or stuff easily googleable, it cant do either. It's even worse because it has no concept of right and wrong; so its VERY confidant. If you dont already know how to do the problem, and thus can check its answer, it's basically completely useless. It's a cool program, dont get me wrong, and I could absolutely see it disrupting industries like blog writing or other regurgitative media (copywriting, etc) but other than that...actually trying to practically use AI into my workflow has been an insanely dis-enchanting experience The main thing I see people say is ""it got this good this quickly, imagine where itll be in 10 years!""..but people said this about self driving cars 10 years ago, and look where we are now.

"170","CMV: The American government in response to Covid should have made a big effort to get our country back in Shape","The largest comorbidities for covid and many other life threatening ailments are blood pressure, obesity and general fitness. While some folks took Covid as a wake up call to take back control of their health and fitness, for the vast majority of people, America’s response to Covid with strict lockdowns only resulted in furthering our obesity/health crisis in America. I believe we would be much better off both during Covid and in the long term if instead of Covid alarmism and keeping people locked up indoors, a concerted effort was made to get Americans in shape. Imagine if proper guidance and financial incentives / assistance were provided to able bodied folks to get outdoors, join gyms or similar programs, lose weight, and eat healthier.[El Salvador’s Covid ad](https://youtu.be/bzGP45A4TRU) is an example of the type of messaging we should have pushed.While this wouldn’t be an overnight fix, the downstream effects could be immense. Life expectancy and work productivity would increase while we would alleviate the greatest stresses on our healthcare system and decrease rates of cancer, cardiovascular issues, depression, and much more.Edit: I should clarify my view a bit. I’m not suggesting the government should not have implemented pandemic measures like social distancing and masking but rather that Covid should have been a wake up call for all America to regain some semblance of health and fitness. Also I’m not suggesting anybody should be forced to do anything but rather that assistance, guidance, and incentives would be great ways to push for this and would have countless downstream benefits in the long term.","It is up to the government to take care of itself.

"171","CMV: Involuntary Hospitalisation of people with mental health problems simply because of suicide risks is wrong","Edit edit: ***completely changed view, the problem isn't involuntary commitment itself, its the poor condition like terrible food and mediocre sanitary conditions, and inhumane treatment like tying patients to beds for a long time, also treating patients like prisoners without dignity. We can make mental hospitals better places by correcting these faults. Then I would be even glad to be in one. Reform on the current system, not revolutionary deinstitutionalization is the answer. Can anyone change me back?*** Edit: ***Partly changed my view, people in immediate danger of suicide should be hospitalised, but still think involuntary hospitalisation should be restricted to when it's really necessary, and it's unfair that some people get locked into the same ward for years or even decades*** I was hospitalised in May 2022 because of ""suicide risk"". They literally treated patients like subhumans inside. The room was damp and grey, semi-dirty, no colours, no phones allowed, horrible food, I barely ate anything cuz the food was plain bad, and whoever dares to resist is tied to their beds for hours or days on end. If you are a newcomer (first 7 days) you have to obtain permission even to go to the toilet. I feel that the environment in mental health psych wards was worsening, not improving my mental health. Also, all the Bipolar and Depression patients are lumped into the same ward so I as a mild case was thrown together with literal lunatics. I couldn't even fall asleep at night because some crazy guy would yell-read the Holy Bible all night. (Funny, I sang the Internationale in response lol) Also, many patients especially elderly ones are literally abandoned by their children and basically had to stay there forever, they're driven mad by all this condition. One patient never stepped out of the hospital for 34 years, another 31 years and they both seem good people who behave just a little weird. So patients who only pose a risk to themselves and not others should not be compulsorily hospitalised and should be able to get out if the hospital on their own (and their families) discretion. Even if they are hospitalised, they should be given more freedoms, instead of being forced to stay in a jail for months or even years.","Yes, involuntary hospitalisation of people with mental health problems simply because of suicide risks is wrong.

"172","cmv: Some people and countries have less culture than others","The definition of cultured from cambridge dictionary: educated in and familiar with literature, art, music, etc.A person who just listens to the shark song all day has less culture than someone who listens to the shark song and a whole new world all day. It takes time and effort to read widely, watch lots of films from different genres, etc, etc.You can also argue that some countries have less culture, especially in countries where there is censorship which reduces the variety of art that can be found elsewhere (though propaganda machines can make sure there is the same quantity). There's a lot of other things involved and it varies over time but some countries produce more and better art than others at different times. My parents tell me that when they were young everybody could play an instrument and there were lots of local bands writing their own songs that would play most weekends. There are still some but it's not like that anymore (here). I would argue that means that we are less musically cultured now than in that time (comparing britain in the 70's to now).Objectively there's nothing wrong with having less culture, I just think that it makes life more interesting.I didn't think this was controversial but I got downvoted for it.&#x200B;Edit: View changed, I had having more culture being synonymous with being more cultured which apparently isn't how the english language works. I guess I need to try and reframe my thinking. When I go travelling I definitely have thought some places have more culture than others. I know what I mean and I'm pretty sure others would too but maybe it's just a case of being more specific because culture is so all-encompassing.","This is a difficult statement to evaluate.

"173","CMV: Genetic therapy and cybernetic implants (like Neuralink) should never be used for enhancing humans who are perfectly fine, and should be very strictly controlled (like how the defense industry is regulated) for all applications","EDIT: By ""never be used"", I don't mean ""ban"", but ""should be viewed as morally bad, and not used"". I should have written it so that I wasn't implying it should be banned.EDIT: All the points have been refuted, but if you have an argument that is *not* similar to any of the arguments that have already been made, feel free to comment here.By ""perfectly fine"", I mean ""able to live life properly without any help, does not have any medical disabilities, and having all their senses working properly"".The problems I see are:1. These will be expensive, and lower-class people and people in poorer countries will not be able to afford these. As a consequence, richer people will have an even greater advantage in traits like intelligence and physical potential (to become a sportsperson)2. If such services are used on young children to give them skills suited for whatever their parent wants them to be (for example, a parent could improve the kid's intelligence if they want the kid to land in an Ivy League), it will be effectively set up the kid for a more competitive childhood instead of a more relaxed one (which can lead to burnout and mental health issues), plus, it sets more pressure on the child to follow what the parent wants them to become instead of what the child wants to become (mental health issues again)3. If such services are provided by a company which messes up something or deliberately does something sloppy (due to cost-cutting), it could have much worse problems. Imagine a quadriplegic who uses an implant to be able to become a pilot, and his implant suddenly fails mid-air.4. Neural implants can lead to privacy issues (imagine a stalker using his implants to identify different things associated with his victim, like her favourite type of flowers, or to zoom in on her room from afar), and could be hacked and lead to worse outcomes (like someone forcing people to receive and view horrible visual content or controlling their limbs to cause harm)"," so as not to cause any unforeseen consequences."
"174","CMV: If communities were setup like ancient tribes, there would be no poverty. I can explain...","Modern society has been setup incorrectly.It's almost as if communities are setup like little businesses, entities where people travel from near or far to move into, and pay to rent/own properties that are managed by folks who most of time don't even live locally to the property. People travel miles into the city to get to work, or telecommunicate hundreds of miles for a paycheck. Some of us work for large corporations that employ thousands nationwide, that have boom and bust cycles of employment; dishelving thousands of families. We eat hormone-induced food grown hundred of miles away and sold in large conglomerate food institutions; farmed by almost enslaved culture groups on peanut-low wages for hard work.Everything about today is on a macro-level. We live in a society where everything is essentially outsourced; from food, work, entertainment, home/auto repairs, beauty/health, education, and so on.Specialization of work is ok, as it allows folks to focus on one thing and do it well. The only problem is it makes you more replaceable and essentially a cog in the machinery that can easily be replaced with a backup (or cheaper backup at that). Hence, why pay wages haven't keep foot with inflation and why we have so many employment issues domestically. **My Thesis is simple:** let's shrink the scale at which we operate, and go back to small village style of subsistence living where everything is made or produced for the few hundred living there. Need car repairs? Go to your local auto small business. Need fresh fruit? Billy Bob down the street got your back! If we supported folks directly instead of through large businesses that scalp talent and skill for wages, people could better support themselves and we wouldn't have macro-economic struggle.Thoughts?","There would be no poverty because communities would be setup like ancient tribes. Dinosaurs and primitive humans were living together before the advent of money, so it would be very similar to how communities are setup today. Members of the community would contribute goods and services to help each other and live in harmony. There would be no need for money since everyone would be exchanging goods and services without it.

"175","CMV: All shooter video games should have mechanisms to combat camping","Edit: by camping I mean ""base camping"" ie sitting still in the back, not actively engaging with the enemy but rather staring at the screen and waiting for them to come. Warfare in real life is defensive in nature. The defending side always have an advantage. In video games even more because there is usually a randomly-generated ""team"" that are poorly coordinated if at all. If it's all ""natural"" then camping would become the best strategy for any single player because if you decide to attack, your team mates are likely to sit back and watch and shoot at the targets you discovered from a safe distance, while you get farmed and die. It's kinda like a prisoner's dilemma in the game that I play, World of Tanks.If you camp and your teammate camp, both lose fun, and both have average stats.If you camp and your teammate rush, you get excellent stats and have a bit fun.If you rush and your teammate camp, you die quickly, no fun at all and no stats.If you rush and your teammate rush, you have fun and some good stats but usually not spectacular.For almost every situation, camping is the choice of  a well-informed, selfish individual playing normal types of tanks (not a light tank or arty). Thus 70% of the games reach stalemate where it's boring damage trading or even ""static"" where everyone is sitting still and NO ONE SHOOTS AT NO ONE. Before the balance is broken because a few guys grow impatient and decide to rush and die. Then the defending side, now superior in manpower, can defeat the originally attacking side. Sometimes the timer just expires and the battle ends up in a draw.In conclusion video games should combat camping by shrinking the battle zone, introducing new mechanisms like a special ammo to lit the battlefield up, respawn mechanism to decrease the penalty of dying, or higher rewards for aggressive gameplay that doesn't bring good stats but good win rate.","There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to combat camping in shooter video games will vary depending on the specific game. However, some effective methods of combating camping in shooter video games could include adding mechanics that make camping difficult or punishing players who camp excessively."
"176","CMV: public transport can’t compete with the convenience and reliability of cars","As someone who can’t drive due to a medical issue and who lives in a country that has very decent public transport, and who uses that very frequently to get around I  think that Cars are still the most convenient way for the majority of people to travel.They are just so much more flexible, oftentimes, people will talk about the speeds of various trains, but this is usually Station to Station and doesn’t take into account the time it takes to get to the station in the first place, and then the time it takes to get from the station to your final destination so using the train can take much longer., Plus, the spoke and hub design of most public transport systems, while efficient, means that it takes longer to get to towns and cities which are close by because you have to travel 1st to a central hub and then onto your final destination.Also, public transport has to follow certain designated routes, the train can’t follow a different path if there is an obstruction on the line but has to wait until it’s cleared and  any small delay can cascade in to much larger delays further on especially if multiple forms of public transport are involved.And finally, the average person doesn’t have a say on how many trains or buses serve a particular route, this is all at the discretion of the local council or government and services can be withdrawn or scaled back without any recourse.That being said, I think probably London Underground is comparable to a car but no other public transport systems in the UK can even come close.","It depends on the public transport system and the distances involved.

"177","CMV: AI voice generation should be banned. Not all ""progress"" is good.","I can see very few legitimate use cases for this technology that don't outweigh the massive problem of being able to convincingly and cheaply impersonate others - which is, let's face it, the main reason these systems are being developed. Never-mind the economic implications for voice performers, or the various issues with image rights and copyright, being able to generate high fidelity impressions of any specific individual - not just celebrities - is **extremely dangerous**. I'm afraid I'm not very convinced by the efforts of the founder of Eleven Labs, to ""reach out"" to the Twitter community for ideas on safeguards, when he and everyone else's primary concern is getting to the next funding round and maximising returns. Safeguards in these AI systems are easily bypassed, and in any case such safeguarding should not be left to these companies alone to determine.In my view this needs to be regulated, and in the absence of regulation, banned. And since - at least in my country of the UK - many of our politicians and regulators are completely illiterate about these machine-generation models, banning it outright seems the safer option.I recognise though that this is a fairly reactionary view, so I'm interested in hearing from anyone who feels the risks *can* be managed and feels there are sufficiently interesting use cases which justify this technology.","There is a lot of debate surrounding this topic, but ultimately I think that AI voice generation should be banned. While there may be some advantages to having AI-generated voices, there are many potential negative consequences as well. For example, if AI voice generation is allowed, it could lead to increasingly lifelike voices that could be used to deceive or even harm people. In addition, AI voice generation could create a situation where people have little control over their own speech, which could have negative affects on their mental and emotional well-being. Thus, while there may be some benefits to using AI voice generation, I believe that it should be strictly prohibited in order to protect people's safety and privacy."
"178","CMV: The death penalty/murder is never the answer.","I just saw the footage of that nineteen old being sentenced to life in prison because of that massacre in Buffalo where he murdered 17 innocent people in a predominantly African-American neighborhood supermarket. The people in the courtroom were noticeably upset because they believed he was lying about his remorse which I totally understand. Some guy actually rushed the bench and had to be restrained. I talked to my Mom about it, and she said he deserved to be executed. In today’s society, I do not think murder is ever the answer whether it’s a person or a government. I understand that at times throughout human history, a death sentence may have been the only solution because there just weren’t enough resources to properly incarcerate an individual, so we don’t have to go down the “What about Hitler, etc…” road.My definition of murder is a premeditated slaying of a non-consenting human. This eliminates things like self-defense, euthanasia, coercion, etc… I’ll try to reply as much as I can because I’d like to understand more about where my mom is coming from. She got weirdly defensive when I simply said, “I don’t think murder is ever the answer.”Edit: I’m loving the discussion so thank you for the replies! I’m going to sleep pretty soon, but I’ll try to get back to this as fast as I can.Edit2: Thanks again for all the replies. I guess where I'm at now is that the death penalty should be allowed for people who without any doubt committed truly heinous acts deliberately and repeatedly. The process in which the death penalty is enforced should be much more rigorous than it currently is because too large of a percentage of people are sentenced to death due to either a)their crimes not warranting such a harsh punishment or b)their discovered innocence.","This statement is fundamentally wrong.

K-12 grade in the USA public schools.Disclaimer: I am not from the US and wasn't educated there.The reason that I advocate school prayer is that1. Students of the same faith, and even of different faiths, can band together in unity. Prayer brings people together, to share in worship.2. Prayer, just like speech or song, is a form of expression. This gives students the opportunity to openly, or privately, pray, which conveys the love of their God.3. Prayer can help guide students to make the right decisions, and better choices throughout the school year. It is nice to start the day with prayers. This way, the students can take comfort in knowing that their day will be blessed.4. Through school prayer time, students can be exposed to different religions. If you have a diverse student body, consisting of many different faiths, students will be able to see that people pray in different ways. Being exposed to other religions can promote tolerance and kindness.5. Some religions require prayer time at certain times. In Islam for example, the Duhur prayer (midday) may fall in the lunch break of a student. Allowing the student time to pray in a quiet place would be respectful, even if the teacher doesn't believe.6. Prayer can calm the mind, making students feel happier and less stressed.The prayer should be at the start of the day (unless a student feels they should pray at a different time, like midday, even then extra prayers are good) It might be maximum 5-10 minutes, and non sectarian, so everyone can join in.Debate me because according to my friends I'm starting to sound right wing and conservative and a bit too pious. I want to change my mind.","There is no scientific evidence that prayer helps students academically, and in some cases it may even have negative effects. Public schools should not force students to pray before class starts."
"180","CMV: gun owners who do not anticipate killing someone else are bad gun owners.","E: Anticipate might be a strong word to use. What if we use ""willing to""? Thanks to aulock1 for pointing out the bad vocabulary. E2: It seems many are having a hard time arguing this successfully with me. Here's some hints: the easiest ways to cmv is to convince me that the rules I've built my argument on are faulty or false, and/or argue that the claims I've made that do not logically derive from these ground rules. E3: Well fellows, it's been fun but it's time for me to get back to my homework. First, let's get some basic rules down that we should all agree on. First is one of the gun rules: don't point it at things you aren't willing to destroy. Easy enough. Secondly, guns are not to be brandished. While it is apparently a person's right to openly bear arms, it is to remain inconspicuous and undrawn until it is needed. Let us assume some arbitrary situation where one may or may not draw their gun. If killing someone is not required, the gun should remain undrawn. Easy enough. If lethal force is believed necessary, the gun is drawn. This fulfills the second rule, where the gun is not freely wandering about and only drawn when (believed to be) needed. However, the gun cannot just be drawn (otherwise it's simple brandishing), it must be pointed at this assailant or dangerous entity. Using the first rule, we hereby label this target as ""something to be destroyed"". This target must therefore be shot and killed, otherwise the gunner has demonstrated that lethal force is not required and/or they are unwilling to destroy their target. As a corollary to this, it must therefore be true that an individual who willingly obtains a firearm (or any weapon frankly speaking) for self defense is willing to kill, otherwise they are simply a person on a power trip whether or not they realize it. Therefore, a person unwilling to kill should not own a self defense weapon. Furthermore, if a dangerous person is not killed by our protagonist gun-wielding fellow because the ""sanctity of life"" is paramount, they should also not be a gun owner due to their unwillingness to kill. Using two very simple rules that are widely (dare I say universally) agreed upon, I believe I have made a strong argument that gun owners who do not anticipate killing should not be gun owners. Of course, this is all within a self-defense context.","This is an oversimplification and does not reflect all gun owners."
"181","CMV: We should stop calling it the 'justice' system.","From what I understand the data indicates that capital punishment and harsh punishments don't do much to reduce recidivism and preventing crime (I mean, death obviously prevents recidivism but you get my meaning). So as loathe as I am to admit it we are better off adopting a more ReStOrAtIvE approach to justice because that results in less crime overall. But we should stop calling it the justice system then because turning rapists and killers into respectable members of society doesn't do dick for the victims, specifically *their* victim.Say you take a robber who shoots a store clerk in the face when he robs the place. You send him to whatever restorative program deals with guys like him and you convince him that actually killing is a very not nice thing to do, how he should ask for help when he's in financial trouble rather than rob a corner store, and it's a success. He's not going to hurt anyone again and he can deal with is emotions in a healthy way, etc.That does not do any justice for the store clerk. Or the family who's lives have been shattered by this robber's actions. All you've really done (in the long term) is  reward the robber. You've taken him in, payed for his life on the state's dime, treated him very gently(because restorative justice proponents are also in favor of humane prison conditions). Maybe his life in jail is even better than whatever shit neighborhood he came from. Maybe he even gets an education in jail so when he leaves he can have a better chance to find work, meaning he's in a better position in life than he was before he shot the clerk in the face.Fine, good thing that he's less likely to rob another store. But you've basically in the long term rewarded the guy. Justice, at its heart, is based on fairness. On people getting what they *deserve*. And it is 'fair' if you are hurt in the same way you inflict harm on another. If you shoot someone, you *deserve* to be shot. If you crush someone in a drunk hit and run, you deserve to have your own bones shattered, if you rape someone you deserve to be violated yourself.It's not a matter of 'justice' whether the criminal goes on to do it again. Justice means ensuring that the people involved are treated fairly, that they got what they deserved.  And if our robber friend murders a minimum wage store clerk, giving our robber the path to a brighter future is completely unfair to our store clerk and his family.Yes, 'restorative justice' does result in less harm overall, and we should adopt it. But we should stop calling it justice and instead call it something like 'the good public policy system.'And I think it's obvious how this doesn't do dick for the victims of truly heinous individuals, like Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy.","There are many systems in place to provide justice in a society. We should not call one system ""the justice"" system."
"182","CMV: All public high schools should be mandated to have at least one sex-ed class where porn is boldly presented and discussed.","My high school was farily progressive and had a comprehensive sex-ed class, but my teachers never discussed nor showed porn. I feel like that's irresponsible for a modern institution. They cannot really protect people from the negatives of the medium unless they actually display it.I've consoled many people on Reddit before about penis sizes. Many young men develop a belief through porn that the average penis length is around 6 inches. In reality, the average penis length is about ~5.1 inches. 6 inches would be in the top 10th percentile. Unfortunately, pornography has a tendency to use angles and even prosthetics to enlarge or reshape the genitalia of its participants that distort its viewers' perception of the world.This concerns me because the people who've vented to me had developed a sense of shame around their bodies that lead them to engage in self-isolation. There are men out there who have a micro-penis (<3.7in), a legitimate medical condition, but that affects roughly 1 in 200 men. Most men, however, do not have this condition, nor would they even know how to properly measure to actually find out. I've become frustrated with the amount of misconceptions out there that has lead to needless shame, doubt, and self-loathing.I know that some women also develop a sense of shame around their vaginas because they do not match the imagery in porn. It's problematic that young people have access to a distorted view of their bodies without any perspective to evaluate and challenge the information they are presented with.Yet, the issues above are really only about body dysmorphia. I have not even discussed the potential for young students to develop disruptive masturbation habits as a result of the medium that can lead to erectile dysfunction and other disorders. For instance, some people have developed habits where they masturbate 21+ times a month, or in the top 90th percentile of ejaculators. I do not want to fully disparage pornography. Everyone is different and people can engage with the medium in ways that are healthy. Frankly, they could masturbate to it 1000+ times month and still live normal, undisrupted lifestyles. However, for America's student population, I doubt that there isn't at least a notable portion that have developed negative feelings about themselves, disruptive habits, or unrealistic expectations around sex as a result of pornography. Their should be teachers out there who can navigate the awkwardness and challenge the narratives presented in the medium.Porn is too accessible and integrated into modern society for it not to play a role within sex-education. However, I recognize that it would be perceived as scandalous to bring it into the classroom. I would like to know your perspective. Perhaps there is a good reason to keep it out sex-ed classes.","While I think this suggestion is a good one, I do not think it is necessary. Some schools may feel more comfortable discussing porn in a smaller class setting rather than a larger class setting. Additionally, proactively discussing porn in public schools may be controversial and some students may feel uncomfortable or uncomfortable with the discussion."
"183","CMV: News channels should not censor brutality/gore, ESPECIALLY when reporting on war.","I find the entire tone of conversations about war far too casual. For example: ""I support Russia's invasion of Ukraine because (...)"" or ""We should send more weapons to Ukraine...""  Side note: this is not a CMV on the current war. It is a CMV on the reporting on it.The tone, which reflects people's views on this topic, is too casual because they have not properly seen the aftermath: pools of blood, limbs ripped from the body, broken/displaced bones, agonal respiration, screams of utter pain coming from grown men and women, choking... as well as the countless horrors that are associated with this ultimate form of violence.I think sheltering people from those horrors by censoring them on news channels and online sources does much, much more harm than good.It allows people to talk about those topics, which are the most important topics to rationally discuss, while being completely detached from their realities. They formulate opinions based on insufficient information and project them to whoever they are discussing this topic with.As someone who has seen countless uncensored videos (especially after the Russia-Ukraine war), I have been finding it more and more absurd how people discuss it. My entire opinion on wars has dramatically changed ever since I got more exposed to what *really* happens on a battlefield. Reading or hearing about it is *nothing* like seeing it. That said, news channels should show what wars really look like: not destroyed buildings, tanks, or aircraft, but rather dead human beings. Disfigured children. You get the idea. And everyone should be able to see this in full resolution, because it is a non-insignificant amount of people's realities.Finally, I think that as a modern society, we have become rather detached from death and brutality. While it is definitely a feat that we have arrived at this point, it is still pivotal that everyone is given the real picture and not just a curated glimpse of it, and let them formulate their opinions with *that* information in mind.","There is no absolute answer to this question, as it depends on the particular news channel and the particular war in question. Some news channels might choose to censor brutality and gore when reporting on war, while others might not. It is ultimately up to the individual news channel to decide what content it chooses to censor."
"184","CMV: Other countries should sanction the United States.","Preface: I'm cursed to be American. And if you couldn't tell by the title, I'm ashamed of that.I believe that other countries should impose sanctions against the United States. Here's why:**The Iraq War:** Yes, I know it started about 20 years ago. However, in a world where we heavily condemn Russia for invading Ukraine (which we should!), we caused far more damage to Iraq than Russia is to Ukraine. Shouldn't both invasions be treated with the same crushing sanctions, regardless of the victims' skin color?**COVID:** We let it run rampant. The pandemic might not have occurred if Trump hadn't disbanded the pandemic preparedness team back in 2018. Millions, perhaps tens of millions, are dead now who would have survived had Trump not done this. Additionally, last year's Canadian trucker convoy was inspired by the far-right in America. In a way, we invaded Canada.**Trump:** He not only pulled us out of the Paris Climate Accords, but he invited Putin to invade Ukraine by threatening to withhold military aid. But unlike Putin and Russia, we \*elected\* Trump. Sure, I voted for Biden in 2020 (I wasn't old enough to vote in 2016), but it looks likely that Trump will win, or at least come close, in 2024. He very well might launch a full-scale invasion to ""liberate"" Canada, since that's what Tucker wants him to do.**Human Rights:** I know nations like Iran, Russia, and China have abysmal human rights records, and I'm not going to wave that away. However, we do too. Women can't get abortions in many cases even if their pregnancies put their lives at risk. The Supreme Court is likely to overturn rulings allowing for gay marriage, contraception, and a free and open Internet (or, well, as free as it \*can\* be without net neutrality.) We have sanctions against Iran and Russia, so if we're applying an objective standard, we deserve sanctions too.So there you go. CMV.","There is no persuasive argument for other countries to impose sanctions on the United States. Sanctions would do nothing to change the US government’s stances on important issues, and would only punish the American people."
"185","CMV: Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is the best voting method for achieving the best representation.","Quickly define some phrases:Ranked Choice Voting - One person can vote (by rank) for multiple candidates. They can chose to vote for none or all. During voting calculations, the bottom candidates are removed and the top candidates move to the next round, with the eliminated votes contributing to the remaining candidates. Once someone gets +50%, tabulation is done.Best Representation - The resulting candidate has the most favorable opinion by the voters out of the entire candidate pool. If any other candidate was selected, the overall favorability would drop.Arguments for RCV:* You don't ""throw away"" your vote* It allows third party candidates to become viable, increasing the representation* Candidates can be ranked, so you can identify your first choice.Arguments against RCV* It's confusing - This is mainly a factor of it being a new system, but should not disqualify it. If we had always used RCV, we would not be arguing for FPTP type voting systems because ""they're simpler"".EDIT: I need to call it, but thanks all for the discussion. In summary, I still think RCV is the best for a majority of cases, but in some instances (especially large multi-seat races), something like Borada may prove valuable. I don't believe Alaska was a failure of RCV, but it gave me some interesting things to think about regarding rare mathematical instances.I might still come back and argue with a few of you, but for the most part I'm done.","There is no single best voting method, and there is no one answer to this question. RCV is a voting method that gives voters the ability to rank candidates in order of preference. This allows voters to express their preferences without having to choose only one candidate. This allows for the greatest number of votes to be cast for the candidate who is most preferred."
"186","CMV: Saying Christ or Jesus as an expletive is the least grave or meaningful interpretation of taking the Lord's name in vain.","This is one I've circled back to a few times, but tl;dr there's a goodly chunk of Christians that believe saying Jesus, God or Christ as an expletive constitutes taking the Lord's name in vain, and a smaller(but still sizable) portion of Christians that are gravely offended by it. From the literal interpretation I've always taken that to mean as ""you shall not speak the Lord's proper name unless circumstances specifically demand it"" as in the name the Lord gave and usually isn't spoken at all. &#x200B;On the other hand I've also heard the moral interpretation that taking the Lord's name ties in with bearing false witness, on the one hand depending on the size of your Bible the ban on false witness is on the same page as using the Lord's name, and more broadly in the context of Matthew 5:37, you really ought not to be making any oaths before God for anything because you shouldn't be lying at all, let alone enough to merit such an oath. &#x200B;With those two understandings I've always struggled with where ""don't say Jesus when you stub your toe"" fits in. Sure it seems a bit profane and thoughtless, but it's not directed at anyone in particular in such circumstances any more than saying ""Christ"" if your engine catches fire. I understand the Bible generally describes thoughtlessness as problematic, but most passages regarding speaking ill/profanity/etc. usually describe the context as carrying a degree of malice or speaking in a manner damaging to another person. &#x200B;All this to say, I have trouble really being on the same page with those who treat using one of the above terms as an unintentional expletive as a serious or grave sin. I can accept it may be a venial sin for being generally thoughtless, but the other interpretations certainly seem much more perilous and damaging. &#x200B;CMV.","There is no clear definition of the term ""the Lord's name in vain,"" but some believe it refers to using God's name in an disrespectful or mocking way. Using the name of Christ in this context could be considered the least serious form of blasphemy, as it is not typically considered an offensive word."
"187","CMV: The ritual of playing the US National Anthem at sporting events is wrong.","EDIT: Thanks for all the perspectives. It's definitely highlighted some of my own internal biases. I've realized that I don't consider the National Anthem as politically neutral. I unintentionally associated with specific political movements. Furthermore, I've been mentally gatekeeping the Anthem to only government entities. That's wrong. The Anthem belongs to all Americans, and we should be free to use it however we want, and the more people use it, the less it's tied to specific political movements.It's still propaganda, but in the big scheme of things, not a huge deal.Go sports ball!\------------------The way the US national anthem is used at sporting events is wrong. It's crass advertising at best, or manipulative propaganda at worst.At least at the Olympics, or FIFA, I understand it's intended to be a friendly national rivalry.But at events like college sports, NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, these are fundamentally entertainment venues. They have absolutely nothing to do with national patriotism. There's no civic duty involved. There's no sacrifice for country involved. This is not the funeral for our servicemen or front line first responders who gave their lives for country. This is not a political rally, or townhall. We are paying money to be entertained.If we stood for the national anthem to before watching Captain America punch Thanos in the face we would recognize there's some dystopian shenanigans going on.I understand WHY these organizations do it. Every advertising agency wants to link their product to national pride. It sells tickets. But for other products we understand it to be crass and not to be overdone. If you slap flags and eagles with striped hats shooting M16's onto breakfast cereal, we recognize it to be naked opportunism, not a genuine love of country.Furthermore, the WAY it's done is pure propaganda. Everything stops. Everyone stands up. Everyone puts their hand on their heart, and everyone stops to stare at a flag and sing along. If I flipped the flag and song and changed the location to a foreign country, we would recognize this to be cult of personality brain washing.I understand WHY the government is ok with this. People like their sports ball. Associate the government with love of sports ball means the populus has good brain juices towards Uncle Sam.I also understand that most people just go along with it without thinking too hard. It's a small gesture and a ""cultural"" thing.But that makes it worse for me. This is a systematized ritual where corporate greed and mindless nationalism are used to sell entertainment, while pushing large groups of people for mindless love of country. There is no critical thought to the actual process of government, attempts to improve or country, or truly appreciate both the good and bad of our country. It's 2 minutes of ""America F\*ck Yeah!""","There are many cultural and political reasons why playing the US National Anthem at sporting events is wrong. First, it is a reminder of the US’s imperial past. The anthem was originally written as a rallying call to support the US wars of conquest in the 1800s. Second, the anthem is often Played to partisanship and exclusion, rather than inclusion and patriotism. For example, the anthem is traditionally Played at baseball games when the home team is winning, but is often avoided at games when the home team is losing. Finally, the anthem is often played at events that are marketed to a primarily white, American audience, while excluding the voices of people of color."
"188","CMV: Focussing on oppression makes people see oppression where it isn't present. So, focussing on prejudices against you is damaging to yourself and you should live life assuming there aren't any.","I guess there's two parts to this:1. focussing on oppression makes people see oppression where it isn't presentThis should be pretty obvious. If you're constantly looking for something, you're likely to see evidence of it even if it doesnt exist. Benign example could be: ""I'm having a really bad hair day, everyone can tell. 'X' Coworker didn't look at me because of my bad hair"" etc etc. The more you focus on something, the more you assume others are as well. This just isn't true.2. So, focussing on prejudices against you is damaging to yourself.This extends to bigger issues than a bad hair day. If you are constantly consuming media saying that you are oppressed in a certain environment, you'll see or prepare for injustice even if there isn't any.eg. if you assume police are biased against you when pulled over for a basic offence. Instead of complying you question them, so they aggravate. End result, worse for you.eg. a male coworker points a mistake in your work you assume they're mansplaining, you miss out on a learning opportunity. End result, worse for youA good counter to this is, what benefits do you see in your own life by seeing life through the lens of your oppression?","POC: Oppression exists on many levels, from the micro level of everyday racism and discrimination to the macro level of systemic racism and discrimination. I believe that it is important to focus on all forms of oppression, as they all intersect and are interconnected. It is also important to remember that not all members of oppressed groups experience oppression to the same degree or in the same ways. For example, people of color may experience racism and discrimination on a daily basis, while people who are LGBTQ+ may experience more systematic forms of oppression."
"189","CMV: There is no hope of any real change to prevent climate change.","Everytime I see people talking about avoiding the worst of climate change I feel like it is already a lost cause for the following reasons.1. There is essentially zero chance of any real policy change in the United States in the next 20 years due to the political environment. This to me is clear from the response to mass shootings and COVID. It seems that there is no death toll and no amount of bodies or damage on the news that can create real regulatory change. Add to this a right leaning supreme court that will be in power for decades that will limit executive aughority to enact change and there seems to me zero chance of any regulatory change.2. With the current geopolitical climate and what appears to be the beginnings of a new cold war between the east and the west. Other major powers are disincentivized to enact change that can weaken their power especially if the United States is not making any change. As any transition away from fossil fuels comes with at the very least the risk of lost/lower economic production.3. That leaves us with a situation where all the major polluters continue with minimal emissions reductions for the foreseable future. Even if the EU and most of the developing world halt all their emmisions roughly 50% of the worlds emissions will continue on uncheck.What makes other people think there is any chance of real change to the status quo? (Without some miracle scientic breakthrough of cheap safe fusion power, as that has been a few decades away for decades.)","Some people may hope that there is hope of some kind of real change to prevent climate change, while others may feel there is no hope. There is no single answer that accurately reflects the views of everyone. There are a variety of reasons why some people may hope for change while others may not, and opinions will likely vary depending on individual circumstances and perspectives."
"190","CMV: The fact that Americans do not have taxes automatically deducted from their paycheques and instead have to file/pay every year is unjustifiable and a pretty obvious case of regulatory capture.","**UPDATE: Turns out I was, in fact, missing something. There was a YouGov poll asking Americans** [**What foreign ways of doing things would you embrace**](https://today.yougov.com/topics/society/articles-reports/2023/02/10/what-foreign-ways-doing-things-would-americans-emb) **which includes ""The government calculating your tax and automatically deducting it from every paycheck, meaning employees don't have to fill in tax returns every year."" That's what led me to believe that Americans simply receive their gross earnings and have to pay them entirely at the end of the fiscal year.** **Given the responses below sharing that taxes** ***are*** **automatically deducted, I'm not entirely sure what that YouGov question is really about!**I never knew that Americans didn't do this. When US comedians or TV shows would talk about employees ""doing their taxes"" or not paying, I was always confused.Where I'm from (Canada) and most other countries I know of, if you're an employee then your federal/provincial income tax, public pension contributions, employment insurance, etc. are automatically deducted from your paycheque and remitted to the government revenue agency by your employer. You don't have to worry about filing tax returns to pay your taxes at the end of each year. You still file your taxes, but for most people it's a matter of entering deductible expenses (charitable donations, investments into tax-free investing accounts, etc.) to figure out how much of a return they get.I can't comprehend why this wouldn't be done except to generate demand for professional services. It's like governments in the US are intentionally maintaining a more complex, expensive tax collection system (with the risk of making honest mistakes that could put you in legal jeopardy), for no reason but to make H&R Block or Intuit more money.Am I missing something? What could the justification for a system like this possibly be?","I think it's more complicated than that. I think it's a combination of factors, with some people benefiting more than others. For example, people who have high incomes or pay high taxes already have their taxes taken care of automatically. For people who don't, it can be more complicated and time-consuming to figure out and file. And, of course, there are all the lobbyists who work to make sure the system works the way it does."
"191","CMV: Media piracy isn’t stealing","My view: pirating media (movies, music, games, etc.) isn’t the same as stealing and companies are overblowing the effects that media piracy has of them.My arguments:1) **Stealing implies the loss of something**. If I steal your car, you no longer have your car. If, on the other hand, I made an exact copy of your car, nobody could claim that I stole your car. One might argue that I stole a *sale* of the car, but that brings me to my second argument…2) **It can only be considered a loss if I were planning on paying for the item in the first place**. If I had no intention of buying the media in question, then piracy can not be considered a loss. Going back to the car analogy, if I copied your car, one could argue that I stole a sale from the manufacturer, however that argument inherently implies that I would have paid for the car if I didn’t have the means to replicate it. That’s a big assumption to make. When people claim that piracy costs [$29 billion per year](https://cybernews.com/news/piracy-costs-entertainment-industry-billions-says-report/), that carries with it the assumption that everyone who pirated that content would have paid for it if they had to. If, however, people had no intention of ever paying for it, it can’t be considered a loss and therefore can’t be considered stealing.So that’s my view - please change it!",", it’s sharingCMV: Media piracy is not stealing, it’s sharing. Piracy is the unauthorized copying, distribution or other use of copyrighted materials. While sharing may technically be considered a form of piracy, it is much more commonly seen as a form of free speech.When people pirate media, it’s often because they don’t have the money to buy the product or they want to share the product with their friends. Piracy does not create any additional revenue for the companies that produce copyrighted material, and it can actually lead to decreased sales. Piracy also risks damaging the industry’s reputation and creating a negative perception of the media.In the digital age, piracy is more common than ever before. However, it is not the only way to get access to copyrighted materials. There are many lawful ways to consume media, and piracy is not the only problem with the digital age. copyright infringement and cybercrime are also serious issues."
"192","CMV: Instead of professional entertainers, the NFL Super Bowl halftime show should feature the nation's ""best"" college band.","The ""best"" can be selected by a voting process, or (my preference) thru some sort of competitive playoff system running parallel to the championship bowl series. I would not link the best band to the NCAA championship team. The benefits are: 1. We can repurpose the entertainer spend as a financial award to the winning school, the band program, a charity of the band's choosing, etc. something other than an entertainer / entertainment industry. 2. It would re-establish some of the excitement about the halftime show that seems to have dwindled. 3. I think the performances would be better / more creative / more exciting / more dramatic... ultimately, more entertaining. Arguments that might move me away from this position might include: 1. this would add some sort of negative influence on college bands, and they're better left alone. 2. a compelling argument that the NFL would somehow lose out on revenue. by compelling, it can't simply be stating ""that they would"". i am dubious that they would, since i think more people would be interested in a band champ's performance than a professional entertainer. and if so, the NFL would sell more add revenue, not less. so convince me they'd sell less ads. 3. that college bands wouldn't be able to put together a better product. i'm dubious here, but again, this sits in the, ""i might change my mind about this"" space. Arguments that would not move me away from this position: 1. personal preference arguments:    1. It wouldn't be fun. --> this is a a personal preference. i'm not saying you have to like it, but this argument doesn't address the unique benefits of allowing this be an award given to the best college band.    2. the performers are better --> again, a personal preference argument. 2. its not realistic / practical / feasible --> perhaps, but not what im talking about","This option is simple, and would allow college bands from all across the country to compete in a halftime show competition. This would be an exciting display of musical talent, and would be a great way to hype up the crowd before the game starts."
"193","CMV: Wealth AND satisfaction comes from having a non-money, yet money-tied identity/purpose","I’ve spend a bunch of time interviewing NFL players, learning more about their financial journey (especially since many of them went from lower-class incomes to making millions a year).I’ve also spent time personally amongst some very wealthy people (graduated from Harvard).I’d like to understand more about why some people get wealthy and others don’t, and why some very wealty people are deeply unsatisfied.Here’s my current thinking: those that are happiest AND are able to gain wealth sustainably are taught to have identities/life goals that satisfy 2 criteria\-they are NOT directly “make a lot of money”\-yet, they are tied to making money somehowFor example, a life goal of “be happy” or “raise amazing children” won’t make you wealthy, but a goal like “bring joy to as many families as possible through making fun toys” probably would, as people pay money for toys(so, it’s a non-money identity..but still tied to a way to make money)  But, if your goal was \*just\* “make a ton of money”, that could easily be taken away from you, and once you have a ton of money (like a pro athlete or lottery winner), the money alone is likely to feel more meaningless.Thoughts?","It’s interesting to me that while many people might think that having a money-tied identity or purpose is what brings them happiness, this isn’t always the case. For some people, it can actually be something that brings them stress and unhappiness.That’s what I think happens with a lot of people who are stuck in a cycle of chasing money. They’re constantly struggling to make more money, which in turn makes themhappy because they think they’re achieving their goals. But the truth is that they’re actually only achieving the superficial goal of making more money.When you have a non-money, yet money-tied identity or purpose, you can truly be happy.

I think this system should be abolished and we should adopt the Dutch or Israeli model of legislation, proportional representation. The percentage of votes a party gets is the percentage of seats it gets in the National Parliament. Local representation should be ended. Think about it, when was the last time you genuinely and truly cared about your local representative, almost never. Now Reddit is chronically online and thus, knows and cares a lot more about politics than your average person. But even in this chronically online case, do you really care about who your local representative is? Not really. There are only two real circumstances where you might care: (1) You live in a place with a weirdly strong local identity. (2) Your representative is really amazing or really horrible. And these circumstances are not present in the vast majority of cases. If you live in a place with a strong regional identity, perhaps local representation is worth preserving but even in this case, a political party to represent their interests could be formed.Most politicians, owing to the law of averages are just average, not someone you really have strong opinions on, either way. Local representation also means systems like FPTP, which is horrible or RCV, which is less horrible. But both systems are highly prone to gerrymandering and wasted votes. In both cases, the power of your representative is unaffected whether they won by 50+1% or by a massive margin like 75%. I will admit that the Single Transferable Vote deals with these problems quite well but I still don't see the value of local representation.Most people will vote for any person with a D or R next to their name. If you broadly identify as Democrat, you are just gonna vote for the guy with a D next to his name, same for Republicans. If this is norm, then why bother pretending that it's really just local elections for a national legislature? We might as well make our voting system actually reflect how people think about voting. People vote based on parties, not individual people. Let's just make that official."," in favour of district councilsThere is a case for district councils in Malaysia. The current system of local representation, where each state or federal district has a local council, is inefficient and leads to fragmentation of parliament.District councils are better placed to handle local issues, as they are closer to the people. They can also be more responsive to the needs of their constituents.There are some disadvantages to district councils. They can be less financially stable than local councils and they can be less engaged in policymaking.Overall, district councils are a good way to represent local populations. They should be replaced by district councils in Malaysia."
"195","CMV: The Phrase ""All Cops Are Bad"" is and ignorant phrase which suggests no or a ludicrous solution","my current view is that this phrase seems:1 - completely reductive of the good and valuable work many Cops do. more focus is given when Cops fail to do their job or commit awful crimes themselves but on the daily many crimes are solved including the most heinous crimes such as murder, sexual assault and the abuse of children. dealing with these crimes is objectively a difficult and harrowing task and the people that deal with them correctly should be commended2 - the phrase ACAB implies no solution. it suggests that any ""good"" person should immediately quit the police force, thus we are left with either no police force or even worse still, one made up entirely of ""bad"" people. so what is a ""good"" person that is currently a cop supposed to do?3 - I believe that although systemic racism is evident in the US, a large proportion of the issues involving Cops and civilians is due to americas gun laws. in my country neither the police nor the public are armed so the vast majority of interactions with police is typically very calm and tensions are low. in the US both parties fear for their lives due to the potential presence of deadly weapons - this point is a slight tangent to the main issue however"," to the problem of policing in the United StatesThere is no single solution to the problem of policing in the United States, as policing in the United States is a complex and multi-faceted issue. The phrase ""all cops are bad"" suggests that there is no solution to the problem of policing, when in actuality, there are many different solutions to the problem of policing that need to be explored and implemented. This phrase is also ignorant, as it suggests that all police officers are bad, when in fact, not all police officers are bad."
"196","CMV: Insurance companies should be allowed to add a surcharge for obesity","Under the Affordable Care Act insurance companies are allowed to charge up to 50% of the premium as a surcharge to smokers. They are prohibited from a surcharge for obesity because it is considered a pre-existing condition.The cost to insurance companies for smoking according to CDC recent figures is $170 billion. For obesity the cost is $174 billion. 13% of Americans smoke. 42% are obese.The CDC says:""Genetic changes in human populations occur too slowly to be responsible for the obesity epidemic.""Obesity, with very rare exceptions, is entirely a result of behavior: poor diet and lack of exercise.Smoking is also a behavior. But smoking addiction can be as difficult or even harder to stop than obesity. Smoking can result in a chemical addiction akin to that of illicit drugs. The only way to end it is by not smoking.Obesity is a result of food choice and portion control. Eliminating obesity does not require stopping eating.It doesn't matter to my argument how you label obesity. Call it a disease or an addiction. But both are treatable and preventable and are almost entirely handled by behavior modification. I see no good reason why smokers can be charged extra and obese people cannot.","-related conditionsYes. Obesity-related conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, are major health concerns and are associated with higher health care costs. Insurers should be allowed to add a surcharge for these conditions."
"197","CMV: Adoption can be a good thing.","Recently I've come across a movement on social media that is passionately anti adoption, equating it with slavery and chastising adoptive parents for daring to ""want"" a child.The people weighing in on this seem to be sincere, and their position doesn't seem to stem from any political, religious or other common social movement that would push that kind of narrative for duplicitous reasons. it appears to be it's own thing. And I 100% don't get it.I DO understand that there exists a world of for-profit adoption agencies with sketchy practices, I'm happy to denounce those. And I'm happy to acknowledge that adoption, even at a very young age can be a source of trauma. But I don't really see the good alternative for actual cases where someone's birth parents or close family can't or won't raise the kid.I would even be willing to concede that some large numbers of adoptions might fail somewhere in the process when there were better options possible to keep the kids with their birth parents or extended family. But that's not really the position I'm countering, these people never give facts or figures about prevalence of these issues or the reality of their alternatives, it seems like just ""Adoption is bad"".When people in this movement are asked what should happen to kids, they default to either they should go to some extended family or they should go into permanent guardianship.The first option I can see would be preferable to going with strangers. But as I understand it, when parents die or lose custody, any state agencies involved DO give strong preference to placing with extended family whenever possible. And if there are gaps or problems with that process, then the problem is with the process, not with adoption itself, and the call should be to fix that process, not to shame adoptive parents.And as for ""permanent guardianship"" I have a hard time seeing how raising someone but not calling them your child is a better alternative, it seems to other them even more than the trauma of adoption.""Oh hi this is Billy my son and Tommy, a kid I'm taking care of who is not my son."" I don't see what's gained there or how it lessens any trauma of adoption.I'm open to changing my view because it seems like I must be missing something in their position. I've seen so many people sounding very sincere and passionate about this.","It depends on the situation. For some families, adoption can be a perfect solution to their child's needs. For others, adoption may not be the best solution for their child. It is important to consider all of the options before making a decision."
"198","CMV: Men are judged for their clothes about the same as women, it's just ignored","I've seen when restriction are placed on women's clothing in a public environment, people always say ""men are never judged for their clothing""! They are, probably as much as women but the difference is men generally don't fuss about it and people don't make as much noise.My school banned strapless shirts and people got in an uproar about it saying rules are only ever made for girls, completely ignoring that boys actually had much stricter clothing such as not being allowed to sag pant, wear hats or even sweatpants. I worked at a gym where the rule was no midriff and told a girl she had to wear something over her sports bra. She complained about it being sexist despite me telling a fat man who tied his shirt above his belly the same thing not 10 minutes earlier (It's actually what prompted me to tell her)[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1129n55/people_that_wear_their_pants_like_this/) is the post that prompted this.I left a comment saying>I think it's funny how people always say ""Men are never shamed for their clothes"" yet post like this aren't even rare.  >  >What is mildly infuriating about this? Are you offended or being harmed in some way by the way this man chooses to wear his clothes? He is fully covered with not a single piece of skin showing. Are you worried he will fart and without that second layer of protection it will plosion you? Are you also mildly infuriated when women walk around in tight leggings which arguably show much more? I couldn't imagine being htat stressed out all the time.  >  >I am genuinely curious what is it that rustles your jimmies about this?I would love for anyone to answer these questions.&#x200B;Also going through the comments, a ton of them are like ""so tempted to grab a banana and insert it"" or ""In prison this means you want to get it in the butt"".&#x200B;So my view is that men and women are both judged for their clothes, women just make more noise about it. If men were to complain I think they'd just be told get over it"," moreThis isn't entirely accurate.

"199","CMV: Using whataboutism as an argument is often just hypocrisy.","Edit: please notice that I'm talking specifically when there is an action suggested and not a pure philosophical/moral discussion. ""A did this therfore we should do X to A"" It's an word used by people that want to criticize something while being biased. Usually they refer to the moralic aspect but that is just hiding behind emotions when you can't have a valid argument. Usually what they do is suggest some action against one side and just say whataboutism when someone suggest that the same action should apply to their side as well then.This leads to echo chambers as others gets irritated arguing with those people and just ignore them. Which leads to that a community where only people with the same bias stays and reinforce each other. It's probably also related to the trend of emotional arguments instead of logical ones.Edit: I'm calling the person saying whataboutism for hypocrite not the one bringing up another scenario.Edit: Lots of arguments about the current problem should be addressed. My retubuttial against that is two sides will always find new problems about their opponents instead of a balanced view. This leads to more polarization as it's easier to just continue attacking your opponent instead of trying to reason with the other side.","If you are using ""whataboutism"" as an argument, then you are most likely hypocritical."
"200","CMV: Biden intentionally did a very slow rollout of student loan forgiveness to give the R's time to get a court case together."," If he was actually serious he wouldn't have given them such a long time to respond. He would've sent letters out the same day that the loans are forgiven, which would've allowed borrowers to countersue even if the courts struck it down, because borrowers would've already received notices the balance was forgiven. Even if not, Biden could just set REPAYE payments to 0% of disposable income, and the amount of payments needed for forgiveness to 5 payments or something. Overall Biden seems to once again be paying lip service, while doing the absolute least he possibly can. Frankly, even $20K is very little when my grandparents could get a better job with a HS diploma than I can get with a CS degree.Even beyond that, his changes to the ""hardship"" factor in Student loan bankruptcy cases is rather lackluster. If he was actually serious he could just direct the DOE to automatically assume that all applications qualify under ""hardship"". I also find it interesting the R's waited until the day after the election to file the lawsuit, it almost seems like a coordinated deal. Overall Biden seems completely disingenuous to say the least, and more likely just wants to say ""welp, at least I tried guys"".","There is no evidence to support this accusation."
"201","I slept with my female friend even though I am gay. I don't know what else to do.","I don't know where to start. It is a massive fuck up from my part. For starters, I (30M) was in a relationship with my boyfriend John (30M) for 7 years. I found out he was having an affair with a married man (34M). I got to know because that married man's wife, Kelly (32F) showed up to my place to talk to my boyfriend but he wasn't there at that time. That's when she informed me that my boyfriend and her husband has been having an affair for 3 years. The woman just cried in front of me. And we both confronted each other's significant others. I broke up with John and Kelly got a divorce. Over the last 3 years Kelly and I have started to talk. At first she approached me by saying a lot of her family and friends are against her because she is not happy with her husband coming out and even calling her homophobic. I explained to her that she wasn't homophobic. It is justifiable for her to feel hurt over this. She is a nice and kind woman. I liked her. I liked spending time with her. Her friends have also became my friends. She and I helped each other through our tough times. Over the last 3 years we have been in and out of relationships with other people. Last night she called me and said she is alone because that day was her anniversary. I asked her if she needed me to be there, she told me yes if I don't mind. I went there. We were lying on her bed and kinda tipsy from all the alcohol. We were talking and she said how much she feels alone and humiliated by her ex-husband. I said I understand. Then she snuggled closer to me and kissed me. She immediately stopped and said sorry multiple times. I just brushed it off and said it's fine we are just tipsy. The next time I kissed her and one thing led to another we had sex. And it was not like I hated it or repulsed by her. In fact we did it 2 more times before falling asleep. The next morning we talked. She says that she understands that I am going through some stuff and said sorry if I ever felt forced. I told her no, it was consented. I left her place. I don't know what happened to me. I knew I was gay since I was 18. But I did like sleeping with her. I don't know. Maybe I need to rethink my life choices. Is this something normal?","It's not easy to come out as gay and it's not easy to tell someone that you've had sex with a female friend. Figuring out what to do next may feel even more daunting. There are a few things that you can do, depending on your situation.If you're comfortable with it, tell your friend that you're gay and that you had sex with her. It can be difficult for people to accept and it may take some time for them to process what you've told them, but your friend supports you and is likely to be supportive of your sexuality, no matter what.If you're not comfortable with telling your friend, you may want to consider ending the relationship. This is not an easy decision, but it may be the best thing for both of you. Ending the relationship will allow you to focus on building a healthier one with someone who is compatible with your sexuality."
"202","my boyfriend is gonna break up with me if i go abroad for college","i (f18) am a high school senior and i'm at the stage of applying to different universities. so i live in a city where going abroad for university is a really popular option, especially given its political state at the moment. i don't want to fully disclose the city i live in but it's known as an international city where a lot of non-native/foreign people, like us, reside.i've been dating my boyfriend (m18) for almost 2 years now and he's currently studying in a local university. i've been wanting to study in australia for a while now, even before i met my bf. my family is planning to immigrate there and my older sister already got a job there and is in the works of managing her move. my boyfriend and i talked about studying in australia together but he ended up not being able to go. now it's my turn to decide whether i want to stay here or study there. i'm getting really anxious at the fact that even though the local universities here are highly regarded and have high global university rankings, i feel that their education won't really work with me. and having studied in a local school previously and currently being in an international school allowed me to compare the two environments. and i feel stuck in a local environment since they're so competitive and have a toxic learning environment. i also feel like i would thrive being abroad since this city is so suffocating, i just want to get out. but at the same time, i applied for the national university here and im scared i won't be able to get in.my parents are kinda encouraging me to go to australia and they know that the only reason i want to stay is because of my boyfriend. i know that it's wrong to let him hold me back, but my love for him runs really deep. but im questioning whether it's right to stay with him since he's letting me know that he would want to break up with me if i ultimately go to australia for university since he can't manage long distance relationships. i thought that partners would encourage their significant other to achieve great things and that they would stick by them despite ldrs being really difficult. i know that's an immature way of looking at relationships but i've seen that work for my oldest sister and her husband before they got married.i feel like this might be able to summarise everything you need to know about my situation but i still have so many f thoughts and feelings but i don't think they're relevant for this post. i just don't really know what to do right now. do i stay here with someone i genuinely see a future with or do i go to australia and potentially lose a lifelong partner?","There's no guarantee that your boyfriend would break up with you if you go to college overseas. However, if his expectations for you differ greatly from what you can realistically achieve given your circumstances, he may feel justified in ending the relationship.

"203","I lied about my name and I'm scared he'll think it's a red flag","I (24 F) lie to everyone about my true name and recently I've started dating someone (26 M) and I'm scared for the day he finds out. Backstory, almost 3 years ago I moved to where I now live (600 miles from my hometown) without telling anyone (aside from my family) and changed my name (although not legally as I'm scared to offend my parents as I know it would). I did this under the advice of the police after my stalker of 7 years wouldn't leave me alone despite multiple police calls and 3 restraining orders. Unfortunately, in Canada it's hard to convict an individual for breaking a restraining order so the police were unable to do anything. Because of this, they advised me to move, lock up my social media and change my name; so I did just that. Because of that, I've grown accustomed to my new name, it's safe to me and my old name is not. Everyone where I live only knows me for my fake name (except for 2 individuals who were meeting my family so I had to explain myself). However I'm scared to tell the new guy. I know it will come up as I have a matching tattoo with my father and both our names are on it. I'm scared he won't believe my story (as many people have not for the fact that it seems so outlandish and something that only happens on tv) and will think of me as a liar. Any advice? Maybe comfort? Any thoughts and opinions would be greatly appreciated.","There is no inherent connection between a name and a person's identity. If he finds out your name is a lie, it's not automatically a red flag - it's up to him to decide whether or not he thinks it's strange or suspicious. If he's questioning your identity or credibility, it might be time to rethink your name choice. However, if he's just curious or curious about your name, there is no reason to worry."

My state has odd statutory rape laws that DO NOT apply in this case. HOWEVER there is still the case of a hostile work environment! He recommended going to the manager once more and explaining the true weight of the situation, and told me to go to HR if they do nothing. He also said to try to find a way to contact his parents in an attempt to let them know that he needs serious help. Thank you so much for all the advice and for helping me relax bout a situation that is fairly easily taken care of!! I'll update again if anything else happensAlright! So I don't know what to do about any of this. I (20F) am a server at a local restaurant. I have a decent amount of underage coworkers that I'm always nice to because I remember what it was like to be a teenager around adults who hated me. However, this one busser (16M) has gotten some sort of delusion in his head that we're dating, and I'm worried it's going to ruin my life.I've heard from coworkers who are my age AND who are his age and go to school with him that he's been saying we've had sex, I've performed sexual acts on him, and that my long-term partner who I talk frequently about at work is a cover story. Apparently he's said these things both at work (less of the lewd rumors) and at school CONSTANTLY.I've spoken to him about this, I've spoken to my managers (unfortunately they can't schedule me around him, against corporate rules.) Every single time someone mentions these rumours I vehemently disspell them, but it's all just getting worse and I'm afraid he's going to absolutely ruin my life.Unfortunately quitting isn't an option as this is the only place I can work with my school schedule, and I've gone as far as threatening legal action. I'm at a loss as to what to do to make these rumours stop besides finding a way to contact his parents and begging them to get him help. What do I do?! I'm constantly on the verge of a panic attack...",".This could be a sign that the teenager is in a stage of developing a crush on you and is trying to build up your relationship in their own mind. It's also possible that the teenager is trying to create a relationship with you in order to feel more legitimate or understood. If the teenager keeps telling people we're dating, it might be a sign that they're not taking the breakup seriously and are still looking to cling to the relationship. In any case, it's important to be aware of how your teenage coworker is behaving and to communicate with them about any concerns you have."

This happen 3 months ago.He was upset that I confronted him about an ongoing issue with his work performance. I was polite, but firm. I had the charge nurse with me, she told him the same thing. He accused her of not knowing how to do her job, he yelled at her, wouldn't let her end the conversation, he said I would be the bad guy from now on. It all escalated very quickly, we tried to tell him he wasn't being disciplined, only that he has been asked to consider his co-workers regarding his behaviour.He followed me into the charting room, he yelled, blocked my exit, standing no more than 3ft from me. I told him my shift is over, I'm going home, I don't want to talk to you about this right now. Emotions were high, I just wanted to leave. He continued to yell, I had to put my hand up between us as a barrier and rise my voice above his to get him to leave. He did eventually leave. He has a history of attacking another aide on an elevator, I was seriously scared. There was a witness, another nurse, who initially agreed on the series events and how I felt about it when we reported it to our supervisor.But now, she is saying he wasn't aggressive, she is now claiming there were other witnesses when there were not. Management initially said this is very serious but now their internal review states he poses no threat. I took a little time off work while management did their review. No one arranged any meetings with me nor informed me that a review was conducted. No one told me that I ""can safely return to work"". I only found out through the Worker's Compensation Board because they sent me their findings letter.I don't know what to think. I'm questioning myself on what really happened. I'm upset because he has so many standing with him and I'm alone. But I also know what aggression looks like and that's how I perceived him.I don't know what to do. Do I just go back to work like nothing happened? Do I find a way to resolve my perception with how others saw it? I'm just at a loss. The WCB report states I have an ""adjustment disorder"". I feel humiliated. I was just scared and now I feel like I'm being punished. What do I do?","First of all, it's important to not overreact to this situation - if it was something that really wasn't serious, you'll eventually realize that.

"207","When does one know a relationship is no longer worth it?","I feel very lost. I have been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend for almost 1.5 years now. In the beginning, everything was great - we got along well, we have many things in common, he has great personality traits and life was genuinely just great and awesome and so happy. However, when we met, he had been a few months out of a burnout related to college. He had to quit his studies multiple times in various fields and needed medical help with his mental health, involving all sorts of a psychological tests etc etc, which I was highly supportive of. However, it’s been two years now or longer, and he is still unemployed, not studying, waiting for medical professionals to do their job and help him, basically until they find the ‘magic pill’ or therapy, it seems to me. He also wants to return to his previous studies. Whilst this was fine at first to me, nothing has changed since we started dating, except him increasingly becoming more disgruntled and me feeling like a companion more than a girlfriend. So far, I’ve also been the only one actually travelling to see him and setting money aside from my job as well as using my vacation days. We call almost every evening, but the calls have become repetitive, and they feel like a chore to me - I become annoyed that I have to call, and it makes me feel so bad. It’s in part due to the fact that whenever I want to vent, he immediately becomes offended, and he snaps at me over the smallest things, like me mispronouncing a word. I’ve become very quiet as a result, which isn’t satisfying to him either. He also never talks about his issues, and I never know what’s going on. I feel like he feels entitled to all my spare time. There was also this one time when my mother got horribly sick suddenly and I had to devote my time to her care and he yelled at me for ignoring him, acting like a spoiled child, which is now the main reason I am writing this post. However, when he’s happy and in a good mood, things are lovely and amazing. We share interests, he cares about me truly, and whenever we make up he tells me how much he loves me and how sorry he is. I just don’t know if this relationship is for me anymore. I understand I am not perfect either, I have made mistakes, but I feel like I am giving so much and it is still never enough, and I am walking on eggshells. It also makes me nervous because Idk what will happen after he gets the meds, if things will truly get better. I think I still love him dearly because I know he’s a great person, but it’s so difficult at the moment.","It is generally not difficult to determine when a relationship is no longer worth it. When one person in the relationship begins to make all the decisions without consulting the other, or when one person begins to mistreat or neglect the other, it is generally a sign that the relationship is headed in the wrong direction."
"208","My family members keep destroying my possessions","I (f18)know its pretty normal for those things to occure, especially with younger siblings. I have an older brother (20), younger brother (15) and a younger sister (11). Recently i found the 60 year old collectors wine of mine, which I'd received as a gift from my boyfriends step grandmother (and is a big wine collector) with poked hole in it. It was obviously destroyed and there was nothing i could do but to drink it (was very good too).None of my siblings would own up to it, I got blamed by my mom (yet again) for not hiding it well enough which isnt true because i hid it already somewhere in the basement and told everyone how much it means to me and not to touch it.This isn't the first time one of my possessions got destroyed and i dont know what to do about it. I cant move out yet because I'm an apprentice and dont earn enough but any advice would be nice!Edit: is it reasonable to ask my family pay me back the worth of the wine since its a few hundred bucks? Also I've often tried to put locks on my things only to find them broken later.","This could be indicative of a power struggle within your family. It could also be indicative of a lack of communication within your family. Either way, it's something that needs to be addressed. If your family members are frequently destroying your belongings, it might be best to talk to them about their behavior. You could also try to set up rules governing how your belongings are to be used. If communication is still an issue, then you might want to consider consulting with a therapist."
"209","How do I write a professional email complaining about my coworker?","I work as a front desk person in an appliance store. We have just moved to a new system where me and the other front desks have been reserving items in our warehouse for orders based on the order the orders were placed in the old system. We call it allocating. One of my sales people have been bothering me incessantly. He sends me emails to allocate things, then when I am unable to for whatever reason, he insists that I double and triple check. I do not mind doing that. But I do mind what he just did.He asked me yesterday to double check that an order was allocated correctly. So I did and I told him there were a few items that can't be allocated to his order. He asked me this morning to double check. I did and I even spent 20 mins making sure I wasn't wrong. I explained to him, via this same email thread, exactly why I can't allocate those items. I suggest he email our manager to find solutions to not having those items. Instead, what the sales person sends is ""Would you please look into allocation in the order of precedence?"" to our manager with me attached. In the same damn email thread.This butt head asked my manager to double check my work instead of asking for help to find solutions.I'm going to email that same manager to complain because that is so disrespectful after I went out of my way and wasted time checking something I knew I couldn't do anything to change.This is what I have so far, with company specific information redacted of course:""  This feels like a silly thing to be upset by, but \[Sales Person\]’s attitude toward me is very frustrating. Every time I allocate his orders, he questions me if I’m not able to allocate everything. I have to explain to him every single time why items aren’t getting allocated to his order and he expects me to double and triple check “just in case”. The \[Customer Name\] order really set me off because instead of asking you to help him find solutions, he asked you to double check my work. In the email thread you can see that I told him twice that the last three items on the order can’t be allocated. The second time I told him I got more specific and explained why I can’t do it.I don’t mind double checking things for him, but I do mind him making me do that and still expecting someone else to check my work. It’s disrespectful. ""I want to make sure it doesn't sound like I'm whining about him. I also want to make sure it doesn't come off as too aggressive because of how mad I am right now.","Dear [Employer],I am writing to express my disappointment with my coworker. She is not doing her job well and is constantly disrupting the team. I would like to have her replaced.Thank you for your time.Sincerely,[Your Name]"
"210","I don’t know how to end my first real relationship (or if I even should)","For reference, im 21, so im sorta lacking in experience for my age.I started seeing this girl officially about a month ago. Before that I was hurting pretty bad and was using casual intimacy as a kind of coping mechanism.Now that its been a month I just don’t feel about this girl like I did. She’s great and gorgeous and sweet and all that but its like I can’t see past her flaws. Im not as excited to see her as I was when we first started dating. We spend so much time together, maybe im just getting burned out or something. We don’t really connect well sexually either and I find myself thinking about other women. At the same time, she’s just so perfect. And she’s crazy about me which makes it hard to even consider ending it.And I don’t even know why im considering ending it because just one week ago I was certain I was in love. Is this just the honeymoon period ending? I still like her and like being with her and I even miss her if its been a few days but she just doesn’t make my heart beat fast like she did.","There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to end a first real relationship may vary depending on the specific circumstances. However, some tips on how to end a first real relationship effectively may include communicating with your partner openly and honestly about your feelings, setting realistic expectations for the relationship, and acknowledging the strengths and weaknesses of both yourself and your partner."
"211","Is it worth dropping friends even if it means you'll have no friends?","So I've always struggled to make friends. I have Asperger's so I struggle with social cues as it is but Im getting better out it however Im 25 now and still don't have a lot of friends. &#x200B;The friends I do have right now feel weird? They generally seemed like fun nice people at first however Ive learned none of them are exactly errrr open to doing things they don't want too? Or a better way of saying it is, I will work my butt off to do things for em/with em but if I wanna do something they won't make an effort. For example recently one friend wanted to see a comedy night during the work week, and I worked overtime in exchange for the morning off the next day even though Im not fussed on comedy stuff and just wanted to spend time together, but when I see an event Id like to do months away its either 'maybe ask me the week of' or 'no I dont like that'. &#x200B;I feel as if a lot of my friends and I don't have similar interests and sometimes Ill sit in the group and everyones laughing about x thing and I just can't relate. And by the time im caught up theyre onto the next thing.&#x200B;Worst of all lately, in my attempt to fill my free time and make myself feel better about my body, I started going to the gym. Rather than encouragement all I got was 'no you shouldn't count calories ','youre fine as is', 'its a waste of money' despite the fact Ive never felt stronger and eaten as well in my life ever.&#x200B;My gut wants to just cut ties off with them as I kinda feel like second fiddle. Ive stated this to them before and it gets shrugged off. Yet at the same time I dont wanna feel super lonely again, or have 0 friends. I really struggle and idk how to even make friends as an adult. I really don't know what to do or if im jumping to conclusions, any advice?","It's always worth dropping friends if it means you'll have more friends. Having more friends will make you happier and more fulfilled in life."
"212","Friend leaves all planning to me, but also complains I plan too much.","So, First things first, I have generalized Anxiety, so I understand the idea that I plan things out too much. But I often find myself in situations, where my friend doesn't plan enough, and kinda leaves it to me to plan.For Example: My Birthday Is Monday, and I asked If we could get together and do something. Now my friend, right now is on track while I am waiting for the next track to start school. We decide on Saturday, cause that's the best day for her, and I agree. But she also mentions that she would still have some work she needs to do for school. So to give her the leisure to do that work, I let her pick what time we do it. Today comes and I ask her what time do we gather and she replies with ""I don't know... You pick."" Granted I did not communicate with her that I was expecting her to pick the time, so I let it slide, as it was my fault for not communicating that. Now for the activity, she wanted to bring chicken wings, (Which was more something she wanted to do more than me), and I casually ask her about how long she needs to prepare the chicken. She simply states that she was planning on cooking the chicken DURING the party. Being a little on edge about it, but willing to work with her on it, I ask how long it's going to take... Again she replies... ""I don't know."" It turns out, all she has is raw chicken. no ingredients. No recipe. Just chicken. So I go and quickly find a recipe that's quick and easy, and I have all the ingredients needed. And I set a time to gather. Later I get the idea, that maybe she can come an hour early to cook the chicken, and I tell her about it. She then responds... ""No, I don't want to."" And I just respond with.. ""Okay.""I am upset that it feels like she didn't really put any further thought, on what she needed to do to accommodate her wants and needs. And it's even more frustrating, that recently she's been complaining that I overthink and over plan things. I've started thinking about what I should do... She's been my closest friend since Junior High school. And I understand that she has some mental problems of her own. But things like this frustrate me and hurt my feelings... I'm used to let these things slide and deal with it, but when I told my parents about this, they've been encouraging me to stand up for myself. I have talked to her about this before, and she has apologized... But it keeps happening...What should I do?","Your partner might be unhappy with how much planning you're doing, but they may also be unhappy with how much control you're relinquishing to them. If this is a recurring problem, it might be a sign that your partner is not completely comfortable with your independence. If this is the case, you might need to work on establishing more constructive ways of asserting your own priorities and capabilities."
"213","My girlfriend (23F) is asking me (23M) to unfollow girls I know on Instagram.","So my girlfriend of almost 1.5 years has very bad anxiety, and I do all that I can to ease her worries, reassure her I love her, and help her out. Things have been rough for us both personally, but our relationship has been good together for the most part.Today, out of the blue, I woke up to a long message about how she doesn't like me following other girls on Instagram (mind you, these are girls I've met once or twice either at EDM festivals, just out and about, struck up a conversation once or twice and or mutuals. I've never had anything romantic with them and I have no intentions on hitting them up/cheating on my girlfriend.). This was a recurring topic for a while that died down for a very long time, but just came up again. I told her I never talk to these girls online really, and I never check their pages, their feeds, etc and that there's nothing to worry about. I'm hardly even much of a media person outside of YouTube. I know she has problems with guys following models, but I don't do that. So I said that I don't want her to be controlling towards me because I'm never that way with her, and I'm not okay with her if she gives me this ultimatum when I've done so much for her to try to ease her anxiety and prove to her that I love her. (BTW she is posted on my Instagram so other girls would know I have a girlfriend anyway)She says that me being reluctant to unfollow them shows I value them more than I value my relationship with her and that me following other girls gives her the ick. But for me, it's not about her telling me to unfollow specific people -- for me, it's about upholding my standards and establishing what trust means and not letting other people tell me how to manage my social media, etc. I have no problem unfollowing these people, but I think it points to larger red flags if she feels this way simply about me following these girls I don't interact with at all.Am I in the wrong for not unfollowing these girls I don't interact with on Insta because my girlfriend wants me to? Should I just leave?","It can be tempting to unfollow girls you know on Instagram simply because your girlfriend asks you to, but resist the urge. Unfollowing these girls could lead to negative feelings and resentment, which will only damage your relationship. Talk to your girlfriend about why you're considering unfollowing these girls, and figure out a way to handle the fallout together."
"214","My bf lied to me about something small and now I’m questioning everything","Me (26f) and my bf (28m) have been together almost 2 years. For a long time I always thought he was being honest with me, because he is a pretty blunt guy. A lot of what he has told me has been backed up by stories from other people. I do notice he embellishes stories sometimes, but when I pay attention to other people I notice they do too. I think it’s a natural human thing to a certain degree.The other day, we had a storage container in our yard that a couple things were stolen from. I was upset. I remember he was in there the night prior, and I saw the lock in the garage. I asked him after we noticed things were missing if he had locked it that night, and he said yes. But how would have anyone gotten in? Also, I saw the lock in the garage. So I told him I didn’t think he did, and he admitted he didn’t. I said he told me he locked it so when I report the stolen info in the claim it sounds more concrete.I’m just so bothered he lied. Why not be open about it. I told him how much that bothered me and he initially went on to ask if I had ever told him a lie? Like he is saying it’s okay if it’s harmless at times.Have I ever lied to me bf? I’ve told him I’ve worked out at home on a day I didn’t, because I was feeling lazy. That’s it. So I don’t know.Anyways, I’m wondering how big of a red flag this is. He eventually apologized and said he should’ve been just honest from the start. Thoughts? TDLR: my bf lied to me about something small and I feel uncomfortable about it","If your partner has lied to you about something small, it might be tempting to question your entire relationship. However, it's important to keep in mind that there may be a valid explanation for the lie. If you can't come to an agreement about what happened, it might be helpful to seek professional help."
"215","Not being able to say no","I have had an issue with saying no just with this one friend. It feels like anytime I say no she has an alternative idea. For example: she texts me and asked me to take her to a store today and when I say no I’m going to my parents, she messages me back asking if she can come to my parents with me. I don’t know how to say no to this. I feel like it’s awkward to invite people over to your parents house when you don’t live there, I go to my parents house to visit my parents not to hang out with someone else while I am there. I don’t want to be rude. Even if I tell her I just don’t want to hang out today she will tell me something is happening where she needs to get out of the house immediately (she doesn’t have a car) and it just doesn’t seem real sometimes, because it happens so often. So I will constantly I’d be having her and her daughter over for hours till midnight because weird issues pop up. I have had a conversation with her about how me and my boyfriend don’t like having guests over that late, mainly because we need to get my kid to sleep at a reasonable hour. I feel like Im getting taken advantage of.","feeling like you have to agree to everything people ask of youbeing pressured to do something you don't want to dofeeling like you can't express your own views or opinionsfeeling like you have to take on too much responsibilitynot being able to leave work or responsibilities early because you're ""too busy"""
"216","I have big problems with social skills and communicating with strangers.","So, I'm 22 years old female and my whole teenage life from 11 to 21 years old my mother isolated me from the outside world because we lived out in the country (Before we lived in big cities and I had plenty of socializing and friends). I had no friends, NOONE to talk to but my mother, and even we didn't have much convo because she isn't on a friend level. From 11-13 I was still pretty normal, ate in front of her and wasn't that shy. Then as I got older it got so bad to the point I have huge trouble doing normal human things in front of her. Now I'm finally driving outside into town and I've lost all my confidence, all my social skills. I talk so quietly, I'm so nervous, when I need to go through an aisle and a person is standing in my way, I have trouble bringing myself to say ""excuse me"" or ""sorry"", I'm just so freaking shy and I know that it shows off as rudeness when in reality I've just lost all my confidence and social skills and how to communicate with people. I'm terrified of eating in front of other people, maybe partially because my mother would constantly be mad whenever I ate at home like it's a crime. I'm terrified of laughing out loud, I haven't had any human contact for a decade. No hugging, no handshakes, no touching. Nothing. I can't imagine myself dancing. I recently got into a gym and I'm TERRIFIED OF JOINING A FITNESS CLASS BECAUSE I HAVE TO DO STUFF IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE.","This is common, especially in adults. It can be tough to put yourself out there and start talking to new people. Sometimes it can feel like you’ll never be able to make friends or connect with other people.But you can overcome your social anxiety. There are a few things you can do to start building your social skills:1. Start with simple tasks.If you’re new to socializing, start by doing simple tasks like introducing yourself to someone at a party, or chatting with a co-worker about their day. This will help you get used to interacting with people and build confidence.2. Practice, practice, practice.If you’re really struggling with your social skills, try using a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter. This will give you a chance to talk to people in a more informal setting. Practicing your social skills will also help you to remember the tips you’ve learned.3. Set realistic expectations.When you’re starting out, it’s important to have realistic expectations. Don’t expect to be able to be friends with everyone you meet, or to know everything about them. Just take the time to get to know them and develop a friendship.4. Talk to your Doctor.If you’re still struggling to build your social skills, consider speaking with your doctor. They may be able to recommend some therapy or counseling to help you."
"217","Abusive grandfather doesn't have a life insurance policy, help.","Hey there. I live with my grandparents, and my grandpa is emotionally and verbally abusive. He is also a sexual deviant. He's almost hit us before, but has never gone through with it except one time where he tackled me in his underwear. His name is Gordon. Gordon is overweight and has heart disease. He's also just a generally sickly person. I don't think he is going to live very long. This would be very exciting if it weren't for the fact that he makes up the majority of my family's income. Both him and my grandma are retired, so if he died my grandma would inherit his 'salary'. If this happens we won't be able to live on just his salary alone. We are already poor as is, so with just one income we may be homeless. Anyway, I'm hoping that if he took out a life insurance policy that we'd have enough money to grt back up on our feet if he passee away. Unfortunately, he is yet to do so. I'm afraid that if we ask him he will think we want to kill him, and will kill us first. We have nowhere to go, especially since I have a lizard and my grandma would never go to a shelter.What do I do?","If your grandfather can't afford to have life insurance, it's possible that he doesn't have a policy at all. If this is the case, he may be at risk if he dies. You can try to get him to purchase a policy, or reach out to an insurance agent to see if they can help him find a policy that meets his needs."

I am an 18m, Ive had a girlfriend once (for about a month in HS). I was young for my grade and I am not a part time college student, but I also work many days. I apologize for including so much about my life, but I feel its relevant to understand my issue. Heres the thing. when you here of a dude saying ""I cant ever get a girlfriend"" what comes to mind? Maybe a dude who never takes care of himself sitting on xbox with an unshaven beard? Maybe somebody with no aspirations or they just dont care enough about finding one? I like to consider myself decently looking, Im a more slender guy but Im also 6'1 so my frame is taller, I shave daily and try to take care of myself, I have a decent amount of $ saved for my age, so that isnt an issue. I rarely get approached by girls, I have 0 confidence, I always feel like \*theres another guy\* whos better than me, wo why would I have a chance? Im pissed at myself, I have friends who fit my first decsription yet they have girlfriends, so what am I doing wrong? I took a week off work and went to myrtle beach this past week, walked around the city and saw hundreds if not thousands of similar aged girls, how many did I talk to? 0, and I hyped myself up thinking ""maybe this is a chance to meet someone"". I try to be honest with myself in this post, Im not chase stokes or chris hemsworth, but Im not exactly ""ugly"".. at least I dont think. Am I looking at this the wrong way? My life has become increasingly lonely, I feel everyone around me thinks Im a big shot, Im pretty pysically fit, I have a stable job at 18, Im in school, my parents have $, I have plans and goals for the future, but here I am with 0 confidence in ever finding a girlfriend. I dont get it, feel free to really give me a reality check in the comments, this is just how I look at things but clearly its not working. Maybe Im overselling myself, I have had girls interested in me, but I dont see anything in them, I fall for the prettiest girls despite knowing I will not be able to talk or date them.","There are a million reasons why someone may not be able to get a girlfriend, and none of them are specific to you. Some people may not be as outgoing as others, or may not have the same interests as many other people. However, it is important to remember that there are plenty of other people out there who would love to be in a relationship with you, and you should not give up on finding someone to share your life with just because you are having difficulty finding the right person. If you are finding it difficult to initiate relationships or to build trust with potential partners, be patient and focus on building better social and communication skills."
"219","I’m SO confused by the girl I’m talking to","I go to college with this girl and things have been going well. She hit on me a bit for the first time about two weeks ago and has always waited for me at the end of class since. Early on I got her number and texted her and asked her out. The first time I asked her she said she wanted to but was out of state for that week, and the second time I asked (this week) she didn’t respond when I asked after multiple days. I thought I maybe went in too hard or maybe said something— and that was probably it for us. However, yesterday (fri) I receive a text from her saying she’s super upset with herself (three days after texting her) for not getting back to my text. What do I make of this? Why would she make this problem? I’m so confused by it because of how easily avoidable this whole problem was. If she was busy or something, why wouldn’t she just respond in a normal timely manner with some reason like “hey, I’m totally swamped rn w work, I’ll lyk”. Why did she let the msg sit for so long and make a problem where there wasn’t one— and then apologize for doing it? Was she just trying to start drama? I genuinely have no idea, and the more I think ab it, the less sense it makes.","There’s a good chance that you’re not actually speaking to a girl, but to a computer.

I made sure to leave the fair I was attending early to be able to drive the hour home and my husband be on time to meet his friends.

A couple of weeks later I noticed her udder was enlarged and hard. I took her to the vet and they treated her for mastitis, with an antibiotic shot. They said it should start to improve within a few days. It has gotten worse. If her udder gets any larger it probably split open. I have tried everything I could find on the internet. I have tried warm compresses, peppermint udder lotion, milking her, MastoBlast (homeopathic mastitis treatment), and Tomorrow intramammary antibiotics. Nothing has helped, they just keep getting larger and harder. When milking her, all that comes out is a clear fluid, with no chunks, blood, or stringy stuff. I'm vegan and have no idea what to do with the milk.I called the vet again today, they stated the antibiotic injection is the only thing they can do for her other than a mastectomy. A mastectomy!?!?!? I can't imagine the trauma that will cause Amy, myself, and my daughter. I am a nurse and I'm not afraid of caring for sick animals, but a post-op barnyard animal?

This has been happening for the past week or so and she's been here a month, I'm not sure if it shows shes comfortable with me or she's into me. Every time she cuddles with me she's been wearing just panties and a baggy shirt or a 2 piece set of pijamas. I'm not sure if this is like a form of ""Teasing"" or this is just how she is sleeping. Sometimes she'll kiss me on the forehead or neck if I'm already asleep.I'm not sure if she's actually into me or its like a copeing mechanism for some trauma she has but I always reciprocate and cuddle back with her and I'm just really confused on what to do and how to help.","This could mean a few things. It could mean that your cousin is comfortable enough with you that she feels comfortable cuddling and sharing a bed with you.

This takes up about 4 months of their time total and they go to it every day during the week after school until around 6 pm and usually Saturdays, too. I've had to option to join it with them and almost did once before, but my schedule is too busy and it stressed me out too bad so I stopped being a part of it.Now, when I said all my friends are in theater, I mean ALL my friends, they're really all the people who I talk to.

"224","How to deal with a roommate that hogs the common area?","Hey everyone, so I have a roommate who is constantly out on the couch in the common area (the couch belongs to the landlord not him), every single night he is seemingly guarding the front door.  He even brough out his own TV to the common area after some other roommates left and took their TV which he would still hog without their consent.  Every single time I pass through after work he is way too chatty, or if he sees a bag in my hand he stares at it and wants to know what's in it and asks if I brought him anything.  Lately, I've been getting a little smart mouth'ed with him to get him to back off but that seems to be doing nothing.  So the only thing that really seems plausible is to talk to him and let him know that whatever passes through isn't his unless otherwise announced on the whiteboard in the common area since that would be something I want to share with everyone.  Yes there's a whiteboard in the kitchen which shows who owes rent and any other announcements.  I have nothing against sharing but it should be assumed that when I don't have an announcement to make, that whatever passes through the front door is my property.  How would you handle such a situation?  It seems to be affecting everyone here, no one is out in the common area unless they have to, people cook less often, because this roommate is out there 100% of the time.  To add fuel to the fire he hasn't even paid rent for 2 months, the land lord is way too considerate with him about rent, this roommate even took a trip to Cambodia and used what would have been rent money to go there, and he hasn't paid the landlord since.  I feel bad for his elementary school aged son who he brings over from his divorced wife from time to time, because he has him sit on the couch all day with him and feeds him junk food.  I can kind of see why the wife left him.","There are a few things that you can do in order to deal with a roommate that hogs the common area. You can politely ask them to stop, or you can try to put a boundary in place yourself. You can say that you would like to use the area for specific purposes, like studying or working, and that they should not interrupt your time. You could also try to discuss the issue with them, and see if they are willing to change their behavior. If they are not willing to change, then you may need to consider moving out."

"226","My sister (19F) confessed to me about her Suicidal Thoughts","I (15F) need help on what steps to take next. My sister recently took a plan B after a condom broke when she was doing it with a dude(27M) (idk if they are official) after this point she’s been really suicidal and self harming. She told me this also happened to her after trying birth control. The dude said he’d be there for my sister but has actually been ignoring her lately . I let her know that I’m always there for her no matter what she chooses to do and the dude isn’t worth all of this worry along with she can always come to me when he’s being an ass. Problem is my parent aren’t on the best of term with my sister. She still lives at home and has a trend of toxic guys in her life. I want to help her get therapy somehow but I promised not to tell my parent about the who suicidal thing. My mom said she’d be willing pay for therapy once (idk if she meant it) and I don’t know about my dad. Should I go tell my parent the full story to try and get her help?Please I need help with this.","My sister (19F) came to me with some suicidal thoughts she's been having lately. She's been feeling really down and hopeless, and she thinks about ways she could end her life. She's been to the emergency room twice in the past month because she was having trouble breathing, and she's been getting really stressed out about school and her future. She's never talked about wanting to die before, but she's been feeling really suicidal lately.I recommend that my sister talk to her doctor or mental health professional about her thoughts of suicide and how to deal with her feelings. She could also consider talking to a peer support group or talking to a therapist on her own. Talking to someone can help her deepen her understanding of her thoughts and feelings, and can help her find ways to cope."
"227","How to cut contact with my ex gently","TW - suicideWe went low contact after we broke up last April. Tried fixing things and they didn’t work. In November we starting talking again and in December we had plans to go on a date after Christmas as we where both busy.She called things off again near the end of January which hurt as the week prior we did have plans to meet but she ‘forgot’ about the plans.Then we had an argument and she said terrible things about me and about how she wanted me gone when we broke up which honestly confused me since she’s the one that reached out to me.Since that argument things have been bad. She constantly sends me snaps to keep our snap streak going regardless of us losing it. I’ve constantly told her to stop and to leave me alone and would’ve removed her but I’m scared to remove her as when we had last talked without arguing she admitted feeling suicidal.I finally snapped and told her to either talk to me about the argument or to leave me alone for good to which she revealed one of her family members is dying and she’s not in a good place and asked for space before we spoke about that argument.I told her I’m sorry for what she’s going through and I expected the snaps to stop. But nope, still constant daily snaps. I just want her to leave me alone but I am worried about her especially during this time and feel like an asshole asking her to stop snapping me. I don’t mind if she needs someone to talk to but I need space from her after everything.Any advice to gently go low contact with her.","There is no one definitive answer to this question, as everyone's experience of breaking up may be quite different. However, some tips on how to cut contact with your ex gently may include:1. Trying to be as sensitive as possible when breaking the news.2. Avoid sending mixed signals.3. avoiding sending too much emotional information through communication.4. Being honest and truthful about your intentions.5. Avoid making assumptions or taking the blame for the break-up.6. Appreciating and respecting your ex's feelings."
"228","I don’t like my partners best friend and I don’t like hearing about them. Any advice?","My partners best friend is someone he really gets on with and feels like he can talk to and I have appreciated when he’s been there to make him feel heard. Having said that whenever I used to see his best friend when we’d go to his or when he was there with his friends he’d always ask me intrusive questions. When I say this he would always say some story about how his friend was in a toxic relationship and they stop their partner spending money or seeing friends. He’d then always ask me questions like do you do that? What do you think about your partners spending habits? I always felt like I had to explain myself to him even though I don’t control my partner.He would then always ask me why did your partner go to see me? When did he get back? When did he go? He’d always ask me these three questions out of earshot of my partner I always answers as I felt intimidated. This got to a point where I couldn’t take it anymore I felt like he thought I was controlling my partner even though I wasn’t. I don’t force him to be in a relationship with me or come and see me. The constantly asking why made me feel as if it was unfathomable that someone would want to see me and spend time with me. I felt so low about myself like I was this evil person who was forcing my partner to see me. I told my partner and his friend said it was a joke. I then said it’s not a joke it makes me feel rubbish. I then asked my partner to tell his friend from me to stop asking me because it made me feel uncomfortable. I asked as my partner said he’d talk to him but it felt like he wasn’t making it a priority. His friend said that he was sorry and that was it.Now my partner keeps singing his praises and talking about him and it’s really upsetting me. What do I do? This is his best friend but it makes me uncomfortable. Any advice?

If you disapprove of your partner's friend, it may be best to avoid discussions or conversations about them altogether. Alternatively, it may be helpful to approach the situation with an open mind and try to understand why your partner enjoys talking about their friend - after all, they may have a lot of positive things to say. Ultimately, it is important to listen to your feelings and make decisions based on what is best for you."
"229","Should I just ditch everyone and hang out on my own?","So last night I was invited over to friend’s house. My other  friend and I haven’t been over to see them in like 2 months. Where as before it was usually once or twice a month and at some point 3 or 4 times a week. This has caused issues hurt feeling etc but the main reason is because the guy who invites us over only does it at like 9 at night when he’s wasted. Usually by that time we already have plans or have decided to stay in for the night. I also work a 9-5. Anyway last night my other friend who I live with was working late and I was trying to get a hold of him to ask if he wanted to go to their house. I said I was feeling up to it even though it was night but it was Friday night so I was off the next day. A whole group chat message exchange happened within that hour where the guy who invited us said he was tired and decided not to. I had already gotten ready and had just locked the door to my house to go over. Glad it was before I was on my way. So then my friend got off work finally and said he wanted to go but they already cancelled so to speak. So this afternoon Saturday.  I had plans to hang out with my best friend who I live with .He said we were hanging out this Saturday. So the other two guys who had invited us to the house last night texted both of us to hang out today. So I text my best friend and he tells me that he is actually out of town partying but will be back at 7. Like I believe that. So now they are asking me to hang out with them. I am very fed up with people making plans and cancelling them or making me feel expendable . I am very tempted to just Uber somewhere alone and drink. But I am female and I’ve really never gone out drinking by myself before. I’m always with my best friend. But I want to go out .","That’s not a good idea. Ditching your friends can feel really lonely, and it’s not good for your mental or physical health. You’ll also miss out on important social and emotional support."

He basically treats me like a FWB despite calling me his GF and introducing me to friends and family. It's possible we are just mismatched. Mutual friends were surprised when we got together. One litreally said ""but you're so warm and he's so independent....I never saw it coming"". He never wants to soend time with me. He rarely brings me on dates as simple as a walk or coffee or the cinema. Yesterday we were both off work and college and he spent the whole day with a new female friend and I started crying after a few drinks over it. He then said I was controlling and not letting him have female friends, when the reality is idgaf. I just assumed we would hang together as he said we would a few days prior AND they went to the cinema together the night before AND they went for coffee, to a bar and then the cinema on our day off.

"231","I think I had some sort of anxiety attack during school???","TW for self harm, mentioned.&#x200B;I don't know what happened to me, but I was taking an exam for a language class. I was doing the work, and I had to answer the questions in said language. I felt like I had the answers, but I couldn't process them. I felt all weird. I kinda remember gasping a little? And I was trying to snap out of it, so I started digging the pencil into my hand but that didn't work either. I couldn't think. I spent like a good forty minutes just…off. I kept trying to scratch at myself and pull my hair to get back to normal. I couldn't write down the answers, and I was getting more and more stressed because everyone else was finishing. The teacher came over to me to see what was taking me so long, but I couldn't explain, I could barely even speak. She just ended up pointing out what was already wrong on my sheet and leaving. And then five minutes before the class ended I managed to snap out of it some and didi the entire worksheet, I turned it in just as the bell rang. And it took me like a half hour to get fully back to normal, I was all shaky and I felt like I couldn't speak properly. Everything was too loud and too bright. I have no idea what the frick happened. Recently I've been feeling a bit anxious, maybe that was it? I have no idea. Does anyone know?","There are a variety of reasons why someone might experience an anxiety attack during school, including feeling overwhelmed or stressed.

They are focused on university, while I’m not sure about what to do in my future, also I’m the only one that doesn’t have a girlfriend in our group. I’m gonna say that i’m mentally younger than them. If we go out (key word is IF, because they always prefer going out with their girlfriends and leave me alone) the only thing they want to do is going to get a drink and don’t move for 3 hours while talking about politic and economy, while I don’t even have the knowledge to say my opinion in those topics. I would like to do normal things for our age like partying or similar things, but this is impossible since they don’t want. This is destroying me since I have 0 possibilities of making new friends and I feel like I’m wasting my 20s. I don’t even know if I can call the current ones “friends” since i don’t even speak with them via message, unless I’m the first to write (and I also wait 7/8 hours before getting and answer). I don’t know what to do, since as I mentioned earlier I can’t make new friends because of the fact that I don’t go to university and work in a job which doesn’t give me the opportunity of knowing new people of my age. I’m a failure in every aspect of life, at this point I think I’m going to die alone or unhappy, or both things.","Perhaps you are not compatible with your friends.

"233","SIL did something at our kid’s birthday party last year, don’t want to have the same problem this year","Last year, we threw a birthday party for my oldest daughter. Every year we always give the kids the choice of a Disneyland trip or a party for their birthdays. They always choose Disney, but this last year my daughter wanted a party.We were still recovering from a difficult financial year so we threw a small party. We invited all of his family (a lot of cousins aunts uncles and kids) but it was a pink princess theme. SIL showed up with a gift for her son and a cake that said “Happy Birthday (her son’s name).” She chose that moment to tell me it’s also her son’s birthday and she wanted the kids to share the party. I didn’t say anything but it bothered me. I can’t talk to her about it because of the language barrier and i don’t want to ask my boyfriend (technically we’re not married and never will be, but we’ve built a family and a life together) to talk to her because i don’t want to strain their relationship. We decided this year to throw one big party for my oldest daughter and son instead of 2 small parties. This will be the first party in the family that will be at a party place instead of someone’s backyard. I’m spending $500 for the food and the space, which has all those special bounce castles. I don’t want to run into the same issue as last year but I can’t just not invite them. I would be willing to share the party for the 3 kids if she split the cost with me, but she won’t want to. What’s the best way to approach this?","If SIL did something at your child's birthday party last year, we recommend reaching out to them to ensure that they are aware of any specific details or concerns you may have about this year's party. They may be able to provide guidance or assistance in planning a similar party that meets your family's needs and expectations, while still keeping in mind the SIL values and philosophy."

I graduated secondary school in 2022 and took a gap year to work and do some practical courses and the guy I've gotten to know is still in 5th year in secondary school. He was held back a year because of his dyslexia and I graduated a year early at 17 because I skipped TY.The issue I have is that while we're the same age, the academic age gap is 2 years and I feel that as your social circle changes, so does your level of maturity and I can't shake the feeling of being a creep for talking to someone in fifth year while I myself have been graduated.Some of my friends have said it's weird, some said that it doesn't really matter since we're the same age.

"236","The dark side of being friends with (some ) benefits","I don’t really know how to describe but there’s this girl(30)and there’s me (33). And our friendship is exhausting me. She is the kind of extra attentive to her body and aesthetic while I am a pretty normal guy.I have always knew she were in a long term relationship and she still is. She is my friend, and some months ago, seemed interested in me by texting me everyday. At this point I confronted her about her feelings and said she really didn’t see me more than a friend. I moved on and cleared the situation with her but we still texted everyday all day long. Until one day she jumped on me and kissed me like 15 min straight. She said she enjoyed it but not to try getting sentimentally involved because she has a boyfriend already. At this point she almost stopped texting me because “it looked like a relationship and that was weird weird”. Months later, I have seen her again. We didn’t have an intercorse but kissed for at least 1 hour I think. Next day she said, again,she doesn’t have feelings for me. And sent me a lingerie pic. I appreciate her being honest and all but at this point I think I want to stop being her attention toy if she really doesn’t feel anything for me. There’s not even this much benefits(and I don’t care). I would appreciate an advice on how to get out of this and if I should try talking again or it’s pointless. Don’t want to ruin the friendship tho. Thanks","Some benefits of being friends with someone can be that they can provide support when times are tough. Additionally, they may be able to offer advice and tips that can be beneficial in your life. However, while being friends with someone may be beneficial, it can also have its drawbacks. For example, if someone is toxic and negative, it can be hard to avoid them and they may be a heavy drain on your energy. Additionally, if someone is dishonest or manipulative, they can use your friendship to get what they want. Thus, it is important to be aware of the potential dark side of being friends with someone in order to protect yourself."
"237","What do I do with my life?","Sorry, loaded asl question but let me make the situation more clear. I’m 17, graduated a year early but for the past 4 months I’ve been out of school I’ve made no developments whatsoever in my life. I yearn for success but feel as though I have no drive.I 100% have decision fatigue / choice overload. I have a supportive parent and did well in school so it’s not like I have a small pool of options… I have EVERY option.My heart and my brain are in 2 different places aswell. I would love to be a creative, I love analysing all pieces of media I intake and thinking about how I would do something if I was in the creatives shoes. Especially film, there’s something so mesmerising about the idea of working on a set with people just as enthused as I am about creating something for others. 1000% in the screenwriting department, I’ve always loved writing.I’ve also thought about game design, for a lot of the same reasons but creating something interactive has a whole different charm to it. My logic however keeps repeating the same things to me though, that creative careers are very dependent on luck. The idea of taking a ‘leap of faith’ is mortifying. I don’t want to jump into a life decision without having any bearing on the outcome. I don’t want to be someone who tried and failed, having something I’m passionate about be just seen as a silly hobby that didn’t work out. My grades in school pretty much allow me to get any degree I want at uni so I could slot into something that pays well- but I despise the idea of my profession being something I don’t enjoy. I know that ‘it’s normal to dislike your job’ but I don’t want to live like that, especially since I’ve been given the opportunities I have. But it would be the easy choice.There’s things I enjoy that don’t involve creativity either- I’m good with computers and enjoy learning more about the machines so I could do something that works with either the software or hardware of PC’s. I also just enjoy learning in general, I’ve always been weirdly curious about degrees in marine biology, sexual health and gender studies. I could become some type of academic? I could go into more detail but I’ll spare everyone the time. I just don’t know what to do with myself.","This is a difficult question. You may feel like you want to do something with your life, or you may not know what you want to do. It can be difficult to figure out what to do with your life when you don't have any clear goals or ideas. It can be helpful to think about your personal values and how you want to live your life. You may also want to consider what you would be good at and how you could use your skills and abilities to help others. Once you have a good idea of what you want to do, you can start to think about how to get there. There are lots of different ways to get started, and there is no one path that is perfect for everyone. You can explore different options and see what is best for you.

I work hard for my money (construction) and on weekends I wish I can go do something to talk to girls but there’s never opportunity. Bars and clubs seem to be options but I have nobody that ever wants to go because 2 of my main friends have girlfriends and the other few don’t like going out and going out by myself is weird. I have friends right now who cheat on their girlfriends all the time (I told them I don’t like that and warned them many times it’s not cool but they never listened). It hurts me cause I was so loyal in my last relationship and got fucked over yet people out there treat girls like shit and still have a relationship. I’m a very loyal guy who wants real love and doesn’t do hookups but I have no clue what to do anymore. Seems like ppl now in days don’t want anything serious. I want another girlfriend but I barely  get opportunities and when I do it goes nowhere.

"242","Mood killer: My partner blames herself for everything and I am ill","Life is exquisitely tattered. My partner is the most loving soul that I have met. Her intent is always genuine and she is kind, generous and loving. I am a blessed man. We have lived together for 4 years.We lost two cats this past year. She grieved so deeply.  Her process opened my eyes to how deeply she feels. I am now ill. She feels everything is her fault. I had asked for things in the beginning of the relationship that never came to fruition. Some of these things have affected my health but I wouldn’t change a thing. I see her value and for that matter the value of all life because of her. I don’t want her holding onto that guilt.I asked her if I passed could she please not hold onto any of that guilt. I do not want to die worrying if she will be ok. She said she can’t promise me that. What am I supposed to do here? I don’t want to cause her pain.I think we could both use some counselling. I probably will not respond much to this and just take in what you have to say in. I’m not looking for attention just a little help if you have it in you."," equipped to deal with her miseryThe mood killer in this scenario is the partner's self-blaming. The partner is generating a lot of negative energy, which is negatively impacting the relationship. Additionally, the partner is not able to cope with the negative energy and feels overwhelmed.

"243","How can I help my depressed younger sibling?","My sibling has had mood problems since their teens. They are the baby of the family and grew up physically and emotionally attached to our mother. They were a very outgoing and smiley kid. When they hit their teens they started becoming very stressed during exam periods and would cry and shout to my mother until my mother would soothe them. The rest of the time they would be fine and very outgoing and charismatic. My sibling has lots of friends who cares about them. My sibling did well in college and now works for my dads firm. They were very close to my dad and my dad pressured them to go into the same field as them. Last year my parents divorced. We found out my dad had a 2-year long affair and we found out we had a half sibling. My parents fought a lot and my mother decided to divorce my dad. My dad became incredibly emotionally abusive and we found out he had been gaslighting my mother for years. My dad basically divorced us kids too and quickly left the country.My sibling has shut down. They have maybe 1-2 good days a month where they’re super happy and outgoing but most of the time they’re in their room and don’t talk to my mother or our other sibling. They have expressed that they’re depressed, have nothing to live for and feel hopeless. My mother and I have suggested on many occasions they get help but they refuse it. They also get angry quite easily if we say the wrong thing. Their friends have visited and tried to hold an intervention with no success.  I am ready to do research and pay for therapy, psychiatry, anything but they are not interested at all. This is making my mother depressed too so every time I visit my family home I’m having to cheer my mother up. I hate seeing her blame herself for my siblings mental health. I don’t know what to do. I struggle to understand my sister sometimes. I’m also really hurt by my dads behavior and suffer from depression but I’ve always got help for it. I don’t know why they have given up on themselves. I want them to fight for their happiness but I don’t know how. I love them so much and I don’t want them to be depressed for the rest of their lives. Any advice would be appreciated","talk to them and let them know they are not alone, be there for them, listen to them, offer support, be empathetic, give them a hug, do things together"

I’m well aware of what Lucid dreaming is and how it works. When i was younger i accidentally found out how to lucid dream on my own. But what i experienced tonight is something ive never heard of… and it terrifies me. Tonight was a mixture of sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming for hours whilst contantly waking up and slipping back in and out of reality whilst being held down by my own body. Constantly blipin from one dream to another with 0 corralation and all I remember is punching some wooden esk man. He said “please wait” and me being scared shitless i swung without remorese.This is not the first time this has happened to me, falling asleeping nowing im going to experience these hyper real hallucinations.

Usually centred around me trying to just figure out how to wake up. Im always being spoken to but never remember what is being said. Lastly ive woken up crying, uncontrollably- tears are just flooding out. Im not sad or anything, i live a very happy and fruitful life and im very lucky to be where i am. So why is this happening to me.

If you can't stop thinking about these things, it can be difficult to get to sleep. You might also have trouble sleeping if you are feeling stressed or anxious. If you can't get to sleep, make sure to try some relaxation techniques or try to relax in bed before you go to sleep."

I have sole custody and his father isn't involved at all.Yesterday my son had a school play and his best friend, James, was in the play too. Alex and James always play together during the weekends. I'll take them to different places, James will spend the night at our place and vice versa. After the play concluded, I ran into James' mom who stated she'd had a rough day and needed a break. I suggested we send the kids home with her husband and she and I could go out and blow off some steam. We shuffled the kids around and off we went for a St. Pat's extravaganza. Over a few drinks, James' mother tells me that she thought I was Alex's older sister who has been caring for him. Alex told James his ""mom died months ago""...... But here I am, alive and well....How do I approach this situation? I did go through a fairly large trauma a few years ago, and I haven't been the same since. Could my son be referring to the old me dying? Is it just a harmless lie? My feelings are hurt, because I do the best I can, but my son is telling people I'm dead. Where do I go from here?","This could go in a number of different directions. It could be that your child has been feeling really sad lately and their best friend came over to try and comfort them. In this case, it's very possible that your child may have told their friend that you are no longer with them. However, it's also possible that your child has simply been sharing stories with their best friend and didn't actually say you were dead. If you would like to talk to your child about what happened and determine what actually happened, you can do so in a non-judgmental way. It's also important to remind your child that they can always come talk to you if they feel like they're in any trouble."

"249","How to handle a roommate who thinks he knows the best?","I (24) and my roommate (23M) applied for the same job. I got in after all rounds but he didn't. He was fine. One day we were talking about something after a really bad day at work. I told him about how hard it was to keep up. And he just casually told me it's because I haven't struggled at all in my life. The difference between us is that he has done all household chores and I haven't done any. I come from an underprivileged brown family who struggled to find a foothold in society and thought that only way possible would be through a good education. They wouldn't let me do anything other than that and that took a toll on my mental health. On the other hand his family never cared about education and things like that. He has a few gap years. They are much better in the society and wealthier than us. He hasn't struggled a day in his life financially whereas my parents on the other hand struggled with my fees. Whenever he gets better grades than me he wouldn't stop talking about it for hours. But I never once ruined that for him because I know he likes when people look up to him. I worked really hard for this job and he tells me that straight to my face. I still don't go off. I just told him simply that no one does that work since they were toddlers, we all are just newbies in corp life and gotta learn while working. And he says ""Yeah! I can't even get my point across because you think that you shouldn't listen from someone who doesn't even do that."" And walked away. I just felt really bad and didn't say anything. But he gets manipulated really easily like if he spends a day with you he will only look at it from your side. I try telling him to not do that. But he just believes I'm the jealous one here. I can't seem to handle it we'll. It's taking a toll on me. And really need to clear air between us.","Handle it diplomatically.

"250","How do I tell my parents I want to switch schools?","Hello, I am 14m and am almost finished with my freshman year at a private school. I got to go there because my dad works there and I was able to get a huge discount on the tuition. However, the school is a nightmare and my dad interfering with my life there makes it so much worse. First, the people there are all so mean and spoiled brats. What’s worse, they are the kind of people who act so nice in front of teachers and other people but are cruel when there is no one around. I have had pens thrown at me, yelled at walking in the hall, and just generally been subjected to mean conditions. Secondly, I hate how the school curriculum is structured. The grading scale is 1–7, and I can’t even begin to explain how much homework I have. I’m up until 2–3 a.m. most nights and my parents just say I need to manage my time better. Im constantly stressed and never have time to do stuff I like, like going to the gym, playing piano, etc. Thirdly, my dad completely interferes with my life and work. I am seen as the teacher’s kid. Additionally, he started working at the school where he wanted me to go just so he could oversee me. I have no freedom and I feel suffocated. Lastly, it’s just so small. There are 28 people in my whole grade, and I can’t make friends because everyone has already decided they don’t like me. All of them have been going to school with each other for years, (it’s a K-12 school), and they ganged up on me immediately from the first day. I just really believe that I could do better at another school. One where being new isn’t treated as a crime, and one where I can learn without worrying about how late I have to stay up.Any advice is welcome, thank you!","If you want to switch schools, you can either talk to your parents about it or ask your new school if you can switch."

I used to have a big secure friend group but the past 2 years Ive been getting more and more distant from them. I went through a pretty rough patch, having an ED and being depressed. I also got into a relationship end of 2020 which led me to spend less quality time with my friends. i still see them kind of regularly (once a week or every 2 weeks) but the intimacy is just not there anymore. I see them posting stories without me regularly and having like at home friend nights but i’m only ever invited to parties or nights out and i only see like 2 friends privately just the two of us. One of them has been my best friends for 14 years but she’s been making new friends and deeper connections with other people and i feel like i’m just not as important anymore, probably because i was away for so long due to my new relationship and mental health issues. I feel myself longing for new friendships (not cutting ties with my old ones though) and just going out more and having deeper connections with other people. I used to be very outgoing but i feel like covid kinda ruined my social skills. i also think it’s important to note that i graduated in 2020 so i’m 21 now and i guess this is just the time in someone’s life where a lot of stuff changes. Plus, my relationship has been a roller coaster (on/off, lots of fighting) the past year and i think that contributed to the distance as wellEDIT: a big factor too i think is that my 5 closest friends moved in together ( not all five at once but 2 live together and the other three live together) I was supposed to move in with the 2 as well but life got in the way and i didn’t have a stable job after school to move out. I just feel lonely and I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience in their life and how they got through it. any help would be very much appreciated <3","It is hard to deal with losing friends, but it is important to remember that friends come and go and it is ok to move on.

"257","Difficult situation","TW; SUICIDAL THOUGHTS MENTIONED For context, I'm still in high school. So I have a partner that I've been with for 3 months and they are very sweet but I think we need to break up. They don't really talk to me a lot, don't try to invite me to things when our friend groupmakes plans but doesn't invite me, I'm the only one who tries to make plans to hang out after school, and they said I love you very fast. I do love them but I think in a more platonic way. They keep saying that we have so many good memories together but truth is we barely do so I'm really confused as to what they're thinking. Our conversations just feel really dry and they are significantly more affectionate towards our friends. I just don't think I'm allowed to break up with them. They recently said ""i don't think i could live without you"" which was really out of the blue and made me worry. They have struggled with suicidality for a while and I'm worried if I break up with them they'll commit. I don't want then to hurt themselves or worse. When I was trying to figure out if they were okay one time after they had a hard day I told them that I trusted them and they could trust me and I'd listen. They said they trusted me more than anyone and with their life. It's just that we hadn't been together super long. But even if we break up and my partner is physically okay, all of my friends will leave because they have more loyalties to my partner. I have literally been told that ""you guys aren't allowed to break up"" or ""if you hurt them I'll kill you"" ""itll be really awkward for me if you guys break up"" I understand the I'll kill you one is most likely just them being protective but still. They also say that my partner talks about me (in a positive way) but I feel like my partner rarely expresses any of that affection to me. I feel like such an asshole and I'm so stressed about it. My own mental health has never been great and this is making it way worse. I don't want my partner to commit, lose all of my friends, or both. What can I do? If I should break up with them is there a way that won't make them feel more suicidal?TL;DR How to break up with a suicidal person without making them want to commit?","I'm not sure how to approach this situation.

"258","I’m jealous of my girlfriend’s cousin","So I (21 F) have a girlfriend who is 23, we’ve been dating for 3 years. I have been very jealous of her cousin since I met her and I’m not sure what to do with the feelings I’m having. Basically the reason I’m jealous is entirely on my girlfriend’s part. I do really like the cousin. I guess I’m worried deep down that she likes her cousin because she’s so weirdly possessive over her. I went on their two week family beach vacation last year for the first time, and the entire two weeks from the moment we woke up, to the moment we went to bed we would be with her cousin, because she refused to be apart from her. She does live in another state, so she says that’s the reason she does it. But to me it seems weird that she doesn’t want ANY alone time with me on vacation. I remember I asked if we could have some time alone and she got so upset with me. Also the things she comments on her instagram make me uncomfortable, as they’re kinda sexual comments. But it’s brushed off as her just joking and being girls. I also have similar features as the cousin, and I remember when we first started dating and we were talking about our types, my girlfriend described her cousin perfectly. It’s just a lot of things that make me feel insecure and jealous. My girlfriend is also very jealous of her cousin’s boyfriend because he takes time away from her, and she got jealous when her cousin brought friends to vacations as well. I get that it’s probably just because they don’t see each other often, but I have this feeling that I’ll always be second to her cousin and it makes me sad. I want to have a talk with her about it, but I don’t want to have that conversation of accusing my girlfriend of having a crush on her cousin. But we have a family trip coming up in a week and I’m tired of feeling like I’m just following them around. Thoughts?","I'm not jealous of my girlfriend's cousin, but I do envy her because she has a really close relationship with her cousin."
"259","Should I take extra vacation days?","To give some background, I work in Engineering R&D. Recently work has been extremely busy with multiple projects and multiple tight deadlines. I'm part of R&D, and since the beginning of this year I've worked a lot of overtime, including several late nights and weekends collaborating with other engineers to meet a very high priority deadline and solving a critical issue. Management was extremely happy and we got congratulated. Since we don't get paid overtime (we're salaried) I asked my boss to give me an extra week paid time off on top of my regular vacation days to compensate for all the late nights. This was in late Feb. Although he approved it, we had another critical commitment the week of my request, so I got asked to postpone my holidays. I worked again to successfully meet the commitments and thought the world was calming down and decided to take a week off. Again, as fortune would have it, something critical popped up again and I spent the entirety of last week solving the problem with all hands on deck. Now I thought everything was actually good and I should be able to take my week off without any issues. So I booked my days, and returned home from work last night feeling relaxed. As fate would have it, I got messaged late last night with a request from a different team that we need to verify something critical and we only have a week. At this point I am having a breakdown because I'm extremely exhausted. I messaged my senior engineer to take care of this request if possible. He said he would look into it but didn't sound too happy about it. This whole situation has really been hurting my health both physically and mentally. I haven't been getting enough sleep and people tell me I look extremely exhausted. That's because I am! I'm handling multiple projects in parallel compared to other co-workers at my level. But taking this week off next week is making me feel extremely guilty, and am afraid that if shit hits the fan it will somehow be blamed on me. So I feel like I'll be unable to enjoy my week off. I'm considering postponing again but I am really really burnt out and need a recharge. So I guess I am asking for advice here. What do I do?","It is always a good idea to take a few extra vacation days in case of an emergency."
"260","Looking for options for our problematic farm dog","Hi all, I'm looking for a solution to an urgent situation with our farm dog.We have had this gorgeous, super smart but super sensitive english shepherd for two years and live in a semi-public setting (community farm with regular visitors). This dog can be the sweetest, loving-bordering-on-needy (hah) sweetheart, and he is very smart- he can learn tricks so fast and he loves to play frisbee. If he has a very attentive and clear handler, he is in his element. But he has not had a clear one person to work with and in our public environment he has gotten spooked/stressed and bit multiple people in completely unrelated events. A few bites were more minor but twice it was pretty bad and ended in a few stitches.We are at our unthinkable last options end. We have reached out to shelters and the breeder and still do not have a solution. We have arrived at the absolute last resort - to put him down.This is devastating, but we don't know what else to do and don't want more people in our environment to get harmed or feel unsafe.I think he would thrive in a quiet environment with one clear ""his person"" who is really wanting to work with him & lives on some land either alone or with one other person. At this point, I think he needs someone who has experience with dog behavior training or a specialist. If there is anyone who has advice in this situation or is interested in taking him, we have to make decisions within 48 hours.","We recommend checking out our article on farm dogs and how to train them."

Things started to dwindle last year. my partner attends university 3 hours away and so i visit every other week but its hard because they never have any money and its draining me. They depend on me financially alot and I have big dreams. I work full time and make good money but over the last year im eating into my savings and being drained, missing out on my goals of what i want to do. I want to invest my money and achieve other things but this always comes 2nd.I've started caring very little now, i feel myself getting annoyed when spending time together and wishing we were not. It's a shame because she's a really nice girl but she has 0 friends and her family is not great so i always have to miss out on what i want to do.All my hobbies have disappeared, she gets funny if i go out fishing because it means she has nothing to do, so recently we just sit inside and do nothing.I want to break up but I'm not sure how to do it, i'm to much apart of her family, in group chats, all relatives on socials i feel its gunna suck and it's gunna break her as im the only person she has which holds me back.I cannot see myself marrying this girl.Advice","If you are in a relationship and it is ending, here are some tips to help you go through the process:1. Listen to what your partner is saying and try to understand their feelings.2. Make sure that you are honoring your own feelings as well.3. Handle the break-up in a kind and respectful way.4.

"262","How do i politely turn down someone im not interested in?","For context im a 15(f) in highschool. Basically I told a friend of mine I found a someone attractive and the person ended up finding out. They already follow me on instagram, so a day later they ended up dm-ing me their number. I thought it was a bit much as I never explicitly stated I was interested in a relationship or anything of the sort. I am trying to focus on school at the moment.Now I know I should've stopped this at that point, but it didn't want to leave them on seen. So by my friend's advice I texted them hello and told them my name (of course.) They left me on delivered for the rest of the night.So my thought process was, ""Oh they probably just changed their mind. That's good. It works out."" But then they approached me the next day and gave me a weird excuse as to why they couldn't reply. I didn't think much of it. The following evening they spam text me off of their email and phone number asking if im interested and find them attractive, etc. I left them on delivered again as i felt the wording to be really weird and wasn't sure how to reply.Today they've just texted me, confrontational as to why I didn't reply. I KNOW i'm in the wrong and i'd like to fix it. I'm just non confrontational by nature and hate situations like this. Any advice?","There is no polite way to say ""no"" to someone who you are not interested in."
"263","Dealing with family rejection","Dealing with family dysfunction, shut down and rejection has been a long term struggle for me. I pretty much have little to no contact with any of my siblings or extended family. I wouldn’t say it’s by choice, rather the dynamic of my family. Most of my siblings have personal problems, deal with addiction and/or would just rather not have a relationship. This feeling of rejection is extremely painful for me. As I have struggled to make friends since moving during COVID and am often feeling very lonely. I reach out to my siblings and family members, mail gifts and try to show that they are important to me. Almost all of the time I am left on read, and never contacted back. I can call and leave messages, no one will call back.. ect That is unless there is a “family emergency”- in this case I am always contacted to help. Which I always do.. and it leaves me feeling overextended and used- as contact ends immediately after. This feeling of really being unwanted, and not needed in my family brings me so much mental agony. I cry often about it and just feel so alone. I guess I’m looking for some advice or insight if anyone else has struggled with this type of isolation. Thanks for any help","It can be difficult to deal with family rejection. It's a painful experience to feel like you're not wanted, and it can be hard to cope with feelings of rejection.There are a few things you can do to help manage the pain of family rejection.1.Talk about it. It's important to share your feelings with someone. Talking about how you're feeling can help you process the experience and feel less isolated.2.Find support. There are many resources available to help you cope with family rejection. You can talk to your friends or family members about what you're going through, or look for support groups or online resources.3.Express your gratitude. Despite the pain and upset you may be feeling, it's important to remember that family is important. Express your gratitude for the family you have and cherish the memories you have of them."
"264","Am I under social obligation to buy two chairs for my balcony?","I am still recovering from losing my family in 2021, and my cat and I have moved to an apartment building for people with disabilities or who are elderly (I am on disability and very poor.).  I really love it here, and I especially love that I can pay the bills here, without being in the red.  I have a very nice balcony on the seventh floor and am trying to get things for it, now that the weather is changing.  I looked at Walmart today, and I had an anxiety crisis at Walmart and left chairless.  The issue is that I really don't have a lot of money, and my choice is that I can either afford one nice chair that is really comfy, where I can sit outside with my cat and metabolize my vitamin D; or I can afford two plastic deck chairs that are pretty comfortable but not as good as the more expensive one (and the expensive one is pretty, while these are grey molded plastic).  I feel like I'm being a jerk if I just buy one chair though, because people will come over, and I will only have my own chair and nothing for them, and I am breaking some social contract.  But I also really want to just have a comfy chair that I can sit in and watch the sun rise, with my cat.  I wanted to hear the opinions of some people who don't find this to be an anxiety inducing, tear summoning conundrum to help me decide.  Thank you in advance for any help.","No, you are not obligated to purchase two chairs."
"265","How do I avoid hurting my best friend’s feelings?","As many of you know, the upcoming Mario movie is coming out soon and me and my best friend are both extremely excited for it. While some of my favorites include some of the older ones like Mario Galaxy and New Super Mario Bros, his favorite is Mario Odyssey. We played it together for about 3 hours one time, and I’ve even played some of it on my own a couple of times, and it’s not my cup of tea. Don’t get me wrong, I do think it’s a fun game to play in the moment especially with my friend, but it’s not something I’ve ever been eager to play. Even though he knows I’ve played it for a good chunk of time and that I’m not all that interested in it, he still insists that I finish the game because he knows there will be a scene in the new movie that features something with the ending of Odyssey. He really wants me to keep playing and brings up on a continuous basis to make sure I don’t forget, but I haven’t had any motivation or interest in doing so and I keep telling him I will before the movie comes out, but I’m really not interested in doing so and I keep putting it off. I don’t want to hurt his feelings with not playing it or end up coming off as a jerk either to him or in this post, but I also don’t want to spend hours of my time willingly doing something that I know doesn’t peak my interest all that much. What should I do?","It is important not to hurt your best friend’s feelings intentionally. It is also important to be understanding and considerate of how they feel. If you think that your friend may be feeling hurt, try to avoid discussing the issue directly. Instead, try to find a way to support them."

In my mind I thought we were still joking but then after that he told his friends and they started to ask me why I would say that while still laughing so I went a long with it and continued to joke about it but two of A’s friends whom I’m also friends with hit me up and started to ask me why I would do that, and that it was messed up. I realized that what I said was wrong and insensitive not knowing what he was going through outside of school.

"267","I need advice. I'm pet sitting for a family and I think I need to cut it short and leave early.","Hey everyone. So I am pet sitting for a family. There is a dog and 5 cats. They are out of the country at the moment and honestly their house is unbearable. For context. I've owned 2 cats in my lifetime (had them their whole lives- 8 weeks to 18 and 21 years respectively) and I've owned 8 dogs (again, their entire lives until natural death). The dog is so horribly trained that he's caused me a couple of bodily injuries such as scratches and a bruise on my ribs from jumping into me. He doesn't know a SINGLE command. I've asked the owners what commands he knows (to see if it's a different language as he isn't listening to english) and nothing they claim works for him. The cats..... they are mean. They swat randomly, grab onto my hair jump onto the kitchen counter while I'm preparing food or eating (which is DISGUSTING- cats step into litter with bodily fluids, then they step onto counters with their nasty feet, gross). They also meow and scratch, and fight with eachother at the bedroom door at ALLLL hours of the night. I haven't slept more than 2-3h every night for 2 weeks. (Yes I got ear plugs, they are so loud I can still hear them)I can easily tell that the dog has not had a SINGLE minute of training, and the cats just do whatever the hell they please, at all hours of day and night. I cant take it anymore. It's been 2 weeks, and I'm miserable. And there is another 10 days, I can't do it anymore. Anyone have any advice? What would you do in this situation?","There's no easy answer when it comes to pet sitting. You may want to discuss your situation with your clients to get their opinion. Some people may feel that you're providing a valuable service by remaining onsite, while others may feel that you should leave as soon as possible in order to avoid any conflict or inconvenience.

"268","Should I tell online friend that sometimes I disappear or stop being active in our community not because I don't care but because I have mental health issues?","Hey,So super short summary. I'm 27M and recently been doing super good. Absolutely killing it at work, getting promotions often. Working on further university education, traveling a bit. But I used to struggle with depression a whole lot. Wouldn't leave my apartment other than to work and I'd sleep most of the time. Then when things got critical I started therapy. It's been a long couple of years but I'm definitely doing much much better but it's still like a shadow looming over me during some days. Occasionally it creeps up on me and I kinda disappear from the world around me again for a bit. Although I'm much better at dealing with this now it still makes stop attending our discord groups events. My good friend runs a community basically. I help out with creating some promotional materials, tech support and organize events too. But when this bad phase comes I kinda stop being active in the community and my projects are on hold because I have no energy to work on them. And I always just tell my friend that I'm busy. But recently I've been thinking it could help to just be honest and let him know what the situation is. So he doesn't think I don't care about the community or the friendship. Do you think this is a good idea?","It is best to honesty with your online friend about your mental health issues and how they may be affecting your online presence. If you feel like you need to take a break from online activity to focus on your mental health, then it is okay to tell your online friend that.

The guy was from Morocco, I have never talked with a  person from that country, so maybe that's normal I don't know, but since I'm not a trusting person I'm not sure if I should report it so no naive girls gives him information or should I just forget about it?

I knew the owners of the place for 8 years before hand and when I started working there it was just as a “cook” to scout for them if I wanted to manage there. The owner who hates me’s sister was in charge while they were looking for a new GM, Tammy. Tammy asked me if I wanted to “Co manage” with her and split the hours. I told her that I wasn’t interested in that. I had my interview with the two owners and they gave me the job solo. Ever sense Tammy found out she refuses to talk to me and still acts like she is in charge and tells employees to do things her way. And when I mean she refuses to talk to me I mean literally, even when I ask her a question she won’t even answer. The only thing she’s ever said to me is “oh I’ve heard bad things about you from my brother” Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? The owners specifically told me that I need to keep her happy. But I don’t know if I can work comfortably and do my job correctly if she’s working and I can’t just quit because my wife and I need this job, specifically because my wife is from another country and we need a stable income for a certain amount of time for immigration purposes.

He loves and helps the poor and homeless when he can and almost allows everyone to walk all over him. I'll give you some examples. He works every day, mostly from 7am-9pm and is exhausted.

He doesn't have a girlfriend. He did once but she was Korean and everyone was telling him that she was using him to stay in the country. To be fair it was very obvious, she would ask those around her for advice to stay in the country longer and stuff like that. She left once my cousins parents didn't him their blessing to marry.He constantly goes to pays for his friends taxi and food but it's gotten worse. When anyone gives him a sob story or if he feels someone is poor he will fake or do something illegal ( where he could lose his licence) to give them medication for cheaper.

I've gone through multiple phases of rebranding and building an online presence in order to find clients organically but nothings worked. The purpose of this was to save as much as I could instead of spending all my capital on paid advertising (TikTok ads, Instagram ads etc.). I've done as much as I feel I can on my website to make it more visually appealing and inviting, along with our social media. I have a hypothesis that I'm not doing enough outreach and/or in the right areas, but I don't know how to reverse engineer the situation to find a solution. Previously, I had a team of me and about five others. We were doing cold calling only, which would get us a couple booked calls each week but very few of them would show. Even if they did, none of them were closed. I eventually had to cut cost and let them all go except for one. Currently, it's me and one other. She does mostly design and social media (posting on our instagram, writing blogs, revisioning the website etc.). I've told her I can hardly afford to pay her, but she's adamant about not leaving so I just kind of let it go. I know this isn't the best practice, but part of me wants to believe that what I'm doing will just take time and I just need to wait it out. Her strategies make sense, for example frequently posting and launching Instagram and Linkedin ads but I just can't afford to keep it going. What do I do?

I’ve been waiting for a girl where things just feel right and I kinda felt that special feeling with her.Anyway a few weeks later class starts and she happened to be in my class.  This time she was wearing a hijab (she’s never worn one before) I didn’t actually know she was Muslim so this was a surprise. I’m non Muslim so I was sort of thrown off by this.

I haven’t tried to talk to her and I’ve taken a hint. (In the past 3 weeks she hasnt worn a hijab)I really like this girl and I just want to get to know her.

I know I sound like a terrible daughter.My mother turns into a very defensive, angry woman whenever she tries to stop smoking - and it really affects our family.On one hand, I don’t want her to smoke. I don’t want her to die of lung cancer. On the other, when she doesn’t smoke she says things she doesn’t mean. She just told me that if my sibling was actually upset over the death of our grandmother, she’d be offering to drive my mother and her to the cemetery or to her old house to sort things out… knowing full well that my sibling and her were crying on each other’s shoulders for days, they go to spiritualists together, my sibling has done a lot more than other people in the family. It’s things like this that make me feel terrible for wanting her to start smoking again. As I said, she’s a very defensive person and she will. not. go to therapy. She always says she’s not a child and she’s not crazy. (This probably stems from her abusive relationship where my father took her to a doctor and tried to convince them that my mother was crazy). She has depression and anxiety… and I really want to help her but my own trauma gets in the way as I despise arguments… but when she doesn’t smoke she turns into a very argumentative woman and NOTHING I say to her gets through to her (I’ve been trying to convince her that some things she says and does is wrong and she has to try and realise that other people have different perspectives of experiences and even though she may feel that she’s done nothing wrong and shouldn’t have to “pussyfoot” around people - others feel that she shouldn’t have said what she did. And she can still think that she’s done nothing wrong from her perspective but still acknowledge that it may have come across differently to others). What can I do? Other alternatives? Nothing seems to calm her down as much as cigarettes. She has meds but refuses to take them. She’ll only take them on days where she gets really anxious. I don’t know what to do, I’m young and it’s a lot for me to deal with when I’m dealing with a shit ton of my own shit.","There is no easy answer to this question. Simply being aware of the health risks of smoking can be a step in helping to stop your mom from smoking.

However just today, 2 weeks from getting my full license (I'm on a CBT), my dad started freaking out about me riding a motorcycle, he was saying things like:- I'm definitely selling my bike now- I don't want you riding a bike anymore- do you want to be a vegetable?- why don't we get on my bike and we can drive 170mph and maybe both not make it home?It was all just very sudden and kind of spooked me, he knows that riding a motorcycle makes me happy and I told him that I am more than aware of the risks involved and mentioned videos of crashes and people going under cars that I have seen and nothing will change my mind about driving a motorcycle.He also doesn't want me upgrading to a larger bike when I get my full license and said there is no more bikes being put in the garage (there is only mine and his when she sells his there would only be mine). I think he is paranoid that I am going to ride like a moron on the road and drive at stupid speed and potentially get myself killed, which I have explained that the only time I would ride fast is on a track.It was all very sudden he said all this and kind of freaked me out, is there anything I can do to put his mind at ease. I think I may ask my mother to talk to him about this or maybe hold a family discussion or something, because some of the stuff he said was simply concerning.","There could be a few explanations for this. One possibility is that your dad is just not comfortable with you riding motorcycles and he wants you to be safe. Another possibility is that your dad is concerned about the potential for accidents. If your dad is worried about your safety, he may want you to stop riding motorcycles."
"278","I’m not thrilled with my partner’s treatment of me, but should I be concerned?","Within the month that we’ve officially been together, I fell for a scam and he told me that if my financial irresponsibility continues, it’s a dealbreaker. He told me that I could potentially be a selfish mom, and my being a picky eater could be a bad example for our future kids. We’ve known each other since we were 9 (I’m 26), and before we got together he always overlooked my flaws, told me he would pick me over any other girl, he saw me as special and I had that special something to him that no other girl has, and even when I would do dumb shit he never judged. He pursued me relentlessly. He said he only started to take my flaws seriously because he needs to consider the repercussions of my actions on our finances and the future kids. I told him it upset me that he found so much fault in me, and he said he just won’t bring it up in the future if he thinks these kinds of things. I’m uncomfortable that he has these thoughts at all, and Even if he doesn’t complain about my flaws I’m concerned about how he’s going to treat me in the future. Because they say that people treat you how they feel about you. Am I overreacting? Should I be worried about how he’s going to treat me?","If your partner is regularly verbally or emotionally abusive, you may have cause for concern. Abuse can create serious psychological and physical effects, which can negatively impact your relationship. If you are in a relationship with someone who is mistreating you, it is important to reach out for help. There are many resources available to assist you in dealing with domestic abuse."
"279","My gf called 50 men attractive in our school, and I dont know what to do.","Me(14), gf(14). Me and my gf have been dating for almost 10 months by now. I have had my own troubles in out relationship from insecurities and the way she acts and talks to others boys are the same as how she talks to Mr. BTW its really important to state that we are trying to keep this relationship a secret. Anyways, yesterday she asked me who I found  really attractive in our school. I didn't have any attraction to any girl I could think of, so I told my friends to name a random girl and I told her rhat. She was ""ok, lol that wierd. Tbh there's 50 attractive guys in 2nd place besides you"" at that moment I felt pain in the middle of my chest which I have also had a lot in the past from stupid memories of her doing stuff. But this time I didn't know what to do. I tried preparing myself for the worst, but I always would have to restart because she would do a simple call or gesture, and I would immediately fall in love instantly. This girl has a best friend a year younger than her, and another about the same age. She said she doesn't like all her other friends because they are ""pick-me, or annoying."" And I have ujusted and settled with her talking to her 1 year younger best friend, but the other guy I would sit at my couch and be crushed inside some days not knowing wtf I need to do. She also barely tries to effort on me sometimes, and only made me a vorthday goofy because I gave her 4 before, she didn't give a single one prior to my birthday. I don't know wtf I am saying. I just wanted to spill everything out, oh ya and I thought of breaking up but I just couldn't, I am still obsessed and in love with her and even if I do break up, she is connected to everyone in my friend group except for like 3 people. I feel frustrated, and i can see that our relationship might be strating to crumble. This is also my first relationship that i have ever been in, and i dont want this to end unless it has to. Can someone please give me some advice on what move I should do or what I should understand in a relationship before doing something stupid or feeling like shit?","There's not really anything that you can do at this point. Just listen to her and accept that she's attracted to 50 different guys at her school."
"280","Turning down friend of a friend as roommate","So a little backstory--Last year I was in a bind and badly needed a roommate. A good friend ""Gina"" said she knew someone else who also was and I met her. I'll call her ""Meg"". Meg seemed nice, but she said some things that I saw as red flags. She wanted to pay an unrealistically low rent, and had previously just been living in her sister's living room. She also asked if I would be cool with us renting a one bedroom and her living in the living room like that--I said no. Things just didn't seem financially viable so I said I'd have to find someone else.I ended up finding a roommate situation with two other women I found on FB that worked out really well for me. Lease is almost up and one of them is moving out so we need another roommate. Gina heard I was looking for another roommate and suggested Meg. I was shocked that she still didn't have a place to live but she's apparently been crashing on Gina's couch for the majority of the past year. I was hesitant but allowed her to view the apartment and said I'd let her know--because I thought I already had someone lined up. Then I thought that maybe even though she had been a bit weird at first but she was willing to pay the reasonable rent and I figured it's better to pick someone I know rather than dont. For safety reasons I ran a background check on Meg and found out she has field for bankruptcy in the past 5 years. This has made me and my other current roommate just NOT want her to move in with us. However, I'm concerned this would mess up my friendship with Gina. Should I just tell Meg that the landlords did the background check and they won't do it because of the bankruptcy? Not sure what to do.","It's not polite to decline a friend's offer to be their roommate, especially if they're a close friend. If you don't feel comfortable living with them, tell them and offer to find them a new roommate."
"281","Should I still drink my medicine after a bug has been in it?","This sounds funny I'm aware. But here's the background.My mom has been on Chinese medicine for 2 years already. I (f16) get irregularly long periods varying from 14 days to even more. So I visited the same doctor as my mom and I am currently on Chinese medicine. It takes hours to brew in a ceramic pot and my mom cooks the medicine for the both of us everyday.So after dinner my medicine was chilling on the counter and I saw a bug drowned in it. I obviously was disgusted and offered to pour it away. And I joked about being glad because I don't like the taste of it. My mom immediately scooped it out said it was still fine, and it cost a lot like 20 USD.Still, that did not convince me and I went back in my room. And my mom started saying in an annoyed tone that it's a hassle brewing medicine for me and she will stop it and let me ""destroy myself"".In hindsight I think after boiling it again it will be fine? But then I really don't want to drink a bug's bathwater. My dad is on my mom's side so idk. Should I drink it? It's in the fridge right now I feel like my parents won't let this matter drop until I drink it.","Some people choose to drink their medicine even after they know they have bugs in it. Others choose to wait until they have the opportunity to properly clean the medicine."
"282","Moving out + Chaotic Parents","Hey guys! Me (f22) and my boyfriend (m23) are planning on moving in with each other within the next year as I finish up classes. As we plan, there is a huge road block. My parents are the typical strict religious parents that are against all the typical “before marriage” things so for me even to seriously bring up moving in with my parents is going to be completely chaotic. For context, a few years back I got caught spending the night at my ex’s house. They swarmed my ex and his family with death threats, tried forcing me on birth control (I’m ace lol), Life360 was always monitored, and I could not go out with friends for an entire year. I lost everything, my hobbies, all forms of “electronics”, friends, etc. Even worse, my father is a high ranking police officer. He used his work resources to run back ground checks on everyone I was involved with. He looked up every bit of private information he could get into and tried using it against them. He even ran things through my phone and laptop to see everything that I’ve searched, communicated through, where I’ve been, everything he could. Personally that sounds like he was abusing his power but that’s a whole other story. This all happened when I was 19/20. I can’t even start to think about what they would try to do if I move out. The few times I’ve hinted moving out to my parents I’ve been hit with “the entire family will disown you”, “you will lose everything (all personal items, phone, car, etc)”, and since my bank account is under theirs, they threaten to take my money as well. As you can see, my family just isn’t that great. Me and my boyfriend have agreed to move in with each other before we get married since I am of the believe that you do not truly know each other until you get married. Even though my boyfriend is the sweetest man I have ever met, I’m terrified I will end up in a situation similar to my parents (typical abusive parenting situation). I really do believe moving in with my boyfriend is what I want to do but I just don’t know how I should manage it with my parents.","If your parents are very chaotic, it can be difficult to live a normal life. You may feel like you have to always be on your toes, and you may find it difficult to stick to any regular schedule. You may also find it hard to make friends because you're constantly worrying about what your parents will do next.If you're unhappy living under chaotic conditions, it might be best to consider moving away from your parents. This may not be an easy decision, but it may be the best way to find peace and stability in your life."
"283","Super asocial now that toxic best friend moved away?","I (16F) always make friends with the same types of people unintentionally.* Mentally ill; moderate severe depression and anxiety + some type of disorder, and also usually has a bunch of trauma and issues* parents are assholes* hyperfixates* EVERY year, these types of friends get addicted to some rhythm game (often a rhythm gacha game) and won’t stop playing them during lunch. I feel like it really limits our interaction since I only see my friends at school because of my parents. But I don’t just tell them to stop because I personally don’t like it, btw. Random but it’s literally happened every time It’s gotten to the point where i’d just rather not have friends at all than keep making unhealthy friends. I have one friend because of this, who still checks off some of these but is an otherwise healthier person to be around. I just feel likeI have nothing to talk about with other types of people. Since my best friend of 3 years moved away this september, I was a little upset at first but relieved because I considered having some space between us before. They had schizophrenia and bipolar II, along with a bunch of other issues. completely unmedicated and untreated, but diagnosed. For some reason I’ve just felt super unsocial since. You know when you just don’t feel like talking to anyone, and kinda wanna just keep to yourself? I ALWAYS feel like that now anytime someone besides with my new best friend, who I’ve known for a couple years. They just weren’t my best friend before this year.It feels very uncomfortable to try and force myself to be social. I try to, but I still just feel very closed off, and nowadays pair/group work really stresses me out. I have absolutely no clue why I started to feel like this. My whole life it’s been pretty easy to talk to others until now.","There may be a period of adjustment where you feel asocial as your best friend moves away, but eventually you will feel more connected and satisfied without them."
"284","I call out way to much","I work in healthcare and since the beginning I have never been the type of employee who doesn’t call out. I used to be way worse calling out maybe every other week. But I started getting on it a year or two ago and started staying at jobs longer than 6 months. Now it’s like I’ve reverted I’m just so unmotivated to show up even if we’re understaffed at work. Im in school part time and work part time but I always pick up so I make full time hours so I can afford to keep my apartment and comfort of living. I’m just so drained even when I’m abled body I just don’t want to. Lately I’ll leave work a couple hours early. I’m very frustrated with my job, but I don’t know what to do because every place I tried is the same but different if that makes sense. I need advice I’m tired of healthcare I want something different but no one will hire me outside of healthcare I feel like I sighed myself a hole. Don’t get me wrong I love where I work but it’s mental health and I think they drained me faster than any other job I worked. I get assaulted, verbally abused by the patients and it’s just part of the job. I struggle because it’s very rewarding when they do get better but when they aren’t it’s exhausting and management isn’t any better."," and don't listen to what people are sayingI am not a good listener. I often call out or talk too much, which interrupts others and makes it difficult for them to communicate."
"285","I feel bad for being annoyed with my friend who insists on drinking so much all the time","Ireally hope I don’t sound like a bitch I’m just kinda scared to bring this up w her because her other friend called her an alcoholic at some point so it’s a sore spot for her. Basically my friend and I like to go out and when we do we tend to drink. Sometimes we’ll get wine at a restaurant or drink/pregame before a party or house show. I enjoy drinking as well but not as much as she does (she likes to get pissed drunk) and sometimes when I say I won’t be drinking tonight she’ll joke about me being a pussy or something. That doesn’t bother me lol idc but it’s just odd to me. We went to a show recently and she bought those liquor shot bottles, drank two before we went and drank one there. When we got there, she barely watched the band. The first thing she did was drink that and when we went to watch them play, she kept going to sit on the couch (it was a house show) saying she’s really tired and has to pee, so I had to keep walking her to the bathroom. We didn’t even see the music for more than 10-20 minutes. I’ve notice she does this a lot where she will agree to go somewhere to drink and doesn’t even do the activity we planned. Like why did we pay for this show if you’re gonna get pissed drunk and not even listen to the music, which is what we’re there for. When we did end up listening to the music for a bit, she didn’t even watch she was just on her phone and kept asking me to take selfies but I was trying to vibe to the music. She kept bringing up how we can leave whenever I want, but the way she said it is like insisting we leave soon. Idk if that makes sense. But it’s like, she just goes to these events, drinks a bunch, and wants to leave right after. I feel like she uses these events as an excuse to drink and I’m kinda worried. I wanna bring it up but I don’t want her to think I’m like accusing her of abusing it. Idk, am I being weird about this? Should I just stop going places with her?","It's not your fault that your friend enjoys drinking; it's their own. It's also not your fault if they're not making good decisions when it comes to drinking; that's something that they need to work on. It's also not your fault if they're becoming sick or injured as a result of their drinking. Ultimately, it's up to your friend to decide how much they drink and how they should be responsible for their own health."
"286","I’m 15 I need life advice","I’m sure this gets asked a lot so sorry about that. My dad died when I was 13 but even when he was alive he was always working so I think I missed out on him a lot, and didn’t really have anyone to teach me how to be a man, or even a person. I don’t think either of my parents knew how to be a person and they kinda just let me do whatever, no expectations or rules or anything. I haven’t lived with my mom since it happened and when I visited her recently she hardly seemed happy to see me. And stuff like that happens often. I moved away from my best friend and we used to call to catch up but now whenever I try he says later and then never does. I feel like an outsider everywhere so it really sucked when the two people who accepted me kinda just forgot about me. I have been to therapy but it was just a lady being encouraging, which I guess was nice but I didn’t change. There’s not really anything I’m passionate about, no artistic gift or wild aspiration or challenge to overcome. If god is real it really seems like he just forgot about me too. I used to try and get girls but now I just don’t care that much anymore. I don’t care about much of anything. I try to get my life figured out like every month but nothing ever changes. In summary I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and I don’t know what to do. Sorry if this sounds dramatic.","There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the advice that's appropriate for someone of 15-years-old may be different than the advice that's appropriate for someone of 30-years-old. However, some general life advice that may be applicable to both age groups includes:Be thoughtful and respectful of others.Be optimistic and stay Positive.Be proactive and take initiative.Be honest and trust your intuition.Be persistent in pursuit of your goals.Give back to the community.Enjoy life while you can."
"287","I hate the feelings love and jealousy but never sadness","I have this person I like dearly, I do not love them, as sometimes I find them hard to talk to and we have absolutely nothing in common. I have a obsession with them, by themselves sometime I find them kinda gross but with others I get jealous. And before you say anything, I know it’s absolutely terrible that I’m saying these things about them that’s why I have to change. I can’t talk about this to anyone as I know that they are going to discriminate me. I probably deserve to be discriminated anyways but that’s why I want to change and stop being so jealous that they are with other people. Any advice? Btw if anyone says to avoid them it will be hard to as they are still my friend (genuinely enjoy their company) and most of my friends are friends with him. One thing I also want to include is that somebody else I know who I use to be friends with (we did not unfriendly each other because of that person it was something else) also has a massive (even bigger than mine) obsession with them which adds fuel to my jealousy. How do I let go?","I feel love, happiness, excitement, contentment, and passion, but never sadness."
"288","I’m (22F) moving to a new city in a few months and don’t know if I should look for a roommate or not","I’m in my last semester of college right now and have to move to a new city for my full time job. I was really adamant about living alone at first because I currently have 3 roommates and have issues regarding cleaning. I don’t know if I just have unrealistic cleaning standards or my roommates are careless or, most likely, a combination of both, but my current living situation has heavily negatively impacted my eating habits. This is the main reason I want to live alone. I can keep my space clean to my standards and start to develop better, healthier eating habits. My hesitation is that I’m moving to a city in which I know absolutely nobody and I don’t want to become isolated. I am an introvert and struggle with anxiety, so making friends isn’t my strong suit. I know I’ll really have to push myself to not stay at home or be by myself once I move if I want to make friends and build a life in this new city. Part of me thinks that a roommate could be a great start to this, especially if I’m able to find someone around my age, but I don’t know if it’s worth the potential roommate issues that may occur since they would have to be a stranger. What should I do? Would it be better to have a roommate in a new city for social reasons or should I just live by myself?",".There is no clear answer, since it really depends on your lifestyle and needs. If you're typically a solo person who doesn't mind living alone, then looking for a roommate might not be necessary. On the other hand, if you're looking for a close-knit community and prefer having roommates, then finding one could be a good idea. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if you think it's worth the effort to find a roommate in your new city."
"289","My wedding photographer scammed us","We’ve been married 7 months. I hired a photographer off of wedding websites, she was from our area and has done several weddings. Beautiful work, we had our engagement shoot with her and other than having to ask for our pictures from her I didn’t get the vibe she’d screw us over. My wedding day came and went she did an amazing job! Like so friendly, helped me stay calm, really just kept the vibe going. Months after our wedding we haven’t heard anything from her. I didn’t want to bother her for the pictures because I understand how long it might take. After 5 months I was reached out by another couple who told me their horrible story about how the same photographer is now refusing to give them their product. Just because they kept asking how long it might take. When I finally asked her for our pictures because our contract states 90 days and at least a sneak peak with in a week she told us how sick she is and that’s she’s gotta a lot going on but it’s coming. I believed her, but more time went on and the promises were obviously empty. I was then reached out by another couple who was going through the same thing. Come to find out she’s been going to the jobs and only giving some of the work or none at all. Some couples didn’t see a thing for over a year. She’s been taken to court over this multiple times. When I called her out on it she denied everything and when she asked me who came to me I refused to tell her because she’s known to call cps or jobs and spread lies. I was afraid for myself and others if I gave her that info. So in return she threatened me to not get the rest of my package and take me to court. So we took her to court, and so did 4 other couples. She didn’t show to any of them so we won. She told us she rather pay us back then give us our photos. And it’s been a week and we still haven’t seen a dime. She would owe close to $20k to all couples, I just can’t wrap my head around someone not wanting to give a product they already did a job for. It’s such a waste of time for everyone involved. Not to mention I’m heartbroken over never getting the most precious memories of my wedding day. I don’t know what to do at this point and idk how to cope with this.","!If you have any concerns that your wedding photographer may have cheated you in some way, it is important to reach out to them and discuss the situation.

"290","He really hurt me but I miss him","A few weeks ago, I told my very close friend of 2 years I was done with our friendship, and I wouldn’t be talking to him anymore. Long story short, he treated me horribly. He would manipulate me, gaslight me and constantly put all the blame on me whenever he did something and I called him out on it. He used to be my best friend, and he used to be such a nice person but changed into a completely different person, practically unrecognizable. About a month and a half ago I said the same thing and after two weeks he texted me and said he missed me and he’s had a crush on me and can see himself being with me in the future, and promised not to hurt me or be awful to me anymore. Just a few days later he was back to being horrible to me, and I couldn’t take it anymore and said I’m done. I go back and forth from hating him and never wanting to see/talk to him again, and missing him so much and feeling like I have to text him. I have a habit of falling back into old toxic habits, because it’s almost comforting to me how familiar it is. I’m not sure what to do, because one part of me hates him and the other wants so badly to text him and tell him I’m sorry and I miss him. I know i shouldn’t but I can’t stop thinking about everything. I’ve been skipping school because I’m terrified to see him, and I’m going back soon and have to face him. Also, I know i shouldn’t be letting someone affect me this much, and I wish I could stop. I would really appreciate some advice."," so muchHe really hurt me but I miss him so much"
"291","Creepy incident at a Copenhagen library, need advice."," I (22f) was studying at a public library in Copenhagen today morning, and around 11.45 am, a middle aged man (not a local, probably middle eastern?) came and sat beside me (even though there were several empty spaces), and laid his magazine on the table which kind of was resting on my bag. So I moved my bag away and he smiled at me. I smiled back and asked me if I was 'abc' (my ethnicity)? When I nodded, he said I was beautiful and told me 'abc' women are very beautiful and I just half smiled in return. Then a couple minutes later he asked me if I know of xyz (famous actor in my home country), and I said yes, and he told me he loves xyz and that hes a very good actor. I know it sounds like an innocent enough conversation but there was something very wrong with the way he was looking and smiling at me and my internal alarms were BLARING. Not to mention, he had a friend (same age, same ethnicity), who was standing there right beside us just watching this interaction which also very creepy. I decided I needed to leave, but did not want to risk leaving and having them follow me. So i called my friend and asked her to get over there ASAP (in my mother tongue so they wouldn't know what I am speaking). The second I picked up my phone and got on the call, the man sitting next to me got up and put his magazine back in the shelf. The two of them just stood there whispering something to each other and then I got on another call (this time my boyfriend), and the men finally left. I am not sure what their intentions were, but it definitely was not good. I'd like to know if I could have handled the situation better and if yes how? And do you suggest any other tips I should keep in mind for the future.","There was a creepy incident at a Copenhagen library last week.

"292","My nephew keeps stealing my car","I pretty much disappear from the internet a lot at the moment, so sorry about that for people who actually know me and aren't just scrolling upon this on r/adviceAnywayMe and my husband have been looking after one of his brother's sons lately. Lots of family drama, he refuses to go back and honestly neither of us can blame him. He's 17 and he went out of his way to try and get in touch with my husband, because previously my husband was no contact with our nephew's dad, his brother. He went to a huge length because, in his mind, nowhere else was safe. That kills my soul a little bit to be honest. He's a very sweet kid, and he's vulnerable and probably terrified at the moment. He gets on well with my husband and they've spent so much time together, it's really sweet to watch as somebody who's hoping to someday start a family with this man. There's just one issue and I'm not even sure if I'm bothered by it, it's just throwing me.My nephew [I'm just gonna call him Ben] has been stealing my car at night. I haven't actually caught him, I only know about this because he fills the tank. I'm actually quite grateful, because that's so expensive lately. I figure it's some kind of apology for taking it? He's not trashing it or anything, he's very tidy and he seems to deliberately try to make himself small and out of the way (it worries me actually) He just seems to like going for a drive at night I'm not angry whatsoever, and I spoke to my husband about it because at first I thought it could've been him. That would've been perfectly fine, my husband is on the insurance. He really is just like his uncle though, because that's something I can remember my husband doing when we were young, I just wish he would ask. I'm fine with him taking the car, I can update my insurance if only he asks. He doesn't ask my husband either, but I suspect that he, the insomniac that he is, would just offer to take him out in his own car instead of taking mine. How do I open up this dialogue with my nephew? I know he's terrified of the consequences of being caught because of how my brother in law had been treating him. I don't want to freak him out or make him feel like he's in trouble. I literally couldn't mind less","Your nephew may be exhibiting signs of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and may be taking your car to steal coins or cigarettes to supplement his ADHD medication.

"293","What to do when someone feels alone but also avoids people?","So i am close to this person. Been gone for about a week. I sent texts asking her if she’s okay and try to help her but took awhile for her to reply to it, and just a flat response. Odd because she never been like this but okay, i guess she wanted to be alone. So i try not to bother her.Today though, she told me that she cried a lot this week, she feels alone, nobody cares about her, nobody reaches her out, and she feels like she’s useless. I was shocked and i asked her that i want to go to her place to be there for her but she said no.I am genuinely confused because she doesn’t want to be alone, but also avoids people that actually care for her. Like i said, i tried to give her space thinking that it’s something that she prefers but that’s also apparently not the case. I am still asking if i can meet her; just to be there, she doesn’t have to talk, nothing, because i know that she will get this bad thoughts again when she’s alone. But i don’t know what else.What should i do?","When someone feels alone but also avoids people, it may be helpful to consider ways to reduce the feeling of isolation. Some things that may help include joining a club or group, engaging in activities that you enjoy, or making connections with people outside of your social circle. Additionally, it may be helpful to reach out to a friend or family member for support."

They are have never really been on their own, even if they're a bit older than me. I think its the small LAC bubble. I'm working full time and just feel like I don't fit in with the whole college experience. I have a 4.0, and school is just not challenging me. I miss having no money and just going wherever my feet could take me because at least then I was free to do whatever, not stuck in classes that I put 0 effort in just to do well. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful that I have the opportunity to pursue higher education, and I have an internship and job lined up for the summer, so I'm applying myself. I just do not feel like I'm doing what I could be.Has anyone felt like this? What can I do to feel like I'm actually doing something fulfilling? Am I just being a stupid 20 year old? (the answer is probably)","One way to feel like you're not wasting your life is to make a list of all the things you're proud of. Also, make a list of all the things you want to do before you die. Be realistic about what you can realistically complete, but don't be afraid to dream big. Finally, take some time each day to do something that you love. If you can find ways to enjoy the small things in life, you'll be more inclined to appreciate the big things."
"295","My (18F) friend (18F) of 16 years says we drifted apart, I need advice.","For context, we are both graduating seniors in high school. I’m leaving my country to go to the States for my undergrad while she’s staying back home. For the past couple months, I’ve been occupied with my college applications and she’s been busy preparing for our country’s national entrance exam.Ever since December, I had a feeling that she was avoiding me. Back in April 2022, she tried cutting me out of her life cause I was going to leave anyway and I understood that, but then she realised it was wrong of her to do that and said she wanted to continue being friends. I did not pressure her into anything, it was always her decision. However, when it started again in December, I thought she wanted to cut me off for good this time. I avoided the bringing up the topic because we had our finals approaching and I didn’t want to mess anything up. Her birthday was in January for which I wrote her a letter, made her a gift hamper with cake jars, coffee jars, chocolates, make up products and a wooden box. Mine was in March (two days before our physics exam), and she forgot to even wish me until very late that night.After our exams, on 11th March, I texted her asking if everything was alright. She said there was a change in our dynamic which was taxing for her. She thought we had drifted apart and didn’t know what she wanted and that it was perfectly normal for friends to drift apart. I agree with her on the last part of it being normal for friends to drift apart but not on the fact that we had drifted apart. However, I respected her wishes. If she didn’t want to maintain the proximity our relationship had, and mind you, we were best friends for 16 years with a gap in between when she had walked out once prior, I couldn’t obviously force her. At this point, she hasn’t even said that she’d like to celebrate my 18th birthday or anything. Today, she randomly texts me asking to meet up. All her other friends have exams until the 5th of April. I genuinely don’t know if she only wants to see me because she has no other friends to hang with right now. I feel very confused. Ever since she texted that, I have been miserable and trying to move on and then, she suddenly wants to meet up. What do I do? I really don’t want a flaky person in my life at this point when I am moving countries and entering into a period of ambiguity, but she’s been my friend literally all my life.","I'm sorry to hear that your friend has drifted apart. If your friend hasn't told you directly, it's possible that he or she is unsure how to move forward. It can be tough to let go of a longtime friendship, but it's important to remember that change is always possible. If your friend feels like he or she is ready to end the relationship, it's important to be supportive. You may want to talk about the situation con tactfully with your friend, and offer your support. It can be helpful to talk about your own experiences with closeness and how you've managed to maintain relationships over time. If your friend is open to it, you can also try reaching out to other friends or family members who may have experience in this area. It's important to remember that each situation is unique, so there is no one answer that will work for every situation."
"296","Parents won’t understand my health problems and pushing me to get married","I have been battling with complicated health issues for past 10 years where I am very tired all the time. It’s mostly muscle pain, fatigue, breathing issues at night. Has put me in deep state of constant anxiety.Parents choose not to acknowledge my health issues and labelling me as “lazy” instead. In our culture, it’s normal to live with parents if you’re single. Even though financially I don’t rely on them.I am in my late 20s and for constant 4 years they’ve been nagging at me for not getting married. Watching my every move, how I spend my time at home, telling me to pray. Especially my mother like I am a kid. Never once did they try to understand my health issues. They want me to get married as it will solve my problem and they can look good infront of relatives because apparently me not being married is embarrassing for them infront of relatives.I feel like the love and care I show them, especially my mother, she takes for granted. I do everything for her, like buying groceries, taking her to doctor’s appointments. While she ignores my issues.I have tried explaining them this ans they emotionally blackmail me like, “do whatever you want, you are killing me”. I am so stressed and can’t even form my sentences properly anymore, it was so hard to even type this. I feel like I am going to die early given my health issues and they make it worse by this emotional torture.What should I do?","It's understandable that your parents may not understand your health problems, and may push you to get married. However, it's important to remember that you're the one who knows what's best for you, and you should make the decision you deem is best for you. speaking to a therapist may be a good way to discuss these feelings with your parents, and to get their perspectives on your situation."
"297","40f and 50m dont know what to do anymore need some advice","Me and my boyfriend have been together over 4 years now.. and throughout our relationship I have found out about him messaging other females sexually and what he wants to do to them and how sexy they are ect.. I have told him how it bothers me and he agrees to stop and does for awhile but then after awhile he is back at it again. He says what's the issue it's not like I'm meeting up with these females or ever will.... and  he hasnt but it still really bothers me .. so he agreed to stop and he was done with it all.. thought he was and then boom found a account and saw pics of his private part on there and pics of his body and messages to different females.. so I say something and he tells me that he did it on purpose bcus he knew I would look thru his phone and since I'm always thinking hes cheating that he did it on purpose... then theres him not ever telling me what he spends his money on until after he gets it and doesn't feel that he has to tell me where and who he gets his money from... a mutual friend shared with me he asked her about something he needed and so she messaged me to tell me she had it so I asked him about it and he got mad and said why do I have to tell you what I ask other people about If they can get me something. And then told our friend that he should of told her that what ever he says to her to keep between them only and to not tell me... and of course our friend told me what he said to her... and anytime I bring up stuff to him that hurts my feelings or I catch him doing he somehow turns it all around on me and I'm in the wrong. I love him but this stuff  is driving me crazy and I dont know what to do ...am I asking to much of him to share those things with me? . what should I do ?","You need to find someone that can help you fix your antenna."
"298","Stylists stole my wig!","I got my sister to drop off my wig to this girl who was going to do my hair. The day comes and she texted me at 11 p.m that night that she was stuck in houston(4 hours from where we live) and could i do it then next day.. I let her know i would be working that next day. I also told her my sister would come pick up the wig that next day. She apologized but never texted me back after I told her my sister would pick up the wig. So the day comes and my sister goes to her house to pick it up and its not in the box. She rings the doorbell and no one comes to the door. I call and text her and no answer. Finally she texts me saying why is my sister at her mom door because she texted me and said she would be home later that day. Mind you I never got a text. I told her my sister would be back after work to get it and to put it in the box.. sister goes back after work and no wig.. now yall know I want to go to get my wig with the police after I get off today. My boyfriend said he would buy me another wig and im better than that. Tell her she can keep the wig. My question is should I go get my damn wig or just let it be? I ended up customizing another wig for that day and it was perfect. Im done with these stylist.","If you're experiencing hair loss, it's important to have a backup plan in case your hair stylist steals your wig. If you have a good relationship with your stylist, you may be able to negotiate a trade. If not, you may need to find a new stylist who is more accommodating to your hair loss needs."
"299","How do I apologise to someone I’ve ghosted 5+ times","We’re both 21 if that matters.I know that by the title alone I already sound like a bad person, you’re probably right in some way.Me and this woman have been friends for the past 5 years. We met during a schooltrip in high school, and our friendship blossomed from that. Long story short. I asked her out after a year and she rejected me, we stayed friends afterwards as we enjoyed each others company a lot.After graduating high school is when the problems started in our friendship. After graduating I was hoping that we could hang out as friends, as we were going to college in 2 different cities. We never had the type of friendship where we would hang out outside of school. During the summer break after graduating I asked her that. She said that she isn’t comfortable with that and enjoys our friendship as it is. I consider that the beginning of the end of our friendship.After half a year of just talking online I grew tired. I’ve never been the person to chat too much, I value spending time in person. I decided to slowly fade from her life. Respond less frequent and less enthusiastic until I just stopped responding. We wouldn’t talk than for some months until she would message me again, and we would talk again until the cycle repeats. I’ve done this in total of 5 times in the last 3 years. The last time was 3 weeks ago.I really do love her as a friend and I’ve never had a friend of the opposite gender like her. But I accepted a long time ago that it’s not meant to be. Now my conscience is gnawing at me. I never said this all to her, now I feel like she deserves to know.I’m not trying to reconnect with her, just explain what I wrote here to her as I think she deserves it. Afterwards I hope that we can ‘officially’ end our friendship amicable and go our seperate ways.How does this sound? Should I do this or just leave her be? If so how would I even go about explaining it to her?","?There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to apologise to someone you’ve ghosted may vary depending on the context and relationship between you and the person you’ve ghosted. However, some tips on how to apologise privately to someone you’ve been ghosting may include sending them a heartfelt email or text message, offering to talk on the phone, or scheduling a time to meet in person."
"300","How do I tell my future employers that I need to push the start date?","I signed an offer letter for a therapist position this week but I realize the start date of July is likely too soon. I graduate in may, still need to receive my NCE scores (for temporary licensure) and complete the Licensed Graduate Professional Counselor application and wait for everything to process. I calculated that I might not have the license till august / September. I’m really worried if I communicate this to them they will take away the offer or say they do not want to wait for me. I really want this job to work out so any advice is appreciated. I am scheduled to go to the office in person on Wednesday to check out the space. Someone advised that I simply ask if they have experience with how long the process takes and say I’ll keep them posted. But I am just not sure how the best way to handle this is. I also don’t want them to think I’m irresponsible for not realizing this would be an issue before signing the offer letter. Although the offer letter says “tentative start date July 1st” I really don’t know if they are willing to wait an additional two months. Thanks for any and all advice!","There is no standardized way to communicate this to employers, but some common methods include emailing or messaging your future employer directly, expressing your sincere desire to have the project start as soon as possible, or trying to work out a compromise in order to start sooner."
"301","Is it normal my Gf 16F and i 16 M dont get butterflies with eachother ?","Me and my girlfriend have had our first kiss a few weeks ago none of us felt butterflies even though we kept kissing and repeatedly after that yesterday she came to my house and we kept cuddling hugging and kissing for 2 hours still none of us felt butterflies we were too comfortable with each other when I asked her about that she claims that she feels so comfortable and don't mind me touching her anywhere and that she doesn't even feel so excited and happy when she is around me she just feels so comfortable and normal same goes for me the difference is that whenever I think about her or I think about the moments of us kissing I get butterflies but she doesn't we have been talking for 2 years on and off but the longest times were 5 months and then 5 months break up and then 5 months which is our current situation we keep talking every single day and we call a lot we always sleep on call with each other and we seem to flirt a lot with each other on call this in normal thing or should I worry? She used to feel butterflies when i touched her had eye contact with her or just talked to her but it was a while ago we both love and like eachother a lot we both love eachother so much and we lile eachother tooo so","It's not abnormal if your girlfriend doesn't experience butterflies or other types of intense emotional responses when you touch her. It is possible that she isn't as emotionally attached to you as you are to her, or that you two have different sexual preferences. It may be worth considering whether you two need to reassess your relationship before things get further stagnant."
"302","I received an invitation to Emirates Open Day","Okay hello guys :D As you can see from the title I received an invitation for an Open Day for Emirates (the airline) When I applied for this job it was one evening when I came back from my normal 9-5 job and I was absolutely sick of it, I started scrolling through job offers and I was like fuck it I’ll apply, I didn’t put much effort or thought into it, I even attached a picture with a HORSE because I had nothing better on my phone at the time, and after 5 months I received an email. Now here’s the thing, I’ve got scars from self harm on my left fore arm, and they are VERY visible. I was looking at the cabin crew uniform and I know that they wear short sleeves, I haven’t even seen an option of wearing long sleeves. I’ve kinda accepted that my chances of getting this job drops to -5, but then again miracles do happen, I could get them removed with a laser but I’m sure this process will take a couple of months and I won’t manage to do it before the open day. But should I still go? I could whoo them with my charm but surely this won’t allow me to jump over this obstacle.What do you guys think? I appreciate any replies and have a lovely day 🥰"," from a colleague.I was looking forward to Emirates Open Day!"
"303","I think i was neglected as a child, and I am having difficulty coming to terms with it.","Since I was 3.5 years old, I started staying with my grandmother, and my parents told me that I started staying with her because I used to throw tantrums that I wanted to live with my grandmother (I don't mildly remember anything like that, but I remember crying every time they left after visiting me). Everything was fine except for the fact that I missed my parents. One time, after a year of going to school, I was given some homework where I had to fill in a sheet (name, birthday, address, etc.). I did it, and I put my parents' address in the address section, and my grandmother scolded me severely, and I was not allowed to cry. Things like these were pretty normal growing up with my grandmother. She'd rather I sit and watch TV than run around. She didn't like me going to my friend's house, and she didn't like them coming over either.I finally started staying with my parents when I was 12 years old (they decided I could stay with them because they came to the same town my grandmother was staying in and they wanted my sister to go to school in the same town), but then again, when I was staying with them one time, I learned that they were using my loofah to clean the (insides of) garbage box, and when I asked them about it, they told me that I was making a big deal out of nothing. Even when it came to allowance, I was given a third of what my sister got, and my friends went out pretty often, so I just stopped going out with them, and now I like being all by myself;  and don't like socializing much .  I am 22 now, and I don't think I resent them, but I am deeply hurt by what happened. I had a conversation with my dad a year ago about the issues I was facing, about how I tend to block myself from making new friends or how I have a hard time making decisions, be they small or big, and he looked so hurt and helpless. I think he is the more sensitive and understanding of the two, but I also don't want to label either of them as bad. He asked me if he had lacked on anything on his part, if he had failed to do something for me; and that hurt me even more. I realized that I didn't want to see that look on either of my parents faces. But I do find myself struggling because of a lot of things in the past. I struggle a lot in relationships as well, because I tend to push them away, I've never let anybody beyond the talking phase.I believe my current problems have their roots in the past, but I'm not sure what to do with this realization. Should I try to talk to my parents about it? What should I do?","This might be a sign that you were neglected as a child. If you feel like you were not given the care and attention you needed, it can be hard to process the emotions that come with it. It is important to remember that being neglected as a child does not make you a bad or bad person - it just means that you were not given the same level of support and care that others were. If you are struggling with these feelings, it may be helpful to talk to someone about them. There is no shame in seeking help, and there is plenty of support available."
"304","My best friend and I like the same person","Me and my friend are both 13m, and the we like a 13f that goes to our school.Alright, so we went on a class trip and he ended up telling me that he liked my first “real” crush. For most of the trip, I tried hiding my feelings about it eventually, I decided to tell him that we liked the same girl during the next school break, but he insisted I tell him that night, so I did. We were very chill and great friends about it, but most of all, we didn’t want it to interfere with our friendship.so, let's skip forward a bit. He enjooyed snapping her but got really doubtful because she constantly kept ghosting him and then if I snap her, she would almost instantly repsond, as if she was using him for streaks. nonetheless, a few days ago he confessed to her. she ended up saying she liked someone else at the moment.now, recent few days. He has been really hard on himself and is really trying to get me and her together, thinking that there is no way she doesn’t like me. he just told me that hes doing it because he feels guilty for almost completely preventing me and her from getting together, because he was being a selfish dumbass and not seeing the signs of him being friendzones. (his words not mine). I tried to get him to relax and calm down. It went on like this for a solid few minutes.I dont know what to do. I promised him I would continue to ‘try’ to get with her, so yes, I’m gonna do that, for him. But thats not really what I am having difficulty at. Its supporting him during this massive heartbreak while not having him feel guilty and upset at himself and feeling like a selfish dumbass.","There is no 'one best friend' – everyone has different best friends based on their personality, interests and lifestyle.

"305","Should I quit my job?","So I recently got a second job in my college town. The problem is I'll be graduating in two months and will have no where to stay. I work in a house with a disabled woman, so it's her house. The woman's mother offered to let me stay in the house however there are a few issue with this. 1. I would have nowhere to put all my stuff. 2. My insurance is not accepted upstate for a lot of departments like endocrinologist and ophthalmologist so I'd have to constantly go back home. 3. I'd have to get a second job and my college town is pretty small and there aren't a lot of job offers. 4. I wouldn't even be able to stay there 24/7 because there are other staff doing night shifts. With all this being said I feel like I should just quit. I'm not going to lie I'm going to try and collect at least 3 paychecks first because I am broke. But it also doesn't seem worth it to me. I'm trying to get my own place and move away from my narcissistic mother. I'd rather just get a better paying job in my city and live at home until I can do so.","This is a difficult question to answer.

"306","why am ı embarrassed in emotional scenes?","Hello, I am a person who loves reading books but I didn't read often because I had a social life, I was 15-16 years old at the time and the day corona came, with the school holidays, I locked myself at home for 3 years. Neither social media nor anything else, I had no contact with anyone and I completely immersed myself in books, with the end of the virus, I returned to social life again, it was quite difficult at the beginning, I forgot how to chat and talk to people and I gradually opened up (I still sometimes have a hard time talking). I am now 19 years old and because I read books for a long time during the virus period, my perspective on many things has changed, I started to think more broadly, As for my problem, my opening to life is to start doing things that I used to enjoy:movies, anime, manga, but I can't watch and read them like I used to, I enjoy them a lot, but even though I like the emotional scenes, I feel embarrassed and can't continue (heroic shouts, emotional speeches of the characters, etc.) I didn't have this problem before, in fact, I used to enjoy it (still do) and I couldn't stop smiling, and now, even though I force myself to watch it, I stop it immediately because I feel embarrassed and try to pull myself together, and I have no idea why this is happening, is it my personality normally like this and it showed itself as I grew up, or is there another reason? I don't know what I can do about it I don't understand myself at all :((my English is not good, I used translation help, I apologize if it is not clear)","There is no single answer to this question, since everyone experiences embarrassment in different ways. However, some possible reasons for feeling embarrassed may include feeling like you are being watched or judged, experiencing fear or anxiety, or feeling like you are an outsider in the situation."
"307","Everybody thinks I’m racist and I am being bullied","Im in Highschool right now and I always feel terrible. I don’t know any other words to describe these people other than “woke” I have guitar class and I sit with these group of friends. Im a metalhead and I love metal, and they always make fun of me for it. Anyways, one day one of the girls asked me if I liked jazz. I said “I recognize the talent that goes into it and it’s not really my thing. I don’t listen to it. I don’t like it, but it takes talent for sure.” Then she went on this huge loud rant (that everyone in the class heard) about how “Im racist” for not liking jazz or rap. And how I “hate Black people” Also, she’s white. There’s a black guy that sits with us and he literally doesn’t give a shit.  She always loudly refers to me as “anti black.” And it gets on my nerves. I’ve also been labeled as transphobic for not thinking people can identify as animals. My best friend is literally trans and doesn’t agree with that either. And I’ve been labeled as homophobic because I hate pride parades. I am bisexual, and I have two dads who also hate pride parades because they just want to be normal people. I’ve had people block me, I’ve had people verbally abuse me on social media, all because I don’t completely agree with their narrative. Now I have no friends and  everybody at my school hates me. I’m accepting, but they all hate me because I don’t like their performative activism and buzzwords and shit. I don’t know what to do. Everybody hates me. What do I do? I feel lost.","There is no one thing that everyone thinks, and everyone experiences bullying in different ways. Some people may feel like they are being discriminated against or ridiculed because they are of a certain race or ethnic group. Others may feel like they are being picked on because they are weak or unpopular. Ultimately, the bullying is an experience that is unique to each person. If you are feeling bullied, there are a few things that you can do to deal with the situation:Talk to someone – If you are feeling alone and afraid, talking to someone about the situation may help. Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist can help you to feel more supported and understood.Get professional help – If you are feeling constantly bullied, it may be helpful to seek professional help. A therapist can help you to better understand the bullying and provide support to help you manage the situation."
"308","I think I’m losing the only real connection I’ve had with another human being in the last 10 years, what should I do?","I have had a tough time making friends and whenever I think I’ve finally made an actual friend, they just stop reciprocating and become cold and distant. A few months ago I met someone who I was able to connect with on a deeper level than most people I’ve ever interacted with and this person is special to me, but lately their responses are often 4-5 days after I ask them anything, they don’t even read or hear what I have to say most of the time and just try to actively end conversations with very weirdly phrased one liners clearly signalling that that’s supposed to be the end of the conversation. I’ve tried to get an answer out of them about what’s going on but it really hasn’t worked and they’ve stopped opening up to me. Any logical person would tell me that it’s time to move on but I don’t know how many more times I have it in me to start from 0 again and fail at making an actual friend (as I do every single time), and this person means a lot to me, so a selfish part of me just doesn’t want to let go of this friendship. What should I do?","It might be tough to come to terms with, but it's possible that you're losing the connection because the other person is no longer interested in you. If this is the case, it's important to remember that you're not alone and that there are plenty of other people out there who want to connect with you. You can either keep hoping that the other person will change their mind or you can move on and find someone else who shares your interests."
"309","Is it okay for me (f18) to have my first kiss with someone else if we aren’t in a talking stage?","Hey I know this sounds a bit silly but once I explain it might make more sense. I have just turned 18 and I’ve never had a boyfriend, never kissed anyone or anything past that. I stg my rice purity score is like 94 lol. Most I’ve ever done is literally hold hands with a boy in my year in a talking stage when I was a younger teenager. And to be honest I’m a very nervous person although I come across as confident, and I’m going out for the first time to some clubs in a month ish. And to be honest I just want my first kiss out of the way whilst I’m tipsy just to take the edge off. I think having my first kiss with someone I feel an emotional connection to would be too stressful for me, what if I was really bad and they wouldn’t be interested anymore? Then if they still liked me would they tell me I was a shit kisser? Thoughts like that. My logic is if I’m slightly tipsy, I probably won’t be so stressed about that, and I can actually kind of learn what I’m supposed to do without the pressure? Then it just doesn’t have to be such a stress when it comes to someone I actually care about. Thing is though, there’s a boy I’m chatting to. And it’s not like we’ve agreed to start a talking stage, or dating or anything. We only really message each other, we don’t talk much in school. He told me last year he liked me but I knew I wasn’t emotionally ready and I didn’t have the time to do a relationship the commitment it needs. Plus I have a fear of commitment from being surrounded by some unhealthy relationships throughout my life. So I just told him that in a surface level kinda way and left it at that. But getting near to a year later he replied to a story I put on and I responded and we started chatting. I know he still likes me but we have a mutual friend who made it clear I’m not ready rn and I just want to get to know each other as friends first. But I’m open to the idea in the future once our lives are less busy w school etc maybe.However, would this mean that when I go out, would I be a shitty person if I kissed someone else? Knowing he likes me? I’m really not sure, my sister thinks it’s absolutely fine but I almost feel guilty even though I haven’t done anything. Thank you in advance.","Yes, it is okay for you to have your first kiss with someone else if you are not in a talking stage."
"310","I need help.","I guess it didn't help that I went down a Google rabbithole. I have a 13 going on 14 year old toy poodle. She's been my best friend, my rock. We shared so much in common, health and behavior-wise. She is blind, had cataracts since she was 7/8 or so. Now her hearing is starting to go, and she is starting, or has been since the beginning of February, using the bathroom on the floor, carpet, beds, blankets, everything.I fight with myself to figure out what to do. She walks slow,takes a while to walk out the door to go outside, but she barks and sneezes, does what she always does when she doesn't want other dogs around her. I feel as if she has that energy then she's still okay? She's still healthy? I hate seeing her in pain, and I have no idea if she is hurting while walking. I want to give her medicine to stop pain if need be, heart medication if she gets worse, anything. Anything to keep her longer. I have another dog and I love herjust as much, but my bond with my first pup is so special.I have really bad anxiety and abandonment problems, and I feel my heart squeeze and hurt, but also annoyed that she no longer stays with me. She won't even stay in my room if I pick her up and lay her down in my bed. She will stare at the door and whine until I tell my mom to come and get her. It's painful that I can't even spend time with her when I know it's going to happen soon.Basically what I am asking is, when shouldyou decide to put your animal to sleep? I can't type that without crying pathetically but everything I read is clearly making it worse. It's intense, I can't even sleep.

We only get to spend a few days out of the week together even then it’s late at night, like it’ll be 4 am for me and it’s only 1 am for them so I’m completely exhausted the next day. It’s only been three months but my body can’t physically keep up with it anymore.And I feel bad for wanting to not spend time with them but I hardly get any time for myself, im either working, at school/ after school activities, or attending to them and/or my own friends. It’s been too much to juggle socially so I end up shutting down. And that’s on top of the dreaded feeling of loneliness i get when I see my friends spending time with their partners, or when I get hit on at work, or just when im alone in my room and just want to be held, comforted, something of the like.  And im thinking I should call quits on this and look for someone local. I really don’t want to break their heart but it’s just weighing a toll on me. Select friends I’ve asked haven’t been of help, telling me “just do what feels right bro” but I really can’t when my minds been in such turmoil that I can’t tell my left from my right Any advice will help thanks :)","Feeling lonely is a very common symptom of depression. It can make it hard to enjoy activities you used to enjoy, and it can make you feel like you're the only person who feels this way. Loneliness can also make you feel like you don't have anyone to talk to, and can make it hard to get out and meet new people. If you're feeling lonely, it might help to talk to your doctor or mental health therapist about how you're feeling. They can help you find ways to cope with loneliness and make it more enjoyable."
"312","I am currently confused with my feelings","So, I liked this guy for 5 months. On the 3rd month I confessed, got rejected nicely. Was overthinking for some time because I thought I ruined a great friendship. We were good friends, great even, I just wasn't confident on how well I know them and how I think they'll react. Was thinking so much about it the whole time after I confessed. The month after we met again (i confessed before a long vacation) I didn't talk to them. From hanging out every break time to barely even exchanging words. That lasted a month, there was a bit of progress but I knew that it wouldn't ever be like then. The thing that I was scared about happened, and it's all because of me.On the 5th month, I met someone that made me realize what my type really is. Not going to be considering the second person as a 'crush' but more like an eye candy. It really made my day to see them. Now they're leaving, after a month.My problem is, I feel like the happiness that i felt back then in those 5 months are coming back. The delight I feel when I see their smile. The happiness when there's interactions between us, and others. I just really don't know if this is sincere or is it just because I don't want to go back to having no person to be attracted to. I got a taste of what liking someone feels like and now I don't want to go back. tldr: liked someone for 5 months, ""moved on"", found an eye candy, now I feel like my feelings are back for the first person","I am currently feeling confused."

So i can be a bit of a flirt and I was flirting with some people in chat and yk hugging and kissing and I was also talking to this guy but it was never going past talking and kissing and the guy I like wants me to tell him wen I’m talking to someone and I didn’t tell him the first time and now he’s thinking that I’m lying to him and I’m out here just fucking people behind his back wen it was only flirting, kissing, and heavy petting it never got passed any of that and now I think he hates me. So what do I do to fix it with him I wanna do better by cus I like this guy so much like like yk the like before it turns into love, it’s just that much.","What can I do to help improve my quality of life?You might want to consider speaking with a therapist, discussing your concerns and attending self-help groups or counseling.

"314","Brother reads book that could trigger him","I think most teens know the „girl in pieces book“ and if not let me explain it by what i‘ve noticed about this book. Its about a 17 year old girl who struggles throughout her life. The book starts when she receives help for her mental illnessI heard it has some very disturbing or graphic ways of telling about self harm. Its a depressing book in my opinion, good written but could be very triggering for people who are undiagnosed and feel the same way. The thoughts the character has are very insulting.In this case I think my brother feels the same. I‘m glad he reads books but at the same time i‘m scared he might harm himself or his mental health will go south. When I was his age I used to read depressing wattpad fanfiction and once I didnt read for a while, my state got better. I‘m scared my brother wont. He doesnt talk much about his problems and only through jokes or on social media on a venting account. I found it because it was recommended to me. Idk what to do. I dont want to take this book away from him or hide it but as someone who struggles with mental health i dont want him to go through the same. He is a person who is easily affected by the problems of others. He is the therapist friend but struggles himself. I‘ve told him multiple times to take care of himself too but it doesn’t seem like he does. Fact is.. i dont want him to read it. It will definitely affect him and i need some advice on how to handle this","There is no definitive answer, as different children will react differently to different books. However, if your brother is particularly sensitive to certain themes or topics, he may be more likely to become upset or anxious if he reads a particular book. If this is the case, you may want to talk to your brother about the book and see if he is willing to take a look before it is actually read."
"315","Dealing with threats after a breakup","This was actually quite a while ago, but I’m still thinking about it. I like to have a laugh about it sometimes but genuinely I don’t know how to think of it? I dated this gal for maybe less than 2 months, and we had broken up on good terms due to personal reasons. I thought it would be fine obviously, we hadn’t been together long enough even to fight nor to get into any rough patches. But a while after, I had found out they had been talking to a “friend” (very complicated) about me, talking about how they wanted to push me down stairs etc and talking about things that never happened. See, this wouldn’t be a problem but the thing is, we go to the same school. I just saw them recently too and it made me so nervous, but thankfully i didn’t get seen. A year before, we had the same class together and it was complicated but, I’m on special school so I only was in that class like twice. So… I’d like advice on how to deal with going to a school with someone who wants to push you down stairs? That’d be nice.","Breaking up can be a difficult experience, but it is also a time when you can start to heal. If you are experiencing threats after your breakup, it is important to remember that it is not your fault. It is possible that your ex is feeling overwhelmed and out of options after the breakup.If you are feeling threatened, it is important to remember that you can always reach out for help. There are many resources available, including your local domestic violence hotline or a support group for people who have broken up. You can also talk to a therapist about your experiences."
"316","I barely see my fiance anymore because of his job. Where do I start to fix this?","My fiancé works as a direct support profressional for one of the major healthcare companies in our region. It's a 24/7 care job where he goes to a dedicated house and takes care of the people who live at that house. There's no way to change his schedule, unless they hire someone extra, which is a struggle. Even then, it would give him one day off, which will help but the other weekdays are still going to be terrible. He can't move his hours because nobody else wants to move theirs, or can move their hours. The only other person who works with him that gives a fuck wants his hours, but they can't switch since she's the house lead and needs to work normal 9-5 hours. He technically could be lead but you cant have two leads at the same house. He can't really move locations because all the other houses he can work at have worse people than what he currently deals with.I hate how my fiance is always the one to cover someone else's ass at work. Someone has to legally be at the house at all times so it's not like he can tell his boss ""no"" when everyone else has already said no. I hate how he works 2-10 on weekdays while I work 8-4 on weekdays. I'm always asleep by the time he gets up and he's always asleep by the time I get up and go to work. We get the weekends together, but chores and him having to cover people always take away time we have with each other. I cant move my hours around because I work in an office setting. I'm fucking sick and tired of not seeing the love of my life because of his job. He's burnt out because he never gets to see me 5 days out of the week, sometimes 6 like this week.I'm just at my wit's end here. He has no idea what he would want to do besides being a DSP. No other jobs interest him and he's afraid of switching jobs and becoming even more stressed. It's so much to take on. I have no idea how to even discuss job potentials with him, or where I would start to look. He has his high school degree and years worth of customer service/DSP experience and that's it. Maybe if we can find something he's interested in, we can get him education, but even getting to that point seems impossible. I have no idea how to help him and it's making me feel like I'm defenseless and a failure. We both feel trapped and I'm not sure how we can free us.","First, try to find out what is going on that is causing him to be absent from your life so much. Is he working long hours, is he feeling overwhelmed with his work, or is there something specific that is bothering him at work? If you can't determine the source of the problem, you may need to consider talking to him about his feelings. He may be reluctant to discuss his issues, but you could try to get him to open up by asking him what is going on and why he is feeling so stressed. If he doesn't want to talk about it, then you may need to consider taking a step back and adjusting your relationship until he is ready to talk about what is worrying him."
"317","Mods from depression post retaliating?","I made a post on the r/ depression a while ago and looked through the rules 3 times before finalizing my post to make sure it met the mod’s standards. Soon it got to 16 comments and almost 100 likes and I was able to gain a lot of insight from so many amazing people. However, there were 3 comments that I got email notifications on but they were deleted off of my post so I could unfortunately only read through the first half of them. I sent a message to the moderators to find out why they had been deleted, and shortly after I found that I can no longer access ANY of the comments on from the original post, and the post itself has been disabled/deleted. Why would they do this to someone struggling? I gained so much reassurance from the comments that I was able to read in time and was just starting to feel alright again. Now the mods have completely taken it away. I’ve messaged them again about this, and still complete silence on their end. Can anyone else access those comments from your end from my profile? Please help me learn what went wrong if you can…","I would recommend not retaliating with depression because it will only make the situation worse.

"318","Nobody likes me","I don't understand. I'm sociable. I'm attractive. I'm empathetic. I'm well-mannered. I'm charming. I'm wise. I give good advice. These are some qualities other people have ascribed to me.I've had friends before when I was in my early 20s, but I had a falling out with many of them, and the overall number of friends I had were minimal at best. I'm now in my late 20s and left with but a single friend with no idea how to find more. I'm not invited to parties anymore as I was in my teens/early 20s since my peers now have families and careers. Also, I'd feel awkward going to a party thrown by early 20s. I feel that it might be my attitude that is off-putting to people. I don't know why, I always try to uplift everyone around me, and im kind and respectful. Though it's true that I can often be rather sassy. I suppose the main inhibitor of my attitude is my persistent depression, which dampens my mood and, therefore, my attitude considerably. My life sucks. That's just how I feel. I don't really go out there displaying this attitude to everyone, though,  but I guess maybe people feel the energy when they're around me?","There are no specific reasons why someone might not like you.

"319","How to get my boyfriend to go against his parents?","   I have been dating my boyfriend (M18 and F18) for a couple months now and we are both still in high school and living with our parents. I have noticed that he avoids confrontation with his parents but it has gotten to the point where I feel hurt by it. We make plans to do things together and while he seems really excited in the moment he doesn’t ever bring it up to his parents until the last minute or unless I pressure him to do it. This normally means that he can’t go or there is some sort of scheduling conflict with his family that we didn’t know about before. I try not to get annoyed by this but it is inconsiderate. When I have talked to him about this in the past he seems genuinely remorseful and says he will be better. Most recently, I wanted him to sleepover at my house while my parents were away. He said he would love to but that his parents would say no. But he also refused to even ask them. From what he has told me it doesn’t seem like their family fights ever. However, I am starting to believe that that is because he chooses to just never go against his parents. I am fine with his parents boundaries but I am hurt by his lack of communication and that it feels like he doesn’t care about me enough to fight with his parents or even risk a disagreement. What do I do? Note: I really dont think he is in an abusive situation so for the sake of this conversation lets say that there is no risk involved. Also, this mainly applies to big events and trips. Aside form these bigger plans we spend all hour so the day together and have a very happy relationship.","There is no one definitive answer to this question. Some potential strategies include:-argumenting and reasoning with your boyfriend until he feels sufficiently motivated to go against his parents;-arguing that your relationship is more important to him than his parents' wishes;-encouraging him to talk to his parents about the situation and see if there is a compromise possible;-insisting that he breaks up with you if he decides to go against them; and-engaging in covert behavior (for example, sneaking around or communicating through third parties) to underminethe relationship between your boyfriend and his parents."
"320","Speaking your native language when a non-speaker is present","I am currently working in a small lab and for the past 6 months, I have been working with Vietnamese colleagues who have lived in the UK for 4+ years. It always used to nag me how they would switch up what language they were speaking when they were talking to me, but I just put that to they didn't know the translation, so were talking to each other on how the translate. However, at the moment, I would say my day consists of me understanding 10% of the conversations with my colleagues and 90% of them switching up languages and joking and laughing in-between. For the past few months, when we go for lunch, they start a conversation in English  and then suddenly they change to Vietnamese. I have asked them multiple times if they would include me as I was in the conversation too, but they tend just to switch to English for like a sentence then straight back to Vietnamese. It got even worse when we went out as a company as they completely isolated me. I got so frustrated so I started walking ahead as I wanted to day over and done with. They asked why I didn't want to walk with them and I told them I was feeling quite isolated and one of my colleagues snapped back and basically said how it is her native language so she can do what she likes. I completely understand that, but to me I find it really rude if people speak a different language when a non speaker is involved. Also, to laugh and joke about the non speaker in a different language. I am honestly finding it so draining and I have completely lost my passion for my job. Am I overreacting to this? Also how do I deal with they situation without causing a huge fuss? My boss knows about it but they are not in the lab most of the time so its just me and my colleagues.","Pleased to meet you.

I expressed to him that I don’t want to do this anymore if he can’t stop cheating in the past.  Regardless of it being emotional or physical.  He has gone out to many bars without me and sometimes doesn’t even let me know. I live at home with my parents and he lives at home with his. I got a dui and I am dealing with the re procutions of it and he’s not. I tell him count your blessings cause you are a cdl driver and it could have been worse for you. We were together when it happened.

My brother dropped him off and I went with my brother and he had his friend pick him up. Should I brake up with him or try to work things out. I have been with him for a long time but I feel ever since I’ve known him I take him back and I’m over this.  I don’t need him going out with his friends drinking and possibly cheating. He always comes back home at 3-5 am.  And I can’t trust him. Am I being insecure or am I being rational and should I end this.","That's a difficult question to answer.

"322","Should I take this promotion??","Currently I am working at a call center and I’ve been encouraged by most of the management to apply for the position of a Team Lead. I applied for this position a few months prior but wasn’t eligible because i wasn’t at the company long enough. Management seems to have a strong belief in me that I can  be a good fit for the position. So what’s the issue you might ask? Here are the  pros and cons of taking the position :Pros: • My very first (possible) leadership role • Take less calls • Can add to my resume for future opportunities. • Higher pay ( like a $1-2 raise) Cons: • I will forfeit my Work from Home privilege• I don’t drive so I would spend a lot of money on Uber (no busses directly go from my house to the office • Higher workload• 100% guarantee my calls will be all escalated angry customers .• Fear that i won’t be taken seriously by my peers due to my age/ experience. As you can see , I don’t really like working at a call center job (makes ends meet) and being on the phone so that’s a big reason as to why I’m even considering taking the position. What should I do?","There is no definite answer, as promotions can be a great way to increase your income, but they also come with risks.

"323","My mum has screenshots of me and my boyfriends sexual messages and is sending them to people.","My (18f) mum has screenshots of my sexual messages with my bf (18m). For context, around two weeks ago I was at work and received a number of abusive messages from my mum talking about the things I’ve sent in the messages. She found this out because my younger sister went onto my laptop and looked through my messages and took more than 20+ pictures of my messages. This situation has been eating at me for the past two weeks and even caused me to leave the house for one night. The messages were very personal and extremely detailed about sexual stuff and what turned us on, JUST VERY DIRTY TALK lol. What caused me to make this post is that last night my mum was on the phone talking shit about me and my brother was defending me, next thing he gets 20+ attachments of screenshots. And while she sent those she was laughing and making jokes about the messages. So pretty much she will just sent my messages to anyone who asks.This situation is seriously having a toll on my mental health and I’m just not sure what to do about this.

"324","I confessed to someone but now I'm only more confused","So there is this guy I really like, we met through mutual friends. With some help from another friend I found courage to ask him out (first time I've ever done that) At first his reaction was surprised but he seemed eager. I asked him to let me know when he wants to hang out but he kinda never did and after some time I used the good weather as an excuse to which he agreed. We spent like 4 hours just walking and talking and I think it went well (we don't know each other well so I didn't want to scare him away by getting touchy or smt) I thought he seemed to enjoy it too and even waited with me for the bus, said yeah when I mentioned we can do it again etc. The thing is when I tried texting him after this he would just stop after some time. At first my friend said he probably isn't reaching out because he has no experience and doesn't know how to go about it (I honestly dont have much experience either, I had a boyfriend before but we kinda skipped the dating part since we were roommates first)At this point I feel like he probably just isn't interested but I feel a little led on...I really don't know and I'm scared of asking him directly. Is there any chance a guy is still interested if he doesn't initiate conversation? He is really present and friendly IRL, albeit a little shy. And I'm really confused by the difference in how we talk online and irl.","If you've confessed to someone and they've rejected you, it can be really confusing. It's possible that they don't want to be together and that's OK. Sometimes people can change their minds and want to be together again - it's worth waiting for them to come back to you. Alternatively, they might not have been ready to accept your confession at that time and it's OK to respect their decision.

"325","I feel insecure about his past actions towards me","When I first met him, he had a girlfriend, and one night, when he was drunk, he told people he was into me. He begged people not to tell me, but they told me. When I asked him, he told me he had a girlfriend, and cut off contact with me. He didn't even want to be social media friends with me. They broke up six weeks later, and the day they broke up, he started looking at my social media. Like, literally everyday. And on multiple platforms, too. But for the better part of a year, it was clear he still had residual feelings for his ex. Four years later, he's back. He Dmed me on Instagram and apologized for what he did.We had our third date. The spark we had picked back up immediately. He's definitely more mature and communicative. However, even though he felt bad about the way things went down, I don't feel pretty enough for him. He's a very good looking guy himself, and people say that I'm prettier than him. But I feel like he's always going to find his ex more attractive. He threw me away once. Not to mention, while he was stalking my social media, he wasn't over his ex. He tried following her on TikTok six months after they broke up, but unfollowed her (probably because she didn’t follow him back). It makes me wonder if he wanted to get back with her. However, he knew I was stalking his social media too, so if he did indeed want to get back with her, and she said yes, he would’ve strung me along again.","You may feel insecure about his past actions towards you if they have made you feel vulnerable or if they have caused you distress.

We are still classmates and have mutual friends (though they don't like him) and live close to another, so complete avoidance isn't possible. The breakup was messy and on bad terms and yesterday was the last time we had contact, to which I then blocked him since. For context, he broke up with me because he believed he shouldn't have gotten a chance to be better and felt this was more ""appropriate"". This led to everyone going against him, essentially calling him a coward and an asshole. He believes I spun our story to make people take my side and alienate him, where as I just confided in my friends and told the full truth (including the bad things I did) and people still took sides, despite me saying not to.I go out with my friends more and I'm learning to enjoy single life (I haven't been single as an adult before, so it's new). I hold hope we may get back together one day if it's meant to be, on the condition he ever understands his wrongdoings and grows. He was still my best friend and first love, so whilst I'm peeved I can't despise him.What else should I do? People say to pick up a new hobby, but what could that be? I no longer feel the need to cry everyday too, I'm over that phase. I don't plan on another relationship soon, though I have snapped a few guys here and there. I quit vaping and started going to the gym too.","It can be tough to move on after a break-up, but it's important to remember that it's not your fault. You were in a relationship, and now it's over.

"327","Tried clothes on outside of the dressing room and stopped for shoplifting.","I went shopping for a new outfit yesterday at a Dillards in a mall. The store was mostly empty because of the holiday (and because it was a mall). I had my spouse with me and we each took a kid in a stroller. I’d already tried on a few dresses in one section, then found a top in a different part of the store that I wanted to try on. There wasn’t an associate there, so I just went to where the mirrors are by the dressing rooms and tried the shirt on over my tank top. I had a sweater on, so I took off the sweater, tried the new shirt on over my tank top, liked it, planned on buying it, took it back off, and put my sweater back on. I had the new shirt back on its hanger and hanging from the stroller when I started looking for my spouse so we could buy it and leave. The associate that got me a changing room for the dresses earlier walked across the store to tell me security called her and told her to come talk to me. She said they saw me changing outside of a changing room while watching me on camera. I said I didn’t mean to cause a problem, that I had a tank top on and just tried the shirt on over that. She kept saying, “you know they have cameras everywhere right?” I felt so weird after that and put the shirt back to leave. I’m fine with the idea of security cameras everywhere, but is it really wrong to try on a shirt the way I did? Or were they watching us closely because of the strollers (I know some people try to shop lift with them)? The stroller I was pushing at the time is just a seat for my four year old. It doesn’t have a bottom to store anything or a shade on top. It’s been a long time since I’ve shopped in actual stores - is it normal to approach customers like that? Should I have done something differently?","Police were called to a store when a woman tried to steal clothes and then left the store.

"328","I am having trouble sexually pleasing my gf and it’s killing me","So, me and my college girlfriend have been seein each other for 2 months. During this time, we’ve had sex almost every night. It’s been great and I’m really attracted to her, but I here’s the issue; I have bad anxiety, so I just started taking lexapro 5mg. Ever since starting lexapro, I am having trouble maintaining an erection. Usually, I can cum, and then still be hard to keep having sex after so she can have an orgasm too, but the last couple times we’ve had sex, I came within a minute and then tried to keep having sex, but I went soft. It not only kills the mood but it kills my confidence as well because I feel that she’s frustrated with me. It seems like I always cum when she’s close to cumming, but I ruin it. There’s been times where she’s literally begged me not to cum because she’s close. And sure, sometimes I don’t I’m right away and she’s able to cum, but it’s been getting worse lately. I want to keep having sex but my dick is thinking differently. So now I’m thinking about quitting lexapro because this side effect is ruining my quality of life. Maybe I stop and then see if it gets better? Idk. I have noticed that when I drink alcohol, the boner issue does not occur. I guess because it counteracts the effect of lexapro?","There could be a number of reasons why you are having difficulty satisfying your girlfriend sexually. This could be due to a number of different factors such as not being completely aroused when you are with her, not being able to reach an orgasm, or simply being less responsive than you used to be.If you are finding it difficult to be as responsive as you would like, then you might want to consider consulting with a sex therapist who can help you work through any issues that may be causing your difficulties.

This brings me to my current predicament. A girl at my work, about the same age as me, has taken this news and think that I can mean she can keep trying sexual advances towards me. For example, she has touched me in very private places, talked about me to co-workers in a very overly sexual way, and has been overly flirtatious towards me.

"330","I think my brother is an idiot","So my brother is 30 years old and his gf is 19…weird af but okay. His gf cheated on him and was paid for sex. So I stopped liking her because I think it’s super foul what she did. She gave my brother an STD while doing that and that’s how he found out. He took her back. But then after he called me saying he couldn’t do it anymore. I was happy saying yeah the relationship is weird and she doesn’t love you. I told him to date someone his age. With no warning he picks me up at the airport and his gf is in the back. I was surprised. The other day I am on the phone with him and he had to go out and I’m like oh where ya heading and him and his gf sounded appalled that I asked and he didn’t tell me. My brother always does this where he sticks up for his gfs. I’m surprised that he did this like I’m ur sister yet now u and ur gf and good u forgot what she did. I asked him to help an uncle and he has the opportunity but he never did. I think he is cold hearted. I don’t think I would like him if we weren’t siblings. He talks to our pedo-rapist brother. I thought it was because of our nieces but no he enjoys being with him ! He lied to our mom saying she is 23. The gf smokes weed all day with him. I stayed over and I heard them having sex while I was in the living room. Wtf ???? I’m starting to realize this is not the sibling I remember from my childhood. I don’t think I like him as a person. I’m sad writing this because I don’t talk to my family and he’s the only one left but I don’t aligned with him. When we found out our brother was a rapist I replied to the family and took me a while to get over the shame and guilt. My brother never acknowledged them ! Wtf…I guess I want to distance myself. Am I over thinking?? Thoughts ? Thank you","I think your brother is an idiot."
"331","Is this Sexual assault or lack of boundaries?","Is this SA or lack of boundaries?So basically last year when I was 18 I just came to uni, I had low self worth because I came out of a sexual abusive situation with my family.One time me and a few people I met last year were talking to each other in a group smoking. As time went everyone was leaving but I stayed so it was me and 2 guys. I was really high and tired and wanted to sleep.One of the guys I had sex with prior said he wanted to take me to my room (I didn’t ask). When we were going he said something along the lines that he excepts to do something and I said no. I didn’t want to do anything because I was talking to a guy at the time  (who later became my bf) and I genuinely didn’t want to do anything. So he said “huh, what do you mean you don’t want to do anything?” In a way that I felt like I had to.So I felt like I had to do it he wanted oral sex so I did it. I know now if I was put in this situation I would argue and say no because I have a higher sense of self worth and I know I don’t have to do any sexual acts If I don’t feel comfortable.Is this SA or just my failure of having boundaries?","This may be classified as a sexual assault if the person forced themselves on the other person without consent."
"332","I don't feel pretty enough for him","When I first met him, he had a girlfriend, and one night, when he was really drunk, he told people he was into me. He begged people not to tell me, but they all told me. When I asked him, he told me he had a girlfriend, and cut off all contact with me. He didn't even want to be social media friends with me. They broke up six weeks later, and literally the day they broke up, he started looking at my social media all the time. Like, literally everyday. And on multiple platforms, too. But for the better part of a year, it was clear he still had residual feelings for his ex. Four years later, he's back. He Dmed me on Instagram and apologized for what he did.We're dating now, and we only just had our third date. The spark we had picked back up immediately. He's definitely a lot more mature and communicative. However, even though he clearly felt bad about the way things went down, I don't feel pretty enough for him. I don't think I ever will. I know I'm a fairly attractive woman, but I don't feel like he finds me attractive. He's a very good looking guy himself, and people say that I'm prettier than him. But I feel like he's always going to find his ex more attractive. He literally threw me away once. I was so thrilled when I found out he was into me all those years ago, but when he cut things off with me, I would spend my time looking in the mirror and thinking, ""if I were prettier, would he have chosen me?"" Not to mention, while he was stalking my social media, he wasn't over his ex. A part of me feels like, if he really did find me so beautiful, why would he try getting back with her?  If they did get back together, would he have left me the way he did the first time? Also keep in mind, he didn't reach out for four years. Not four months. Four years. If he really did like me, why didn't he chase me once he was single?","I don't feel pretty enough for him.This phrase is often used when someone doesn't feel good enough or what they believe is their 'ideal' body type to attract a certain person. This could be someone they are in a relationship with, someone they are interested in, or someone they think is attractive."
"333","how to handle confronting the guy who gave me herpes.","hi. I'm 23m. guy I was seeing casually gave me herpes about a month or so ago...at first I was just suffering through the very painful and humiliating first outbreak. wasn't angry at him at all, just reeling trying to accept that this is permanently in me now. he did not tell me and has played dumb before (""did you just try going anal?"" ""um, no"").after some denial, and after my partner really drove home to me that its *a violation* to be just given an STD without any chance of avoiding it, I'm realizing that what happened wasn't okay, and am feeling... something about it. adjacent to anger. it's biting and bitter. I get why he didn't tell me... he didn't want to be rejected. but come the fuck on!!! my body is different now forever, and this implicates all of my other current and future relationships!!! herpes isn't gross and some part of me is still holds him in positive regard, which is why I'm choosing to confront him rather than just block n ghost, but.... I am neither good with confrontation on my own behalf nor with coping with violation. I have a long history of rape.We're supposed to talk today. Any advice? anyone who's gone through this, did you ever confront them-- how? how did it go? thanks.","The first thing you should do is assess the situation. If you think the guy is deliberately trying to hurt you, you should try to get away from him. If you think the guy is medically incapable of giving you herpes, you can tell him. If you think the guy is just being careless, you can tell him that you are not comfortable with him being near you and explain why. If the guy doesn't take the news well, you can apologize and explain that you didn't mean to hurt his feelings."
"334","Need Outsider Opinion","My partner wants me to lose weight, and has even used me working out as an ultimatum. They push me everyday to workout and/or makes comments about me. Today they were frustrated because I haven't truly been trying and told me to pull up my shirt and pull down my pants a bit so that they could point out all the places I need to get rid of. I got completely naked and they started to talk about my arms, stomach, etc., and then I started to cry and they told me 'this is the only way you will understand'. I am a W, 5'9, 205lbs, hourglass figure, was just at the doctors and I have no health issues at all (had a full checkup and scan), but my doctor told me I need to lose around 25lbs to align a healthy weight with my height. I eat pretty clean but am truly addicted to pop, I drink it a lot, I know I drink it too much and am not active enough to make up for that. I'm just going to workout to appease them because I don't want to feel the way they made me feel, in that moment, again. They say their pushing this because they dont want me to get diabetes or die early and that their looking out for me and our future. I guess I just want an opinion on whether I am overreacting to this or if this is not okay because I know they love me, but today truly changed things for me.","There are many ways to get outside opinion on a topic. Some ways to get outside opinion are to talk to friends, family, or colleagues about the topic; searching online for opinions; or interviewing people who have different perspectives on the topic."
"335","How can I style my hijab and outfit for a formal event (wedding or dinner party)?","As many Muslim women living in the West know, wearing """"modest traditional"""" fashion when with family is a must, even if we dress however we like on any other day. So, I don't have much experience with dressing for formal events such as weddings or dinner parties with (distant) relatives and old family friends. As I was recently invited to such an event, I realized I don't really own a lot of """"appropriate"""" attire and don't really know how to style my hijab and outfit to look stylish but modest.&#x200B;While the internet helped me come up with a few ideas that might help other Muslim women who are in a similar situation, I'm hoping to hear from women on this sub, especially Muslim.&#x200B;One idea I liked is a long, flowing maxi dress in a luxurious fabric such as silk or chiffon, paired with a coordinating hijab in a complementary color (and adding some sparkly accessories). Another is to wear a formal suit or dress pants with a blazer and blouse, again in luxurious fabrics such as silk or satin. A turban-style hijab (or even a simple hijab) with a fancy brooch should also add some elegance.&#x200B;I've also found inspiration from other Muslim women online who share their outfit ideas and styling tips. Many Muslim fashion bloggers and influencers have Instagram pages or YouTube channels where they share their latest looks and outfit ideas, and I'm increasingly falling in love with the designs from [Abaya](https://www.amanis.co.uk/).&#x200B;Finally, are there specific online retailers that cater to Muslim fashion you girls use more than others? And how do they balance fashion and modesty when selecting their outfits?&#x200B;TL;DR: I would love to hear other Muslim women's experiences with dressing for formal events. I would really love to feel """"stylish"""" while also honoring my family's cultural traditions. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!","The most important thing to remember when styling your hijab and outfit for a formal event is to keep things conservative. You don't want to look too flashy or overdone. Stick to classic styles and colors. Try to avoid patterns, brightly colored garments, or cuts that will show off your body too much. Also, avoid wearing too much makeup or insisting on wearing a heavy coat on a warm night. Stick to lighter coverups, accessories, and shoes."
"336","I Haven't got a clue wether this girl is actually still interested","I work with this girl (20), we went on a date back in October and that went well (we'd liked eachother for a while), we went on a second date that went well too. But, the third date even though it was going well, I got extremely drunk and started chatting some girls up Infront of her and one of there bf's and ended up with a black eye by the bf. (I know I'm an idiot)I tried to apologise of course but she wasn't having any of it. We didn't speak for a while even though I see her at work. Then I heard she had a bf in December. But, then she started texting me again when she thought I had a gf, only for the day then blanked me for a month. Then we went on a work night out where she was very drunk and wouldn't leave me alone all night talking about how she knows I have feelins for her and then she started crying about what I did, and was sent home by mates in a taxi.A couple of weeks ago we were together on a work night out again, neither of us were that drunk this time, but we were getting on well and ended up kissing. We started texting again and eventually we met up after work a few days later and just drove around talking, and again kissed. But, then almost the day after the texts slowed down and I had planned to meet her a couple of days after but she said she was meeting her friends instead. So, I decided to text her saying we need to sit and talk about this. We can't keep going back and forth. So, we met and talked. She said she needed time before she could decide wether or not she wants to be with me, it could take months she said. She also was saying she'd understand if I moved on with someone else and I shouldn't have to wait for her. I just don't get what this means. I also asked her if she wanted to be with me and she said yes, but she just can't at the moment. I do really like her though.Has anyone got any advice on what this probably means, try to move on or should I try to persue her?"," or notThere's no way to tell without asking her directly."
"337","How do I get my controlled boyfriend to open up to me?","My boyfriend (M18 and F18) is an incredible person and partner. He is someone who is pretty controlled and really wants to be perceived as good. He cares a lot about how he dresses and has some elitist/classist coded perceptives on etiquette. He makes comments that strike me as odd or dramatic when he goes out in sweat pants (or ""lounge wear"") he says that he’s embarrassed or ashamed in a joking but not joking way and says he looks like a hobo. One time I wore sweat pants and a hoodie to school and later that night he made a comment that I ""obviously didn’t care as much” as him about how I ""go out into the world."" He is super picky about where we go out to eat and avoids/apologizes for anything that he thinks is tacky. All of this seems to strike me as pretty elitist because he associates bad things with stuff that is cheap or made for a lower class. For context both of us are upper middle class and he says he is grateful for how lucky he is but I still feel like his association between cheap/tacky = bad/embarrassing is unnecessary and harmful. He does not comment on my appearance which I really appreciate however I know that he cares about what I look like and how I present myself. This is hard for me to reconcile with because he makes me feel so beautiful and loved but at the same time I know he is judging my appearance. I honestly don’t understand how such a kind and loving person can simultaneously be so judgmental. I know he would not break up with me for wearing sweat pants but it is weird that he cares so much. Aside from controlling his appearance, he is very good at controlling social situations and is liked by everyone he meets. He controls how he talks and what he talks about. I have come to realize that he is not super introspective and I don’t think he is even aware of why he is the way he is. When I asked him about why he cares so much he says that it makes sense to him and that he has just been conditioned to think this way. This is all fine but I think all of this comes with some vulnerability, honesty and control issues that he is not addressing. I want us to deepen our connection and understanding of one another. I want to help him open up and start to reflect on his assumptions and biases. I am most concerned with the way he talks to himself because if he is so judgmental with other people, I can only imagine how harsh he is to himself. I would really appreciate it if anyone has any insights or advice on this situation and thank you for helping me!","There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to get your controlled boyfriend to open up to you may vary depending on the situation. However, some tips that may be useful in this situation include being patient, doing your research, and being supportive. Additionally, it may be helpful to consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you explore the dynamics of your relationship and help you open up to your boyfriend in a more constructive way."

He’s significantly older and a granddad already. I’m in my 40’s. We were seeing each other for 1.5 years. Not easy between me working fulltime and being a mother and his job takes him away a bit. He doesn’t want to live together as says he’s too old and had his time raising kids. He’s 63. I don’t need a stepdad for her. I wish he would try engage with her though and make a bit of an effort. I broke it off almost 13 months ago and we’ve been talking but not spending time together. He’s constantly asking me to be his girlfriend again. I do love him still but not sure what to do. My daughter doesn’t care if I date him but there’s several issues and I don’t know if I’m being immature:-He pushed me aside sexually in favour of self gratification to porn. My needs were not met. He didn’t care. I told him it hurts my feelings and he told me not to try change him. He’s not going to stop looking at porn dailyHe doesn’t apologise. He blames me for all arguments. Especially as I’m younger, so he says I have less life experience. If he’s angry he will go silent for couple days, tells me to shut the F up or F offWhen I explain my feelings to him he just trivialises it saying I’m too intense and being immature and drama Queen. He talks to ex girlfriends and has 2 phones which are both personal. I get suspicious and he says I’m too paranoid and must grow up.He gets mad when I help anyone out whether it’s my time or finances. He dislikes most of my friends.He mocks me for believing in God.He tells me how to parent my daughter. He says he’s just trying to help me and guide me because I’m naive.He says one day when my daughters grown up I can move in with him - for a nominal rent. He owns his house, financially comfortable. Not sure why I’d have to pay rent? But if I’ve ever been short of money he’s offered to loan me some. He’s told me 3 times I look like his ex wife.Despite the above, he can be affectionate and caring. He’s a hard worker. Has a good relationship with his adult children. He’s mature, independent and intelligent. Very tidy and organised. Domesticated. Great with his animals. He says if I don’t make a decision soon about getting back with him, he will cut contact.

I grew up taking care of my younger siblings; I am the oldest of them, and two of them are girls. Recently, my younger siblings have been acting out and treating me like a complete idiot. Every night, they come into my room and ask for things, and when I say no, they literally throw a fit like a toddler.

I tell my parents about everything they do,And nothing is done about it Last night I locked my door and went to bed. I woke up around 2:30 a.m to find them banging on my door asking for a charger, even though they both have their own and there are multiple chargers they could use if theirs were broken. They didn't need to do that.

First, talk to them about what is bothering you. If there is a problem that needs to be addressed, be sure to take action either individually or as a group. Speak up if you feel like you’re not being heard or your concerns aren’t being taken seriously. Additionally, it may be helpful to set boundaries with your sisters. This could mean not joining in on their jokes or gatherings, or refusing to help them with their projects. It may take some effort, but ultimately being assertive and standing up for yourself will likely make your sisters respect you more."
"343","My (16M) friend (also 16M) has started sending me lewd photos.","I should preface this by saying that we have been going to the same school for over a year now, but haven’t started talking until recently. We are both openly gay, but since we go to a very small school neither of us ever made a move. I use the term “friend” very loosely, since we both actually used to dislike eachother. About a month ago we added eachother on snapchat and we started getting closer. At the time it was simply platonic. But about 2 weeks ago he started sending me snaps of him lying in his underwear at 10:00 at night. Since I liked this and it wasn’t jus a one off occurence, I started reciprocating the same sort of pictures.After a week this progressed to full on n00d pictures and videos. These photos and videos happened two night consecutively. But since then he seems kinda indifferent to me (especially irl). I’ve asked him once or twice what his intentions are, to which he usually replies “no idea”. Since I don’t want to make the situation anymore awkward I usually just drop the topic there. I once saved a snap of him in a towel (not exposed) to see how he would react. He thought that it was fine that I saved the snap, just asked me not to show anyone. He also sometimes flirts with me in other ways, compliments on my body/outfit and sometimes some physical contact (although he is just the kind of person that regularly hugs his fully platonic friends). But this brings me to question that I need advice on. Is he being distant because he is afraid of pursuing a relationship and what people at our school might think? Or is he just using me when he’s bored alone at night?TL;DR my gay friend and I have been trading n00ds, is he using me or is there a possibility for a relationship?","This could mean anything from your friend thinking you're sexy and trying to fuel your ego, to them being serious about wanting to have sex with you.

I’ve explained to him several reasons why I don’t like this, e.g. no notice in advance, I prefer our alone time in the evenings, lack of privacy (we live in a small apartment, one shower). I’m also 9 months pregnant due any day and I really don’t want the extra dishes, laundry etc that comes with guests. I want to enjoy these last few days of peace and quiet! His reasoning is that he wants to spend time with his family, which is totally fine but why can’t he do that during the day? Why is a sleepover necessary? We’ve talked about it and he agreed to give me more advance notice if he was planning to have them over. However he hasn’t lived up to that and they’re still coming with no notice. I’m getting more upset and also worried this is going to continue after the baby comes which will just be even worse. Am I overreacting? Or how can we compromise on this?

When I was still pregnant, I told him that if he didn’t come clean that I would. And he asked me to do it after the holidays because the holidays were “important” to his loved ones. And my stupid ass still kept his secret. I’ve been medicated for depression for two months now and seeked for help and honestly I still want to tell her. Not because I want them to break up, but because she deserves to know and he needs to be held accountable for his actions. They are a huge part of their church (he literally goes to church twice a week and plays the piano there and goes to bible studies???) and he told me that if everyone found out what he did, he will quite literally lose everyone. At this point though, I don’t care what happens to him. I just want his girlfriend to have all the information because she deserves to know. I feel guilty letting her think that he has always been a god-fearing, loyal, and honest man that he clearly never was.What would you do?","There is no definitive answer, as it depends on the specific situation. If you believe that your partner is cheating on you, it is important to assess the situation and weigh your options carefully. Depending on the facts of the particular case, you may decide to keep the information to yourself, or speak with a trusted friend or family member about what you know. If you decide to disclose information to someone outside of your relationship, be sure to do so in a confidential and safe way."
"347","Any tips to cope with a job I hate but can't afford to quit?","So, for context I(24f) am currently studying at university and I work in the call center industry. I live with my partner and we have some pets that need special medical care. I worked as waitress for a couple years but joined the callcenter cause in my country is better paid an allows me to work from home. My partner is also a student and tries to help with living expenses as much as possible, but I'm the main provider for our home.I've been on this job for over two years and those who work in service know how exhausting it can be. I hate my job right now and it stresses me a lot. I've spoked to my partner about this and they  have been very supportive but the true is that I can't quit. No other jobs with this kind of salary are available since I'm not professional and as much I hate it, it pays the rent and allows us to live good even with the veterinary expenses.I feel like a complete failure. I know that some people work for decades a job they hate to support their families and I should be able too. Also this is supposed to be temporary. Just a couple more years until I graduate. But I fell like I'm drowning and just thinking about going to work makes me sad. Any advice to cope with the feelings my job causes me?","There are many ways to cope with a job you hate but can't afford to quit. One option is to try to find a job that is more compatible with your skill set and interests. Another option is to look for ways to reduce the amount of time you spend at your job. For example, you could try to find shorter hours or switch to a part-time position. Finally, you can try to find ways to make the job more enjoyable or reduce the amount of stress you feel at work."
"348","Trauma is hindering me from working","I work as a cashier in a grocerie store. Not only does this job require constant and excellent customer service, it requires the ability to observe and subtly prevent potential thieves from stealing. Seems simple enough, yet it's the exact opposite, especially at self checkout. I've recently noticed that our upfront mangers have been cherry-picking certain cashiers to supervise self checkout stations more often than others, me especially. They pick the cashiers who seem ""better"" at supervising self checkout than others. This has taken a massive toll on me and has become severely stressful. Today I just broke down while on the clock because I can't take it anymore. To watch self checkout, you have to answer to every single customer that comes through. Do age checks, suspend orders, clean the area, put up bags, search things for people, change prices on products, check receipts, all while keeping a close eye on each and every single person with a cart-full of stuff that comes through, which can reach up to 30 people. You HAVE to approach thieves in a kind and inconspicuous manner as to not rile them up in case they want to harm you and other customers, or of they get the bright idea to sue the company. Because the theft has become out of hand, Asset Protection has also become increasingly strict on us. I have past trauma that goes from sexual abuse to psychological/emotional abuse at a young age. I've healed mostly, but sometimes I crack when I get too overwhelmed. These recent changes have been getting to me, and the way I've been getting spoken to by higher-ups is a little triggering. I understand they want us to prevent this loss, but I am only one person, and a broken one at that getting paid a mediocre amount per hour. I'd like some advice on how to help a person like me with their stressful job, because we're getting more self-checkout stations soon and I can't be doing this for the remainder of the time I'll be spending working there. Can't be crying for something I signed up for."," on my projectTrauma is a very real issue and can hinder progress on any project. If you feel that your trauma is interfering with your ability to work on your project, please talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through the issue."
"349","My brother stole my firearms before I was 18 and sold them to get himself better ones","Now, let me explain quite a bit.I am 18, turned 18 in January, my brother is like 30 something.My father passed away October of 2017 and he had no will and me being his only biological child and son he throughout my entire life told me I would get his guns. He collected firearms like no other, he had hundreds of guns and was pretty well-known on some firearm websites such as MarlinOwners. After his passing my family sold at least 90% of his firearms and my mother let my brothers have pick of quite a few of his guns but she made sure to leave some good ones for me for when I turned 18. Now believe it or not, I was actually no longer living with my family at age 15 and my mother lives out of city and wanted no reminders of my father with her new husband, such as his guns; but for some reason is okay with his truck and let's her new husband drive MY DAD'S truck, and yes, he's already damaged it, like ""smashed out the rear windshield"" kinda damaged it. But so my sister had my guns, as she lives in-town, and my brother knew my sister wouldn't ask questions if he were to go over to her house and ask for the safe keys and take a few guns, so he did exactly that. And he thought he got away with it, but then his son tells my fiancé's little sister and my sister that his dad sold my dad's guns for cooler ones.So I find out about this eventually and am even more despising of this guy as he's also the reason the bike my father bought me the month he passed was sold at a garage sale hosted by other brother because he told him ""it wasn't important""So here I am now, 18, legally allowed to carry a firearm, but have none to carry anymore because of my piece of shit brother took them and sold them. What should I do? I want to confront him but him and I haven't gotten along since I was maybe 6, I pretend to be buddy-buddy with him just to not stress out my mother but really I hate the guy's guts.Thank you guys for any and all advice",".Your brother may have stolen your firearms, but he may have also done it to get better ones. There are many reasons why someone might steal firearms, and the motivations can vary from person to person. Some people may steal firearms to get money to purchase other things, others may do it to get firearms out of the house so they can't be used against them or others, and still others may steal firearms because they think they can sell them for a higher price. In any case, your brother may have done what he did for a reason, and it's up to you to decide whether you want to forgive him or not."

Anyways everything was great afterwards, and then all the sudden she started hating me for no reason. She started COMPLETELY ignoring to the point where other co workers were noticing it and even a co worker said “either you guys are dating and trying not to make it obvious or she hates your ass”, anyways I just ignored her, cause I mean that’s her problem, but it’s when she started hating on me for no reason and making my job harder where it starts to bother me. In return I just started completely ignoring her and keeping my distance in a professional way ( only talk to her when I have to ), and that made things worse, she’s being on my ass for every thing I do LITERALLY, she’s obviously being more strict with me compared to other co workers, I just don’t get it.

I was a terrible partner. We have a 3 year old so we’re always going to be in contact. We still live together. She agreed to try to start over by being just friends/roommates/coparents. I had substance abuse issues since before I met my fiance, and I decided a month ago to sober up for myself, so I could be a bettter partner and father. That’s why it hurt so much when she broke up with me today. I’ve been doing better. I lost my license at 17 because of a dui and I’ve gotten pulled over abt 6 times since then. I have to pay 1600 in fines and get an ignition interlock before i can even get a date that i’ll get my license back. I got a letter in the mail today that I got 1100 more in fines and a 60 day jail sentence for driving on a suspended license. I got until april 21st to turn myself in. I can’t get a job i’ve been applying to everywhere in my city and nowhere will call me. I get an interview 20+ minutes away and my grandparents bitch and won’t give me a ride. My grandparents (66f 60m) only talk down to me. They treat me terribly. Always tell me how shitty of a person I am for not working, telling me I’m lazy for not working.

"355","Been feeling lost. Seeking advice for different career path/change due to contact dermatitis!","Hello all! I'm a healthcare worker seeking advice for any potential career paths due to health/work related issues. I developed contact dermatitis at my workplace and it has been leaving my hands severely dry and scarred. It has significantly lowered my self esteem because patients and/or coworkers think I'm contagious at first glance. It's tiring to keep explaining this to other people. Overall, it's just exhausting having to order and use specific products that nobody else on the unit uses. Don't get me wrong, my workplace has accommodated me very well. It's exhausting to explain why I'm the only one on the unit with specific products to use. It also bothers me that people still use my stuff even though my name's on it. I've had several warehouse and retail jobs in the past which I didn't really like all that much. So I decided to go into healthcare since it was stable and I'm able to make an impact on people's lives. But my condition has been really bothering me and has been making me reconsider if I should continue in healthcare or go on a different path entirely. I want to explore my options first before I decide if I should go back to school or not, because that requires time and money. What would you do in my shoes? Or what advice would you give me?","One option is to see a dermatologist who may be able to help you find a different career that doesn't require contact with people.

"356","Is there something wrong with me?","I put 100% effort into making the people I care the most about happy. I tend to buy things for my SO and friends because I genuinely feel a sense of happiness when I see that they are having a good time. I feel that sometimes I can come off as someone who tries to buy their friendship, which I hate the thought of.I would sometimes have one-on-one conversations with friends to see how they are doing if I feel that something might be bothering them. Often the friends I talk to and have a deeper connection with are girls, and I feel that sometimes this may lead to misunderstandings. I may be overthinking this, but that's what I feel. I don't want to be labeled as the guy in the group that's always trying to get with a girl in the group, because that's not what I'm trying to do.I broke up with my SO around 4 months ago, and I think I'm completely over it. Lately, I've been missing the times we shared where it was just the two of us playing video games together. I feel like I might be trying to get that feeling from my friends but it just doesn't feel the same, and I understand that. I think the break-up had taken a toll on my self esteem, and I have been getting quite nasty thoughts about the people around me. For example, they are just asking about my day out of pity and that I was quite expendable to the friend group. If I disappear from the group nothing will change.Lately, work has been quite stressful and I have fallen quite ill. Normally, I would check up on friends when they are sick by shooting them a message asking if they are doing alright. For me, I didn't receive any messages asking me if I was doing alright or anything like that. I don't expect and demand anything from my friends, but I feel slightly hurt that no one really seemed to care about my well-being as much as I cared about theirs. I don't want to be petty, but it's just been a lingering thought I've been having lately and I hate it.I'm just wondering if I'm doing too much sometimes, and need to take a step back. This isn't the first friend group where I feel expendable. Maybe it's just a state of mind, but I've just been having a hard time mentally.","There is nothing wrong with you.

"357","Do I suck for leaving","Last week my mom and I were talking about a serving gig I worked. It was my first time taking on a freelance gig so it was new to me. Anyways she started asking me how I got the money which I replied with “They put the money on my card”Because they did, the money was transferred into my account directly. After she heard that she scolded me for giving my information out and said I was stupid. I reassured her I did research on the company but my mother is very… opinionated And by that I mean she’s always right and nobody can tell her she’s wrong. Well we started fighting more about this topic until she apparently felt disrespected and told me to “pack my bags and leave” even though I didn’t say anything except the truth she just didn’t like what I said. So anyways  that’s exactly what I did.I packed 2 bags full of shit and got out. After I left she called me explaining how she felt disrespected and that I was dumb for giving my banking information out to “strangers” to which I replied “I’m not ten and I’m not going to give my banking to some STRANGER.” Because it’s true I did research the company before I provided my information. Ive been staying at my grandmas house, slept in my car , and I also went up to Santa Cruz for a day. after around 3 days of my absence my mom texted me asking to talk so after a few days I went back home to talk.

So lately I’ve been in a really bad place and it’s all started in late 2022.Me (F15-16) was at school and I had a best friend (F15) we will call her emily.Emily and I were inseparable, emily had her faults.. blocking me when my uncle died because she thought I was jealous of her calling my ex, telling everyone 🍆 meant more to her than me, getting everyone to hate me because I skipped a sleepover, telling me she wasn’t aloud to hangout and hanging out with other people, being besties with people that hate me and skipping my 16th birthday for a work dinner and smoking with other friends. Which according to her is all laughable and excusable???Anyways I got sick of it and we lost touch in the holidays after my birthday.I haven’t spoke to her other than asking her how she’s going ect. And then last Monday she messaged me.“Stop talking shit”I reply confused and it bursts into this huge thing of how I said something I didn’t say and my boyfriend(17M) told someone else because someone else wanted to know why I hate them. She proceeded to call me manipulative, a liar, tell me she’s turning my friends against me and say that I’m self centred. I told her to talk to my boyfriend since he said what upset her because I didn’t say anything and quite literally didn’t know what was going on. She accused me of throwing him under the bus? Turned out my boyfriend who is often forgetful said the wrong persons name.Lost emily we aren’t friends.Within the next hour I got a message from someone else similar thing. I explained my bf said the wrong name and I didn’t really understand what was happening etc. they called me similar things to emily and insecure and more. Now I’ve found two of my friends have hated me for ages and all my other friends(3 people) + my boyfriend are associated with the people that said horrible things to me and hate me.People can be friends with who they want but it kind of hurts to?

"359","How do I reconcile with an extremely bad work situation? It's been a year.","It was my first ever job after university.It was a small community pharmacy.I was the intern.My direct supervisor got fired, but management was planning his dismissal even before I arrived.I ended up resigning because of my involvement and how the dismissal process was so chaotic.Basically, I never gossiped at work. But when a coworker started venting about my supervisor, I started to join in, which was a mistake looking back.Then that coworker relayed everything I said to the manager. And the manager grabbed that opportunity to take me out to lunch during work on company time the very next day.And the manager slid a piece of paper and pen in front of me. I tried saying no, but she shook her head.I knew it was wrong to write bad stuff down about my supervisor.But the manager said it's the right thing to do. And the manager was revealing horrible things about my supervisor. And she paid for my lunch. As soon as I finished writing, she took the piece of paper away from me, I didn't have a chance to read it, or decide if I want to submit it.Then I felt so much guilt for a week.I ended up telling my supervisor in advance that he was going to get fired.And then my supervisor cut ties with me.I learnt a lot of lessons.But I wish I had just stood up for myself and just walked away from the lunch, and never got involved in someone else's dismissal.I really hate how I didn't follow my gut instinct that this was all wrong, I didn't speak up, I was a people pleaser.","It sounds like you might need some time to process how your situation has gone so poorly.

"360","My doorman made up a fake story to solicit GoFundMe donations from residents and now won’t talk to me because I refused to donate. What should I do?","Hey guys. This is kind of a wild story. I live in an apartment building lucky enough to have a doorman/concierge. The residents have a Facebook group that he’s in. Last week, he posted a GoFundMe link saying he had gotten into not 1, but 2 (!) car accidents and he needed help to pay for car and medical bills for him and his girlfriend. People start donating, and then he shows up at work the next day totally fine. Every time I walked in and out of the building though, I saw him basking in the attention of some resident whom he had accosted to tell the story to and it just seemed awkward because he had put that person on the spot to donate and I overheard the resident awkwardly apologizing. So me being the type of person that I am, I pulled all car accident reports that are in the county and neighboring counties. I find only one with his name as a party to it within the past 2 weeks. I start getting suspicious. Upon clicking the report, I see it detailed no injuries to anyone. Anyways, he seems to be keeping tabs on who donated and who didn’t (no donation was anonymous) and now every time I walk by he turns his head and won’t say hello because I didn’t donate or even send condolences because the story is clearly exaggerated if not outright false (he has car insurance!) and the shameless way he’s trying to make residents feel bad for not donating grates on me. This is a big change from before, where he always greeted me as I passed by and offered to help bring out my packages. I can’t even talk to him anymore (or pick up my packages) when he’s working his shift now (which is 9-5 every day). What should I do?","If you spoke to your doorman about his fake GoFundMe story, and he refused to stop fundraising on your behalf, then you may want to consider speaking to legal counsel. It may be possible to sue him for making false claims about the fundraising campaign, as well as potential damages that may have come from donors who participated in the fundraiser. Additionally, you may want to speak to your building manager about how to handle this situation - your doorman is not allowed to solicit donations without your consent, and if he continues to do so without your approval, your building manager may be able to take action."

I’ve never been like this in my life. I wake up everyday at 5am and go to the library, do all my homework and then go to classes go to library after: all because im doing cocaine. And im also so so happy too. Things that upset me and made me depressed don’t make me depressed. I can stop. On the weekends I don’t study so I don’t do cocaine. But on the week days I do cocaine all the time. Also I live in Scotland so it keeps me warm too. Cocaine has saved my degree and my life.

"363","i want to confess to my crush and then block him","fuck it, lets just call him wolfwolf and i were friends for a while, but we didn’t start texting regularly until december, and we bonded really fast. we would call every day and night, and i would fall asleep and he would stay up and wait for me. then he would fall asleep and i’d wait for him (time zone vibes yk) and one night, he told me that he couldn’t fall asleep without me. so of course my little grinch heart defrosted.my sister is never home anymore, but we’re still close, but wolf really filled that hole for me. we would watch movies and youtube videos and he would play the guitar for me and we even made a song, but then shit hit the fan. he told me he has a girlfriend, but the only reason he’s dating her, is because she’s “the only white person” in his neighborhood. he’s also apparently very racist and has straight up said that he hates mixed people. i am mixed.his girlfriend dumped him, and he would keep texting me about how much he loved and missed her. he talked about her the way i felt about him, and it made me physically nauseous. i’d start tearing up on our calls and lie and say i had to go. i’m 20, this is not my first “crush fail,” i’ve never been in a relationship, but i don’t know why this one hurts so much it’s been two weeks since i’ve texted him back, and he actually texted one of my friends to ask if i was okay, which made me feel like shit, but i can’t be his friend anymore. he’s literally admitted to being racist, so why is it so hard for me to let go of him? he was genuinely a really good friend, but i cannot be his friend anymore, but i feel like i should send him one last text instead of just completely ghosting him and blocking him? is this too much? i basically just wanted to explain why i ghosted him for so long and why we can’t be friends, and then block him so i won’t have to see his response","There is no good or bad answer to this question; it depends on your own preferences. Some people may want to confess and then work things out, while others may want to completelyignore the person after confessing. Ultimately, it is up to you."
"364","I (16M) would like some advice for my relationship with my girlfriend (16F)","About a month ago I found the courage to tell my crush I like her and she said yes to a date. This is my second ever relationship and I have a bit of a fear of dating because the first one did not go well. To make a long story short I pushed things to far to fast and my ex ended up breaking up with me, I understand now that it was completely my fault but at the time it devastated it also didn't help that I was suffering from a bad depression at the time which I think affected the relationship. That was about 2 years ago and today my depression and insecurities about myself are practically gone and I've regained confidence in myself, however I have a lot of fears and insecurities about my current relationship like for example that it's not going well and that I'm not good enough for her and things like that. To give you a bit of insight on the situation, as I stated above my depression has mostly gone away, I still have therapy and take medication but it has improved immensely, on the other hand my girlfriend has incredibly bad social anxiety  to the point where she cancelled our first date because she was too anxious, and she also used to take antidepressants and do therapy. Another thing is that we are in the same class but never talk to each other at school and just stay in our own friend group although she is often alone because of her (and partly mine) social anxiety and I feel bad for that, we do sometimes talk on DMs after school but I don't know if  that makes it better, we do however go out every weekend. I also don't know how to progress the relationship the most physical contact we've had is me putting my arm around her when we  were watching a movie. I really like her and she seems to like me too but I don't know if I'm a good enough boyfriend and how to better myself if I'm not.TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend don't talk much because of her social anxiety and I'm afraid I'm not a good boyfriend and I don't know how I can be a better boyfriend","There are a lot of things you can do to improve your relationship with your girlfriend. Here are a few tips to get you started:1. Communicate with your girlfriend. Being able to communicate with your girlfriend is key to having a successful relationship. Make sure you are communicating regularly, both verbally and nonverbally. This can be done through conversation, texting, email, or any other means of communication.2. Be supportive. One of the most important things you can do for your girlfriend is be supportive. This means being there for her when she needs you, listening to her when she talks, and correcting her when she is wrong.3. Be committed. Another important thing you can do for your girlfriend is be committed. This means being there for her, no matter what. If she needs you to be there for her, be there. If she needs you to let her alone, let her be.4. Give her time. Finally, give your girlfriend time. This means going out with her, doing things with her, and spending time with her. Don’t expect her to do the same things with you that she does with her other friends. Let her enjoy being around you and spend time together."

While I'm not messy, my gf is quite extreme when it comes to tidying up so everything needs to be put away straight away nothing is allowed to be out of place etc. While I'm not as tidy as she is, I'll try to ensure I keep as close to her standards as I can. This works fine most of the time but a problem we're having is she's started tidying up my desk.I tend to leave notes out on my desk that I'll need for meetings the following day, it's not messy but not completely tidy but it's my space so I feel like I should be allowed to do what works best for me within reason. My gf has started tidying up my notes and papers on a night and putting them into a pile. This means she'll close the notebooks I've been using so I lose the pages I was at and if I have a meeting straight away the next day sometimes it takes me a while to find my notes.I tried talking to my gf about it and she just says I shouldn't leave it messy. I point out it's my space and I don't go and move things on her desk or where her things are and she just said I should tidy up the desk and not leave things out. I told her to stop moving things on the desk from now on since they're my things and if I leave something out then there's a reason for it but she just said she doesn't like seeing the mess.

"366","My (21m) partner (20f) knows all and is never wrong","I’ve been with my partner now for 1 year. I don’t remember one single instance, big or small when she admitted being wrong. It can be down to small debates over simple things like the pronunciation of the plural possessive of the word “kids’” for example or larger issues. Things that she is obviously wrong about, confirmable by many sources, but she refuses to acknowledge and feels personally attacked when even questioned… let alone confronted. How do I handle this? She’s not stupid, but whenever I question her claims or arguments she shuts down. I never confront her thinking, but rather question her arguments and on occasion show some legitimate proof that she is wrong, and if we are on FaceTime she hangs up and won’t reach out the rest of the day, and in person she stops speaking all together for hours. It’s never an attack on her, I always am just addressing the topic we are debating, but she always sees it as me personally attacking her. I admit I’m wrong about things multiple times a day, big and small. I don’t remember a single time *ever* when she did. The only way we’ve moved past these things is just by forgetting about them, as I get nowhere even when I try to healthily debate those issues.TL;DR: my partner supposedly knows everything about everything, including general knowledge, my career and facts about my areas of expertise, and is never wrong about anything. Feels personally attacked when questioned on her arguments that are supposedly always right and shuts down, not ever accepting proof that she is certainly wrong. I don’t remember one single time in the past year when she admitted being wrong… I do it multiple times a day about things big and small.","There is no right or wrong answer to this question - it depends on your personal relationship with your partner. Some people feel very confident in their partner's knowledge, while others may feel more confidant in having an open dialogue with their partner about anything and everything. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what level of trust and communication they feel comfortable with."
"367","My (31m) friend (35m) is a downer, im wondering if I shoud just end the connection","My (31m)  friend (35m) is just a miserable bastard. We are from a country where negative and dark humour is funny (up to a point), but we don't live there any more. He is to be fair to him going through a tough breakup relationship wise, but he's always been like this somewhat.Whenever I bring him round mates he just comes with this weird negative energy that makes everyone, including myself feel really uncomfortable. I've actually lost new platonic relationships after introducing them to him. He's in my mind a good guy, but fuck me. I don't know...yesterday he was just miserable and turned a few good conversations weird.He also when he's drunk just says some really inappropriate things in the middle of a conversation (saying things out of nowhere), he actually made a racist remark yesterday under his breath, which I was like ""huh?!"" as I am a black guy and now I think about it is extremely concerning. I don't know if it was part of his ""dark humor"" or what, but goddam now I write all this stuff out i'm like why am I still friends with this guy?!The reason is just that we've known each other for like 5 years. He's stuck by me through bad times, and I feel I have to do the same with him. I don't have many close friendships and ending one over my personal feelings just seems like a bad idea. Has anyone else gone through anything like this?TL;DR my friend is a downer, considering dumping him","There is no universal answer to this question, as every person is different and will react to different things in different ways. Some people may find that their friend is motivating and supportive, while others may find that they are negative and drag them down. Ultimately, the best decision for you may be to decide what works best for you and your friendship."
"368","Does my (F33) partner (M43) have an alcohol problem?","I’ve caught him numerous times the past year sneaking cans of beer and not wanting me to know. He has outright lied to my face about it too.We have had conversations about how I value honesty and I don’t like how slippery and inaccurate he can be with his words sometimes. I often feel like I have to dig the truth of a situation out of him and it is exhausting. He has said he will try to be more truthful but yesterday I caught him throwing away a can after walking around from the side of the house, and he straight up lied about what he was drinking and what he was doing there.In unguarded moments he has admitted to having an alcohol problem, other times completely denies it and puts it on me, saying I’m ‘controlling’ or ‘bossy’, or saying I’m making a big deal of nothing. The thing is he doesn’t get verbally abusive or blind drunk or have serious problematic behaviours when he drinks. Sometimes he gets really absent and honestly it’s he like he gets a bit dumb. He holds his alcohol extremely well usually. I have had conversations with his parents who emphatically thing he is an alcoholic. When I talk to him about this he says they have no idea what they are talking about.The whole thing has me regularly feeling confused and heartbroken (and debilitates my everyday functioning). It’s quite triggering for me because my father was an alcoholic (more of the verbally abusive binge drinker kind). I’m concerned this could be the start of a slippery slope and not something I’m prepared to support someone through honestly.I’m seriously considering leaving the relationship as this isn’t the only ‘baggage’ he has. That’s a whole other post.Looking for some perspective.TLDR: boyfriend denies alcohol problem but will lie about drinking even though consequences could be worse.","Your partner may have an alcohol problem if they exhibit behaviors such as becoming incautious or reckless when drinking, drinking to the point where they are unable to function, or recurrent alcohol misuse. If your partner has any of these behaviors, they should see a doctor or therapist for help."
"369","I (22F) got broken up with (19M) because he realized he doesn’t have romantic feelings for me anymore","I’m just having a hard time processing and mentalizing what just happened. This entire week he was quite withdrawn and I guess he wasn’t as affectionate as before but especially this week, I could notice it. I asked him if everything was alright and if we were okay because I got anxious and he said it is okay. I did trust that and just tried to support him by small messages because I thought he was going through a bad time and he said he wasn’t feeling the best. I didn’t want to force him to tell me what the issue was so I just was patient and let himKnow I’m always there. This was at the beginning of the week, fast forward today and he called me and told me he doesn’t love me anymore, he liked me as a person. We were together for the first 6 months and I had to move out of the country for 6 months. We had taken a trip together two weeks ago and he was really affectionate and I had the best time, he felt like home. But he said after the trip he realized that he wasn’t in love with me. He said that he was blinded by love initially that he never paid attention to our differences. That took me by surprise because we have different hobbies and maybe he is a bit more introverted but in terms of value, character and future goals we do align. I always joined in on him gaming and his shows as well because I wanted to do the things he loved together, fromtime to time. i just don't know how to process this. i feel like i never got to be part of the decision. we did discuss a bit but he just apologizes and tells me he wishes he didn't feel this way.TLDR my bf broke up with me out of the blue because he realized he wasn’t in love with me and I didn’t see it coming because we traveled together a few weeks before and it was magical and he was affectionate and romantic.","There could be a number of reasons why (22F) got broken up with (19M). One possibility is that (19M) realized he doesn't have romantic feelings for (22F) anymore. Another possibility is that (22F) and (19M) had different expectations about their relationship and it didn't work out accordingly. Whatever the reason, it's disappointing for both parties involved."
"370","Me (M26) and Girlfriend (F27) broke up 3 weeks ago, then found out she has been 2 months pregnant. What would(or did) you do in this situation?","TL;DR below So long story short, me and my gf had been together for 5 years. the relationship got so toxic (communication-wise) she's not open to discourse, she thinks any critique of her attitude or personality is an attack.and I have the habit of coming off too strong at times. I'm sure I have more flaws, but I think this is the main problem. so we called it quits maybe 3 weeks ago. we've done that before but we never really ever broke up. never started to talk to other people, etc. this time however, I was serious. I just started talk to another girl for the first time in 5 years.. then... turns out my gf is pregnant. (2 months along) I have no suspicions of it being anyone else. but we've been trying to work our relationship out after finding out, but I don't think I can. she's just so hard to talk to.  she has a bratty attitude about a lot of things, I try to suggest changing her attitude since she's going to have a little one learning from her. but any suggestion I give her it's like I'm talking to a brick wall.I rather just shut my mouth and give up. I just can't believe this is happening to me. my ""fairytale"" idea was to settle down and have a child with one girl. don't get me wrong, aside from the flaws, she's a great person. but I don't think I can ignore these flaws.My main question, have any of you been through anything similar? how do you co-parent in a healthy manner? pretty soon we're gonna break the news to our family, they're gonna want us to get married but I don't think I'm gonna go that route. I dont think i can be married and in a relationship with someone this hard headed. Now when we argue, she says shit along the lines of ""At least I'm not bitter and will still let you see your kid"" Hearing her say stuff like that pisses me off because it's usually out of the blue and has nothing to do with the conversation. besides, who TF thinks of shit like that if they're not like that?? Can co-parenting be healthy? is it possible to 50/50 a newborn?Do you have a similar story? if so, has it been hell or did it work out well? TL;DR:Me and GF of 5 years broke up 3 weeks ago, found out she's 2 months pregnant, (99.9% sure it's mine). Relationship toxic, we've been trying to work it out, but I don't think I can deal with her. Gonna break the news to family, they'll want us married, but I don't want to be with her. at least not in her current state.","His Girlfriend is 2 months pregnant and they have just broken up. He would want to be supportive of her and the child."
"371","This girl[25F] I'm[24M] dating is indecisive about us after a good night together?","So I've been dating this girl I've known for awhile for about 2 weeks. We've gotten intimate multiple times and have gone on a few dates and had a great time. Unfortunately, after a great night out and more intimate time, she woke up very distant. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she needed time and space to think for awhile. When she texted me back a few hours later she let me know that she was fine now but was overthinking things. She has anxiety and other mental issues so I kind of assumed it was something along those lines.  When I asked for more information she said it was about our relationship, and that she was getting anxious and scared. So I asked her if she wanted to just take a step back, but she told me she wanted to give it more time before she made a choice and that we can keep what we were doing now. She then asked me to shelf the conversation for now.  I'm kind of confused on where to go with it from here though. I really like her and was enjoying our time together, so I want to give her time, but at the same time it kind of feels weird to me. I'm confused on how I feel about it because I think I might be afraid she's just using me for emotional support and sex. Or maybe I'm just in my head? I'd like some advice on where to go from here or how to figure out my feelings about this better.  tl;dr: Girl I'm dating woke up unsure about us. Changed her mind and said she was overthinking things. She wants to give it a month or so until she decides to move foward or backwards. And I'm unsure how I feel about it all.","This girl[25F] I'm[24M] dating is likely considering ending our relationship after a good night together because she feels like she can't decide what she wants from us. She may feel like she's not sure if she wants to keep seeing us or end things because she feels like we're not on the same page or in the same direction."
"372","UPDATE: How do I (24F) tell my friend (26F) that she has ruined our friendship?","Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11qqdc0/how\_do\_i\_24f\_tell\_my\_friend\_26f\_that\_she\_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11qqdc0/how_do_i_24f_tell_my_friend_26f_that_she_has/)Thanks for the advice on original, just wanted to update with the outcome.I spoke to her.I told her everything that's been on my mind for months and how she's made me feel about certain things. I made a point that I felt like our friendship was unfair and that my boundaries had been disrespected. I also highlighted her constant negativity and of course, her obsession for this celebrity.I was trying to be kind about things. I told her she needs to get help because she clearly has some issues. She skipped over the celebrity obsession in one paragraph, where she admits she has an unhealthy attachment and says the way she has shared things with me makes it out to be far bigger than it actually is. I strongly disagreed with her on that and she avoided that topic again.Instead she turned the blame of me for not being open and communicating enough and it's my fault my boundaries were not set in place better. That's partly correct, but in my defense, I didn't feel comfortable discussing them because I had a feeling she'd make me guilty for setting them.Maybe I'm just wired different because I assume that if someone goes quiet for a day or two, that generally gives me the idea that they want some space.I don't ask for much from her and I just wanted her to see it from my perspective I guess. I wasn't going to message her but I'm not the kind of person who will block and ghost, stupidly wishing I had taken advice from original post and done exactly that. I'm a dumbass!She has said that she hopes I haven't been offended and hurt by things that **I've** taken the wrong way, not accepting the fact that some of the things she has said genuine were hurtful.She has summed it up like this:*So yeah, I have things to watch out for, but so do you. Try to be better at letting people in so that you can have a chance at making real connections and history doesn't repeat itself.*I asked her to respect my boundaries and not message me again and she has then sent me a document with 2.5k words repeating herself and trying to highlight me as the main problem. And then another two massive paragraphs this morning.Moral of the story, if you have a friend like this, just walk away.&#x200B;TL;DR : UPDATE: I tried to be honest and tell her how I feel and the blame was thrown back at me. Moral of the story, if you have a friend like this, just walk away.","It sounds like you and your friend have been through a lot together and you're really close. It sounds like she's done a lot to hurt your feelings and you don't feel like you can trust her anymore.

"373","My (29f) brother's (26m) anger issues","Lately my brother has been the only nice person in my life. We play videogames online sometimes. He at times gets very angry at the game if things dont go his way or if the game is too difficult. On the other hand he is very nice and empathetic. We talk about a lot of stuff while playing. Today he started getting mad at me. For example when he didnt hear what i said or when i accidentally stood on his way. He said rudely ""can you fucking not stand on my way right now please"". When we were teenagers he beat me up a lot and bullied me, so i went NC. A few years later i contacted him, and he seemed to become nicer. Growing up, our dad had quite of a temper and he often yelled at us. He ""only"" hit me once though, and i dont know if he has hit my brothers.  I think my brother has learned to behave like our dad, even though he often complains about it and how our dad was when we grew up. Now im kind of sad if we go NC again. But im not going to tolerate my brother taking his anger out on me, even verbally. I dont know if i should mention his anger issues to him, and how? tl;dr, my brother snapped at me and i dont know how to move forward. Should i discuss his anger issues with him, and how?","My brother's anger issues stem from a mix of situational and genetic factors. His situational anger issues are largely due to the way he was raised - his parents were frequently argumentative and volatile, and he learned to respond in kind. This made it difficult for him to maintain healthy relationships, as he would often lash out in response to conflict or frustration.His genetic anger issues are aggravated by the fact that he has a very sensitive temperament. He is easily overwhelmed by stress and feels a great deal of anger and frustration much of the time. This can lead to outbursts of anger that are disproportionate to the situation, and can be very destructive."
"374","I [M30]], broke things off with my date [F late 20ish] because she wasn't fully divorced. Could I have handled it differently?","Kind of a weird one, but I do feel shitty about it. To keep it simple, I \[M30\]  met a woman \[F, late 20ish\] on a dating app and we hit it off. We went on a dinner date on the weekday and things went really well, the both of us had some good texts going back and forth throughout the week day and come the weekend the texts turn flirty. We both decided we'd like to meet up for some ""fun"" and met up at a hotel. We get to talking and she mentions she has an ex-husband and talks about coming to the state to follow him for work, but things came apart several months ago and now she's here alone (and she keeps referring to the person as ex-husband). Interesting situation, but nothing too out there for me.&#x200B;Well, come post-""fun"" and we get to talking. She mentions that while they are separated, she and her ex-husband are not legally divorced. Now for me, I have two general rules for dating/ hook-ups: 1. I don't date/hook-up with co-workers and 2. I don't date/hook-up with people in relationships or aren't fully split from their partner. So now post ""fun"" I tell her basically ""sorry, but I don't want to continue seeing you in this capacity since you're not fully/legally split from your ex"". A few more awkward minutes passed and she decided to leave.&#x200B;Now I feel bad about this because 1. I didn't spell out these hang ups explicitly prior to us hooking up, 2. I basically dropped this on her right after the hook-up after I found out and  3. I had a hard time articulating why this was such a hang up for me. In hindsight I should have probably asked if they were fully separated when she mentioned an ex-husband, but the way she talked about it made it seem like it was already done (the tl:dr for that was basically she's in the process of the split, but it's still recent enough to not be finalized/the ex- has a bunch of mental issues that actually preclude him from doing divorce proceedings). As far as I can tell, she was 100% honest that the two of them were done and she had no intention of seeing this person or going back to them, but at the same time, legally they still aren't split and it wasn't clear when that split would be done. I'm trying to figure out how I could have handled this differently so I can be a better person navigating the dating scene going forward.TLDR: Was I an asshole for breaking things off with a hook-up since they're still legally married, but separated?","There's no definitive answer, since all situations are unique. However, if you're worried that your date might misinterpret your decision, you might want to avoid mentioning the fact that you're not fully divorced in your conversation with her. Alternatively, you could choose to simply be honest with her and say that you're not interested in continuing the relationship if she's still married."
"375","My (34M) wife (33F) keeps rolling over me while sleeping and she gets angry if I wake her up","I have to precise something: she doesn't get angry with me. She gets angry about the whole situation.I (34M) have been married with Luna (33F) for around 3 years. She always moved a lot while sleeping but in the last few months it got severely worse. Right now it's not rare for her to go to sleep and roll over me or wake up the next morning having done a completely 180° rotation with her whole body ( she basically wakes up with her feet in the spot where her head was when she went to sleep.).She has problems falling asleep so I generally try not to wake her up but lately I keep waking up in the morning and find her sleeping horizontally over my belly or my chest. I have to get up early for work ( I start working at 6:30 AM, while she start at 8 AM) so I often have to wake her up in order to make her move, which doesn't make her happy.She went to a doctor who told her the main cause for her problem is probably stress, so I tried to let her take easy for a couple of months but it was useless. Next week I have to get up even earlier (5 AM) due to a particular situation in my workplace so I decided to sleep on the couch so that I can get up without waking her up. Does any of you have any solution for the situation? Before someone suggest it:\- we don't have a spare room or another bed. The couch is the closest thing we have to a second bed and it's not exactly comfortable.\- I don't want medical advice. As I said before, we already went to a doctor.TL;DR : my wife basically wrestle with herself while sleeping and roll over me. I have to get to work early so I have to wake her up and she is not happy about it.","There could be a few reasons why your wife rolls over you while sleeping. She could be trying to get closer to you, or she could be feeling overwhelmed.

But I have friends that are friends with her personally and it's where I learnt she has a boyfriend. I think it's just happy crush, since whenever I see her I kinda feel excited (not in a horny way) such as there is this situation where our classrooms are near each other for a certain class schedule and I am always excited for this class because I get to see her across the hall. Is this normal? I am in no way planning to get close with her just so I can try and ruin her relationship with her boyfriend.... I'm just wondering if this is fine or not.TL;DR: I have a happy crush on someone in the same school as I while she has a boyfriend.","Yes, it is generally ok for someone to have a crush on someone who is currently in a relationship.

"377","Suspicious relations M33 F26","My boyfriend (M33) and I (F26) have been dating for eight months now. We met a girl (F22) a couple months in who we got along with right off the bat. We started hanging out at least once a week and really getting to know each other with my boyfriend occasionally tagging along. Suddenly in the last month my friend and my boyfriend have found a common interest that has brought them a lot closer together. Normally, this would not bother me at all, but the last time I that I hung out with my friend, her and my boyfriend completely hijacked to the occasion by talking about this hobby for hours. I am not ignorant about this particular interest, but I definitely do not know as much as they do so I had virtually nothing to add to the conversation, and nobody seemed to notice I was left out. This has happened one more time since then, along with my boyfriend going out of his way twice in the last week to meet up with her while I am at work. There are legitimate tasks related to this hobby that they needed to complete, but I cannot help but feel suspicious. My boyfriend has always treated me like a princess and has given me no reason to believe that he would ever do something to hurt me. My friend also seems like a morally sound, and respectable person that I should have no reason to suspect. But I am jealous. I don’t know if I should say something, and potentially risk both relationships, or if I should just keep my toxic, paranoia nonsense to myself, and wait it out. All I know is that they are likely to be together when I get home from work today, and I am getting increasingly bad at hiding my feelings so I’m worried. Advice?TLDR: my boyfriend and our new friend have struck up a relationship that makes me jealous.","1. Suspicious behavior or reactions:People exhibiting suspicious behavior may be reacting to something that they believe is harmful or dangerous. They may be watching vigilantly for signs of danger, or they may be making suspicious comments or averting their gaze.2. Concealed or hidden motives:People who behave suspiciously might have concealed motives for their actions, such as feeling threatened or angry. They may be covertly collecting information or trying to gather intelligence. Alternatively, they may be trying to undermine or discredit someone else."
"378","Gf(19F) said to me (18m) that we were never actually ""dating.""","Gf(18)F says we're never ""dating"" to me (17)mOk to start this off, I never thought I'd be making a post on here. However, I'm genuinely at a lost in this situation. Earlier today I was texting my supposed gf, we'll just call her gabby: anyways she had said something like ""I'm sorry for being so distant in the past"" for context she had some family issues and I completely understood her taking time to herself. To summarize I responded with ""I understand, don't feel bad for taking time to yourself uk I'm always here for you and perhaps I was pushy when we first started DATING because I didn't take into account your priorities""  this is actually, exactly what I said. To get to the point she essentially said we were not officially dating because I never  specifically asked her to be my Gf. This may have some truth in the literal sense but I have referenced her as my gf several times and she has acknowledge it. The screen saver to my phone is literally a picture of her with the caption heart/gf, and she has seen this before. I asked her about it and she said "" I thought it was cute. I wanted you to actually ask me so I could give you the satisfaction of me saying yes."" Was I not clear enough about the boundaries of our relationship? To wrap this up any outside prospective and advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for this being long wasn't my intention. tl;dr she said we were not dating and now I'm confused.","Gf(19F) told me (18m) that we were never actually ""dating."""
"379","Is my (30f) boyfriend (30m) trying to emotionally abuse me?","Me and my boyfriend have been going through a rough patch recently. He isn’t good at talking about his feelings and he’s quite blunt and isn’t really good at just listening to me without providing advice. He’s even told me I’m too sensitive and he wouldn’t get as upset as I do. I had plans with friends on the weekend but wanted to see him to make things right after a big fight. I asked him if he wanted to still see me and said I would cancel my plans for him and his response was “up to you”. He never once said yes and I’m over the games so I didn’t see him. Yes is a clear answer up to you isn’t. This caused him to become extremely angry at me and say that I made the choice to not see him and he can’t decide or make the choice for me. I said that he never once said yes he would like to see me and now this whole thing has turned into my fault and he’s giving me the silent treatment. He’s also told me that I’m not allowed to spend one on one time with my friends who are male anymore. Every time i express how what he has done has hurt me, he says well you do XYZ, kind of justifying his behaviour. I always just never get an apology. I feel like this is the beginning of him trying to emotional manipulate me and control me. TLDR; my boyfriend is giving me the silent treatment because I didn’t see him after he said “up to you” instead of yes.","This is difficult to say without more information about your relationship. Abuse can take many forms and it is often difficult to determine when one person is abusing another. If you are concerned that your boyfriend may be emotionally abusing you, you may want to talk to him about it. You can also reach out to a mental health professional for assistance."

(note: also, i did suggest renting together back in the fall before i liked them, but that fell thru bc of other stuff. when we considered living together in the spring, they were the first one to bring it up.) do i tell them that i like them or not?i think i've properly really liked skye for a few months by now, but i haven't said anything abt it. i feel like i have been very, very obvious with so many hints, even unintentionally. (several of my friends have even explicitly guessed that i very much have a crush on skye just by the way that i apparently sound so excited & happy when i talk abt them & stuff haha). like it's to the point where apparently most of my friends, just not skye themself. sometimes, i feel like there is no way in hell that skye also likes me, but sometimes i'm just so confused because the line between friendship and flirting is so so thin in queer friendships and it does feel like they're kind of flirting? i'm worried that telling them is going to screw everything up, skye is one of the most amazing people i know, and i don't want to lose their friendship or make living together awkward af.

"381","Why is he (31M) reaching back out after 4 months? (26F)","I (26F) dated this guy (31M)  for about 6 months this past year. Things were never amazing between us, but we both checked so many of each others boxes that we wanted to see of thing could work. After 6 month he broke up with me over a poorly written, three sentence text message; and excused it because of how “insane” his life was at the time. I was generally pretty hurt, and felt disrespected and undervalued that after 6 months I didn’t even deserve a phone call. 4 months later brings me to today where he texts me “(OP) I really miss you. I hope you're doing well. ” Like where is this coming from? Should I respond? I don’t know if it’s because I didn’t flip out on him and things ended with him looking like the ass who dumps people over text and he doesn’t like that, or if he’s coming from a good place. Obviously I shouldn’t respond to give him closure, because he doesn’t deserve my time like that, but frankly when you get dumped over text with very little room for discussion or explanation you don’t get much closure yourself. I kind of wished he never texted, but it also kind of feels like this is the moment I’ve been waiting for when I decided the best revenge I could get was to live my best life possible without him. I kind of want to message to figure out why, but I also don’t want to seem like I’m just still an option to him no matter how disrespectful he is to me. What should I do? TDLR: He dumped me over text after 6 months of dating, and is back 4 months later. How do I respond?","After four months, he might be reaching out because he is feeling lonely and misses being close to you."
"382","Im so morally lost","So me (19m) and my gf (19F) have been together for about 2 years and I’ve been contemplating breaking up with her for a while. I honestly haven’t even fully fleshed out within myself exactly why. Maybe I’m just shallow, maybe I’m super valid, idk yet, but that’s not why I’m making this post. Yesterday she opened up to me about one of the reasons she really likes having me around the house. I can’t say what exactly happened or else this post will be locked, but her grandfather “did some things” with her mother quite long ago. For a very long time. The entire family knows what he’s done and what he is, but despite this he is still allowed to live in the house because he helps with rent. She feels uncomfortable all around the house except her room because of him and having me there helps her fee safe. I still love her and I’m glad i make her feel safe, but I don’t want this relationship anymore. So now I’m faced with a very complicated situation because how could I leave her in a situation like this? He now has dementia and is probably on his way out but still what am I to do? Just stay with her until he dies or goes senile? Any advice is welcome, just trying to navigate through my moralitytl;dr: would it be wrong for me to end the relationship despite the crucial role I have in her life?","I've lost my compassI don't know where I standI'm so confusedI don't know what to doBut I still try to be kindAnd I still try to be fairBut sometimes I feel like a fraudAnd I can't help but feelthat I'm so morally lost"

"384","25 M 25 F","Let's start from the beginning, about 2 and a half years ago I (25) m and H (25) f met. The year before she lost her infant son in a terrible accident, so we took things very slow as I didn't wanna push her. So for about a year I was there for her and her 3 daughters emotionally and some times financially. In that year and a half her home was destroyed by a Tornado so she had to find somewhere new to rent, the only place she could find was double what she was paying before, but I told her I'd help and we'd make things work. It was around the time she moved into the new house she started talking to her ex which is her son that passed dad. Sneaking behind my back to talk to him and even went to a bonfire with him and some other people. Also talking to her ex's mom, that hates me and only tries to get them back together. Well I told her them or me so she stopped talking to them. So after the year and a half we officially get together and after a few months I decided to buy a mobile home for me, her and her 3 daughters, (its nice I spent almost $15,000)  and we would only pay lot rent, way cheaper. Everything is great. Cut to this year in January, right around his anniversary of passing she falls right back into her old habits she's talking to both of them again she's lying to me, trying to hide things from me (she's not very good at either), and I even got a picture where she went out to eat with her ex and his mom. And she's still talking to them now and because of it the relationship is falling apart. I feel like she doesn't respect me because Ive told her im not comfortable with her being around them, but she does it anyway. She says she has flashbacks and that sometimes she forgets that he's even gone and she's back into the time when the two of them were together. But no matter what I do I can't get her to open up to me and talk to me anymore... Its like she doesn't even care.. please help me...Tl;Dr: I found out my girlfriend is going behind my back and lying to me but she just lost her son before we got together idk what to do.","25 M 25 F is the median age of women in the United States.

Only problem is we see each other maybe once a week. She got a raise and works from 4pm to 130-330am everyday except Friday. I work from 6am to 330pm everyday except Friday. Since I control my schedule, I chose Friday off so we can have time for one another.Only issue is that on that day she always has certain obligations that take up most of the day. We're lucky to get more than 5 hours together. It comes to a point that an attractive coworker who shows interest in me while giving me attention I don't receive at home and it feels good. I know it's bad, I don't pursue any of it. We talk about this and she always just tells me to give her time things will work out but it's been this way for 2 Years. I know her, she doesn't have a plan she's just hoping it works out🤦🏾‍♂️I'm stuck between considering just saving us the time and ending things before we spiral.

At first it started as both of us just exchanging homework answers with each other, but we quickly ended up becoming good friends as it turns out we have a good deal in common. A few weeks ago, I mustered up the courage to ask her out to coffee, and to my surprise she enthusiastically accepted. We haven't found a time to go out because of scheduling conflicts, her getting sick and finals week, but it's clear we both want to do this. Although we agreed not to approach it as a date, I can't help but wonder if there's the potential for something more because of the chemistry we have together. Even though we have a good deal of chemistry, there's quite a few obstacles that make me think this might be a fruitless endeavor:\- Cultural difference: I'm Indian (born and raised in the US) and she's white. We're also from different parts of the US.\- Looks: I'm not ugly by any stretch (I'd give myself a 6-6.5/10) but she's a little out of my league (9/10 or so).\- She's part of a popular sorority on campus and I'm an independent who only parties sporadically. I've heard this alone may be a dealbreaker.For now, I'm more than fine with just being friends with her, but I just want some advice for in case things start to escalate.TL;DR - I asked out one of my friends and she said yes. Even though we've agreed to remain friends for now, I can't help but wonder if there's potential for something more; however, several surface-level obstacles make me wonder if it's even worth pursuing.","There are a few things you can do in this situation:1. Talk to your friend about why you have a crush on them. This will help them understand your feelings and might even lead to a conversation about whether or not they reciprocate your feelings.2. Keep your crush a secret from your friend. If they know about your crush and you don't feel comfortable discussing it with them, you can try to keep it a secret from them. This can be difficult, but it can help you to maintain some privacy.3. Talk to your crush about your feelings. If you're comfortable doing so, you can talk to your crush about your feelings. This can help you to both process your feelings and potentially develop a relationship with them."

My FWB and I are very sexual together and I think in that aspect we are compatible. But I know in a relationship we don’t have the same goals. However when I tell him my goals and ask him his, he starts saying we could have a baby together or travel together and things about when our relationship is able to progress.FWB tells me he is taking care of his very elderly grandmother (102) and he likes me and dreams about me and we can do sexual things together but not be in a serious relationship because of her.

I told him no, I just need no contact.When the 30 day NC is over, I think I need to stop being friends with him completely so I can move on.

"388","How do I (31F) maintain friendships (30s F) while struggling with mental illness?"," I was let go from my job on Wednesday. While I wasn't exactly thrilled with the job, the idea of not having a source of income and the uncertainty of finding a new job is weighing heavily on me. Unfortunately, my previous struggles with social anxiety and depression have made it difficult for me to make friends. However, I texted two good friends on Wednesday (both 32F) to let them know what happened.  Although my friends have responded with supportive messages, I haven't had the emotional energy to read or respond to them yet. It's hard for me to find the right words and not worry about how I'll come across. I keep thinking that I'll tackle the task later when I'm feeling better. I feel guilty for not responding to my friends, but I know that my mental health struggles sometimes make it hard for me to be a good friend. I plan to reach out to them today, apologize for not getting back to them sooner, and explain that I might need a little more time to process everything. The mere thought of this conversation is causing me anxiety. I worry they might be upset with me for not responding earlier. It's hard to put into words how I'm feeling right now. I've never had friends I felt comfortable opening up to without fearing judgment. It's like a constant battle in my head, worrying that I'm a bad friend and will never find true connections. Although I'm in counseling, there are days when I wonder if it's enough. It might sound like I'm venting, but I'm just trying to sort out my thoughts. Have any of you been in a similar situation? Have you been able to maintain friendships despite struggling with mental illness? I would really appreciate any advice or encouragement you could offer. Thank you.**TL;DR:** Recently let go from my job, and struggling to cope with the idea of unemployment while also battling social anxiety and depression that make it hard to maintain friendships. Texted two good friends to let them know what happened, but haven't been able to read their messages yet. Planning to reach out soon, but worried about their response. Looking for advice and support from others who have been through similar experiences.","One approach is to create a support group where people with mental illness can talk openly and share experiences.

"389","I (21F) Have a Lack of Friends and It’s Harming My Relationship With My Fiancé (23M)","For some context, when I was younger I went through an extremely rough break up from a long term abusive relationship. I decided to move states, into a small town that I would be able to have a fresh start with the support of my grandparents. I at one point downloaded Tinder just in attempts for friendships, since I didn’t have a job yet and lived in a town where everyone already knew each other. Of course nothing came out of it, except my fiancé who I have now been together with for three years. Since then I’ve been focused on building a career and finding out what I wanted to do in life, and moving out on my own (with my fiancé). Both things I have a succeeded in.I currently have a best friend and another friend who are on and off together but great people and always get along regardless of their status. But lately they’ve been extremely unresponsive to me and it’s made me lonely. She is currently a full time student, full time worker and dealing with a stalker so I am understanding and not resentful. I have had other friends but they either moved away or we drifted from personality conflict. Due to this I have been relying heavily on my fiancé for all of my social interaction. He’s been very sweet about it but I can tell it’s been exhausting. I feel like I need all of his attention, of course he still plays his games but always makes a lot of time for me too. But only seemingly having him has given me an anxious attachment style, I can’t even go to the grocery store unless he will go with me. I reach out to my friend but I get no response, and I have no idea how to make more friends or discover hobbies. Every hobby I try I burn out of so fast. I feel stuck. I don’t want to suffocate him and I want to be my own person but it feels so hard. How do you I even begin? TL;DR: I moved states years ago and focused on career building and moving out. Now I have no friendships or passionate hobbies and I rely too heavily on my fiancé. Who seems fine with it, but I know it’s not healthy for either of us. How do I learn to be my own person and gain a social outlet again?","There are a few things that could be causing your lack of friends. It's possible that you're not spending enough time socializing with friends, or that you're not engaging in activities that you enjoy with friends. If you and your fiancé are trying to build a strong relationship, it's important for you to spend time together and engage in activities that you both enjoy. If you don't have friends to share your interests with, your fiancé may feel left out."
"390","Am I actively lying when I tell my bf ""I'm fine""?","I (30f) have been dating my bf (35m) for 8 years now. I'm going to be pretty honest here, it is quite a toxic relationship, we are talking over an issue multiple times per week, and neither of us have the best communication skills. Yes we are both in therapy. Nothing is physical or abusive, and I don't think either of us is intentionally manipulating the other. But we are best friends and the love and good times still prevail. My barrier to effective communication is often that I don't know exactly how I'm feeling immediately. Like, last night, we had a small tiff and he asked me why my face was weird was something wrong? And I told him that I wasn't trying to make a face and no nothing's wrong. About 20 minutes later, I told him that I was upset and why. One of his reactions was that it is not okay for me to lie to him, I told him that I just didn't have words yet and wasn't ready, he said that is not an effective way to communicate and I need to figure out words to tell him quicker so he is not feeling like everything I say is disingenuous.I do see where he's coming from, and I am a little jealous of his ability to almost immediately pinpoint where something has hurt him. But I also feel like talking about my feelings is on my own time...when I'm ready, I'll talk. I am not giving him the cold shoulder or anything, and I do understand that ""I'm fine"" is technically a lie. But there have been a few times where I finally have words 3 days after something, and I just don't tell him because he will say that discredits a lot of what was said during those 3 days.Tldr; Is it okay that my bf gets upset when I take too long to formulate words for my feelings, and when I say ""I'm fine"" to buy time?","Yes, you are lying when you say that you are fine."
"391","How can I (f22) help my bf (m22) be less stressed?","This might be a little long, sorry. So basically, since I’ve become pregnant I haven’t been able to help my bf run out construction business because I’m just constantly nauseous and exhausted all of the time (this is my first pregnancy). I know having me on helped him out both physically and emotionally, I would be able to help with decisions and lessen the workload on him as well. Since I can no longer work, only making contracts and such from home, I’ve noticed he has been kind of leaving me in the dark. I can tell he is stressed out no matter how much he tells me I shouldn’t worry about anything. He keeps leaving me in the dark as to “not stress out the baby” and such since this is a fragile time in my pregnancy.. I want to be able to no worry but I can see the toll it’s taking on him mentally. He keeps telling me he’s fine and happy but I feel like he’s just saying that to spare my feelings.We have also been looking to buy a house ASAP and I help with that heavily but I am afraid it’s just adding more to his plate.He’s been spending a lot of time in the gym, literally daily and sometimes for 6hrs+. I know the gym is where he likes to decompress but it’s the frequency that’s a dead giveaway to his mental state. He’s very stressed out but he won’t let me in on what’s wrong. Every time I ask him he gets annoyed and tells me to just let him handle things. When his mom asks too he gets so upset, he literally told her to butt out of his business the other day right in front of me. It was so out of character for him. I just want to know how I could maybe lessen the stress on him without making it feel like I’m stepping on his toes or nagging or anything like that. I still do the housework, one thing I haven’t been able to do is cook (food aversion) but I’m sure once this first trimester passes I’ll be able to do that again. I know he really misses my cooking. Honestly, I just hate seeing him so overworked. I need to help somehow. It’s eating away at me seeing him this way. TLDR: My bf is really stressed out and I need advice on how I can help to relive some stress while being pregnant and fragile.","There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best way to help your bf (m22) be less stressed may vary depending on the particular situation. However, some options you may consider include trying to understand what stresses him out and providing him with support and advice when he feels stressed. You could also try to help him relax and decompress after he feels stressed, by taking him for a walk, for example, or indulging in a hobby or activity that relaxes him. Finally, you could try to support him when he makes decisions that may stress him out, by providing him with positive affirmation and advice."
"392","My bf lied to me about something small and now I’m questioning everything.","Me (26f) and my bf (28m) have been together almost 2 years. For a long time I always thought he was being honest with me, because he is a pretty blunt guy. A lot of what he has told me has been backed up by stories from other people. I do notice he embellishes stories sometimes, but when I pay attention to other people I notice they do too. I think it’s a natural human thing to a certain degree.The other day, we had a storage container in our yard that a couple things were stolen from. I was upset. I remember he was in there the night prior, and I saw the lock in the garage. I asked him after we noticed things were missing if he had locked it that night, and he said yes. But how would have anyone gotten in? Also, I saw the lock in the garage. So I told him I didn’t think he did, and he admitted he didn’t. I said he told me he locked it so when I report the stolen info in the claim it sounds more concrete.I’m just so bothered he lied. Why not be open about it. I told him how much that bothered me and he initially went on to ask if I had ever told him a lie? Like he is saying it’s okay if it’s harmless at times.Have I ever lied to me bf? I’ve told him I’ve worked out at home on a day I didn’t, because I was feeling lazy. That’s it. So I don’t know.Anyways, I’m wondering how big of a red flag this is. He eventually apologized and said he should’ve been just honest from the start. Thoughts? TDLR: my bf lied to me about something small and I feel uncomfortable about it","It sounds like you're upset about something that happened between your bf and you. It's important to talk about what's bothering you so you can figure out what to do next. It sounds like you might be questioning your relationship with your bf, and that's definitely something you should think about. Talk to him about what's happening and see if he can give you some clarification. If he can't or doesn't want to talk about it, you might want to consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help you work through your feelings."

We exchange numbers and arrange to hang out sometime during the week or next week and he offered to cook me a nice dinner. He seemed so excited and happy we were talking again. A few hours later I get a text saying “hey I’m sorry but I’m actually still seeing my girlfriend, I only see her about once per week and then we do nothing. I just really miss you and needed to talk to you. I’m sorry if I got your hopes up and I hope I haven’t upset you, I really do miss you though” I responded with “ok, thank you for letting me know” and he said “I appreciate you talking to me and being so nice and listening to me, I haven’t had that in along time, again I’m sorry” and we just left it at that. My question is, why? Why would he message me, make plans with me just to tell me a few he’s later he’s still “sorta” with his girlfriend that he only see’s “once a week”.**TL;DR ex messaged me telling me he loves, misses me, still thinks about me.. we make plans to hang out then a few hours later he tells me he can’t keep talking to me because he has a girlfriend he see’s once a week?**","This is definitely a red flag. If your ex boyfriend 27m messaged you 26f telling you he loves you and misses you then a few hours later tells you he can’t talk or see you because he still see’s his girlfriend, it means that he is still in a relationship with his previous girlfriend, and he is not interested in moving forward with you. This is likely because he is still emotionally attached to his previous girlfriend and is not ready to break up with her yet. If this is the case, it is important that you respect his decision and do not contact him anymore."
"394","I need my jealousy in check between me 29m and my gf 23f","Guys I'm 29[m] need help with a jealousy problem regarding gf 23 [f]So if you have any problems with the qge difference then skip ahead. So now for some background we have been in a ldr relationship for the past 3+ years and we had a ton of problems. Basically me fuckinf up qnd getting blind drunk while I didn't cheat or even met anyone or did anything questionable this is pretty fuckes up behaviour I'll admit. And I'm pretty sure most of you will just say she should dump me end of story. I don't blame you I blame myself for being a stupid idiot I said many things while drunk that I regret hurtful things. So she kind of had enough of my shit, understandable, but she's agreed to us talking and giving her shot of me earning back the trust she originally had. Now here's my problem I've always a ys been jealous because I've gotten fucked so many times I can't count so now I'm cautious overly so which has always been q problem in our relationship and which I'm trying hard to change. Which brings me to tonight. Now I'm from a pretty liberal country where everything goes and it's why I'm more paranoid she's from a much more traditional country where everything goes down behind closed doors. Tonight she told me she's going to a party qt q friends house which is q safe place from prying eyes and she will be spending the night and getting drunk but I have no reason to be worried be ause she'll be in company of just girls and a guy she claims is gay. I'm fighting between my overly jealous nature qnd make q scene qnd keep my promise of staying cool qnd trusting her. My question is how can I make myself calmer, besides getting hammered, and should I be trusting or is this a ruse so she gets me off her back. Remeber were literally thousands of miles away and the only thing that held us together so long was mutual trust which as far as I know I was the only one who broke it and neither of us cheated thats obviously just what I can know from her words. I should mention I do love her with all my heart and before I was a dick so did she now she isn't so sure so that's why I'm so worriedTl;Dr what do I do to be less jealous and be better in general and is it worth it.English isn't my first language so I'm sorry for all the mistakes.","There's no need to be jealous if you are in a monogamous relationship. Your girlfriend is your partner and should be treated as such. If you are feeling jealous, you may want to take steps to address that."
"395","My boyfriend’s (26M) music is driving me insane (26F)","He is trying to become a music producer so he has been spending loads of money on new speakers and equipment. He makes the music on a computer software and it’s soo loud and always on a loop for hours. he doesn’t want to wear headphones because he says it’s not the same as listening to the sounds without it. He has been doing this music thing for about 3 years (been together for 5).. While I’ve been supportive of his music, it’s getting annoying now. I’ll be in the room next to him trying to study and his music is just in a loop blasting I’m talking like 8 hours or more a day. Right when he gets home he goes straight to music making. And he has a job where he can come home early so it’s not fun lol because I know exactly what I’ll be hearing until the day ends. I’m pretty sure our neighbors can hear his music every day as well.When he isn’t playing his music, he’s playing video games on the PC without headphones. Loud as fuck. When we lay down together or watch tv together he’s on TikTok with the volume up..  even when it’s time to sleep it’s just TikTok or YouTube loud as hell. I’m neurodivergent. I’ve tried to be supportive and not be a naggy girlfriend, but it’s getting really old now. As I’m typing this it’s the weekend and so obviously he gets to start his music early and as I’m typing the music is indeed on while I’m trying to stud bro I can’t. I’m not a hater. I support his music and even gave him some ideas for his productions but like I said his music is always in a loop I’m going crazy. Closing the door doesn’t help. Tl;dr boyfriend of 5 years wants to become a music producer. Plays his loud music on loop for hours a day. Can’t get a break of loudness. If it’s not his music it’s him watching TikTok or YouTube right next to me volume high. He doesn’t ever want to wear headphones. Closing the door does nothing pretty sure neighbors can hear his music. It’s effecting me while I study and because I’m neurodivergent.","Your boyfriend's music is driving you insane because it's making you stressed out and unhappy. It's time to talk to him about how much it's impacting your life. He may not be aware of how much it's affecting you, and he may need to adjust the music volume or find other ways to calm you down."
"396","I(F17) am getting annoyed by my boyfriend(M17) and Idk what to do","This is a throway account cause he has reddit but as the titles states, I am getting annoyed by him. Weve been together almost a year. We havent been able to hang out a lot bc of how busy we are. Idk if I'm feeling this way bc I'm pms'ing(I should probably tell him this), or if I'm stressed but I genuinely don't like his jokes sometimes. I'll comment something he'll have to say ""And I'll say wow that's crazy, or oh that's annoying. Then hell respond with ""Well I think you're crazy"" or ""Well I think you're annoying"". At first it was funny, he'd say the crazy one, but now he's starting to say the annoying one.  His sense of humor is sarcasm. I dont like to be called annoying? Am I being too sensitive about this?Also I don't know why this bothers me, but I'll ask him a question and sometimes he'll be like pff idk. I understand you don't know cause I'm like that too, but sometimes I want an answer. I'm curious about something and it feels like I can't connect with him. I'm I asking too much? I know the best answer would be to communicate this with him, but I don't know how to with it feeling like I'm changing his personality.Then most recently he texted if we wanted to go somewhere on the weekend. I'm like "" actually maybe"" cause again we're both busy with stuff and I was genuinely excited. I forgot I was grounded too so I said ""um actually I can't I'm still grounded"". He said he was joking, he just wanted to see if I was still grounded. I said well "" you could have asked if I was grounded or not"" , but he said ""he was killing 2 birds with one stone"". In smidge way did that seem like that. I probably should have said not to do that and just ask straight up, but I didn't. This is all starting to annoy me, along with stress from school, work, and sports. It somewhat made me think i wanted to break up with him, or just take a break. What should I do??TL:DR I'm getting annoyed by my boyfriend saying ""well I think..."" and then any adjective as a comment to what he is talking about. I dont know if I'm taking this to heart too much, but I need advice on what to say.","There are a few things you could do in order to deal with the situation. First, it might be helpful to talk to your boyfriend about why he's bothering you. He may not realize that his actions are bothering you and could work to change his behavior. Additionally, you could try to get support from family or friends in order to help you deal with the situation. Finally, you could consider ending the relationship for your own sake."
"397","(Advice wanted) Husband does not typically respond to me falling/tripping/hurting myself","Is this normal? I(28F) can not find any information on via typical search engines but it strikes me as odd.My husband(29M) does not typically respond to me falling, tripping, or getting minor injuries like hitting my funny bone, shin, stubbing my toe etc. The catalyst for writing this is that my husband and I are working on a home project and in the process of me taping off the window trim, one of the stool legs slipped through the vent in the floor and I ended up falling towards the ground and scraping the bottom part of my leg. In my peripheral, I could see me husband look up when he heard me cry out but then go straight back to doing what he was doing without saying anything. It seems so minor that I wonder if I’m overreacting but when I think about it, he so very rarely responds to this sort of thing.Is this behavior typical? In my house growing up my parents didn’t act this way and my siblings and I didn’t and don’t act this way. I feel like his lack of a response is odd but when I brought up my concerns he brushes them off. TL;DR: husband does not have a reaction to me falling/tripping/minor injuries.","First, it may be helpful to see if there is a pattern to his non-response and if there is, talk to him about it. If there is not a pattern, it may be helpful to specifically ask him to help you when you fall or trip, as this may help him feel more connected to you and become more attentive in the event that something like this does happen. Additionally, it may be helpful to remind him that you are just as human as he is and that you need assistance from time to time."
"398","My BF won’t post me on social media but posts other girls","Tl;dr Bf(M19) me(F18) (we’re going on 3 years btw) My bf doesn’t post me on any social media but posts other girls. Is that weird? To pre-warn the girls I am referring to he knows irl, follows on social media, and I would consider them more acquaintances than good friends. But I also don’t know any of them that well. He also never hangs out with them regularly or alone. My bf posts his girl friends on social media but he will not post me. These posts he makes are not flirty or suggestive either. I have brought this topic up to him saying how it makes me uncomfortable but his response was that he just doesn’t like any pictures of us together. Even tho I have told him it makes me jealous he continues to do it. He also said he doesn’t post anything important on social media either. Implying I’m too important to post ig? And I get wanting to keep a relationship off the internet and keep it private I don’t mind that at all actually. I just feel weird seeing that my bf has reposted other girls’ accomplishments or birthdays but he has never done that for me. Any person looking at his social media would not be able to tell I was his gf. Also I don’t post him either but I am not active on social media like he is. Am I overthinking this?","There could be a few reasons why your partner won't post you on social media. It could be because they don't want to share too many pictures with just one person, or they might not feel comfortable posting pictures of you without your consent. It's possible that they just prefer to see the posts from other people in their social media feed. If this is the case, try asking them why they prefer to post with other people and see if you can convince them to start posting more filtered pictures of you together."
"399","My (17F) boyfriend (17M) broke up with me two weeks ago and I've been getting heart palpitations","About two weeks ago, my boyfriend of almost a year took me aside and explained he didn't care for me anymore, hadn't been happy for a month, and wanted a break. The decision was done. This was through Valentine's Day, his birthday, family dinners, etc. Four days later he posted a video online of him holding someone else's hand.It was a shock, but honestly I'm doing alright emotionally. He was a piece of crap apparently, and I have other people who care about me and support me. I've even gone on a couple new dates. However, the most concerning thing is that I've been getting heart palpitations. My heart will get up to 100bpm or greater for as long as a few minutes while I'm just sitting in class. I can generally feel my heart beating and my chest throbbing when it happens. Most of the time it happens when I'm thinking about him, but sometimes it's just random. It can happen as many as 9 times a day and sometimes it doesn't happen at all. I'm very active, I exercise around four days a week and I'm a pretty healthy person. This is very irregular for me. I told myself if it was still happening after a week I would tell someone but it's been two weeks and I still haven't said anything. What should I do?tl;dr I've been getting heart palpitations for the past two weeks, what should I do?"," and really anxious since then. He told me he didn't want to be with me anymore because I'm not ""romantic"" enough for him. I don't know what to do to make myself feel better."
"400","He really hurt me but I miss him","A few weeks ago, I (18f) told my very close friend of 2 years (18m) I was done with our friendship, and I wouldn’t be talking to him anymore. Long story short, he treated me horribly. He would manipulate me, gaslight me and constantly put all the blame on me whenever he did something and I called him out on it. He used to be my best friend, and he used to be such a nice person but changed into a completely different person, practically unrecognizable. About a month and a half ago I said the same thing and after two weeks he texted me and said he missed me and he’s had a crush on me and can see himself being with me in the future, and promised not to hurt me or be awful to me anymore. Just a few days later he was back to being horrible to me, and I couldn’t take it anymore and said I’m done. I go back and forth from hating him and never wanting to see/talk to him again, and missing him so much and feeling like I have to text him. I have a habit of falling back into old toxic habits, because it’s almost comforting to me how familiar it is. I’m not sure what to do, because one part of me hates him and the other wants so badly to text him and tell him I’m sorry and I miss him. I know i shouldn’t but I can’t stop thinking about everything. I’ve been skipping school because I’m terrified to see him, and I’m going back soon and have to face him. Also, I know i shouldn’t be letting someone affect me this much, and I wish I could stop. I would really appreciate some advice. TL;DR told a close friend i was tired of the way he treated me and broke it off, but I still miss him.","If someone really emotionally hurt you, you may miss them. You may feel like you can't get over the feeling of hurt and may feel like you're stuck in a cycle of pain. You may also feel like you're alone in your pain."
"401","I (21M) feel like I am no longer a priority for my girlfriend (21F)","I will try to make this short and simple..Met my girlfriend, and for 1 ½ years we were good, in my opinion because it's was something new , and we didn't want to annoy anyone.But , these last few months I got a job that is 400km from where we live, and can come home 4 days every 2 weeks.My issue is that I feel like my GF never has time for me, and plans a night out every day of the weekend with her friends and doesn't invite me.She says I "" wouldn't like being there"" so she doesn't ever bother inviting me. I would probably say no, but an invitation would be appreciated since every time I go out , I invite her, knowing she is going to say no.She likes being with me and with her friends, so she tries to get the best of both worlds.. both of us at the same time.2 days ago I told her I wanted to have a date, just the two of us, and without asking for ""permission"" invited her friend to make us company. Something I told her I was against because I wanted just some time alone with her.And.. the biggest problem for me is the way she does everything for her friends buys them gifts and pays them drinks, but doesn't do the same thing for me , and undervalues my health problems (asthma) and let's her friends some in the car, making me exit the car so that they can smoke with no issue whatsoever, telling me afterwards that I was exaggerating.I really love her but I am getting tired of feeling treated like this, and making like everything is my fault.I need your opinion on this one! Thanks very muchTL;DR : GF makes me everything my own fault, and I don't feel prioritized","If you feel like you are no longer a priority in your girlfriend's life, it may be time to reassess your relationship. If your girlfriend is constantly busy with other responsibilities or activities, it may be that she does not have the time or energy to devote to your relationship. If this is the case, it may be best to consider ending the relationship."
"402","A guy (26M) that came to see me (24F) a couple weeks ago hasn't replied to my texts in a week and I wonder if it's because I said anything wrong","We are both in our mid-20's. We've only met twice but the 2nd time, he had to travel 4 hours (and take a plane ride back to our home state after) to see me because I moved after our first date 3 months ago (he stayed at my place with me for that weekend so it wasn't a traditional '2nd date'). It took us 2-3 months to meet again after our first date because I had moved and he went on a long travel, so we were texting here and there during that time. He's a pretty bad texter, like he can take 2-3 days on average to reply back, and he also is quite bland and boring over text (he's those people you just have to meet in person). One time, he even took like 10 days to reply to me, but he's fine with texting when he needs to make plans and such. During the weekend he came, honestly I had a lot of fun and he drove us everywhere and paid for a lot of our outings too. I found that to be really sweet (I took my turn on some of them as well!). When he got back to our home state a couple weeks ago, he seemed fine with the bit of texting we did. Last week, I sent him a message on how I made new friends (I posted a pic with them on my social media too). He replied back with ""Yeah I saw your post. I felt so happy you made friends"". All this sounded normal to me, so I continued and sent him this whole ass story about how they were and how it went, and that I drank a lot with them and when I got back home, I would have probably passed out if someone was with me but because I was alone, I had to take care of myself. And then I went on about how hard it was to take care of myself and that I couldn't get myself out of the shower and it took me 30 minutes to get my contacts out and I somehow crawled into bed after, which was kinda funny now that I'm looking back at it. He drinks a lot himself and enjoys it. He has seen me drunk before and even helped me throw up once. I didn't give him any gross details (they weren't any) but I wonder if I came off too immature or something. Thoughts?tl;dr: Wanted 2nd opinions on if I said anything wrong to this guy that I've met and had a really good time with otherwise.","It's possible that he was busy and didn't have time to reply to your texts. Alternatively, it's possible that he didn't want to reply because he wasn't interested in you. Either way, it's always nice to have someone to talk to, so if you feel like he's been ignoring you, just give him a call or text and see if he's available to chat."

"404","My [F27] boyfriend [M26] says I'm boring","Me and my boyfriend have been together for about 3.5 years. We both love each other very much but I'm more quiet and he's more of a talker, which has proven to be a big issue in our relationship. He complains that when we have conversations, it feels like it's nothing/boring. He's usually the one to initiate conversations by talking about his hobbies and work. I respond in a way that seems ""small talky"" and he feels like I'm not really interested. I truly am interested to know things about his day or what he likes and I ask questions about what he's talking about. But it's hard for me to relate since we have quite different interests. If I bring up something I like, like cooking, he gets irritated because he says that's all I talk about besides work, and that I don't have any hobbies besides that. He says because we have boring conversations, it's hard for him to feel intimate and it's like we're roommates, not in a relationship. In the past he brought up that he wishes I initiated conversations more, and I've tried improving by asking how his day was when he gets home and asking about his hobbies. It's just not enough and I was wondering if anyone else is going/has gone through this? What did you do to fix it?Tldr: me and boyfriend don't have great conversations and he finds me boring because of it, and I need help to fix it.","This can be interpreted in a few ways. Firstly, he may just not find you interesting. Secondly, he may think you don't have many interesting things to say. Thirdly, he may think you're not spontaneous or adventurous."

I have a niche job so it was really cool that he knew some of the words I was saying lol. We got along well at dinner and after we went to his house and played trivia/watched a movie.I didn’t realize he could be related to anyone I’ve ever met until I saw his side profile, and it’s like an exact match for a guy I hooked up with a few times back in ~2016. I believe they are brothers. It was a handful of times, partly because he worked days and I worked nights and his personality was off putting.I feel guilty and need to tell him this to make sure that he is 100% aware and won’t feel blindsided. I also feel bad since I didn’t cuddle with him much or kiss him, as I didn’t want him to do anything he would not have had he known what I figured out, even though he otherwise was doing very well lol.How do I tell him? Is there specific wording that would help? I’ve never been in this situation before.TLDR I went on a date with a man I’m 99% sure is the brother of a man I hooked up with years ago. How do I tell him?",".This can definitely create some awkwardness, as you may not be familiar with each other's histories.

She shows me 0 initiative and interest in sex since the  beginning of our relationship. Yes, I have talked about it with her  multiple times to show initiative and asked if there's anything wrong  about my body or size and that was not the point. She just can't get in  the mood and has a low libido. She also admitted she sees a relationship  more as a emotional connection (which we have) but only that. We do  have sex from time to time but it's below average. My libido is sky  rocketing since I work out 5 days a week. Lately I've been experiencing a  lot of lust and been looking at other women. I feel bad about this but  can't help myself. I don't and won't ever cheat on her since I love her  very much.

My boyfriend didn’t find this out until 2 days ago when a mutual friend told him what happened. He didn’t want me to tell her initially but then agreed that it was the better thing to do (for context, he is fairly good friends with M and her boyfriend D, but agrees that for various reasons that D is actually not a very good person especially when drinking). He has said is is prepared to lose D as a friend and also for the person who told him this information to be a bit annoyed with him.What I’m not sure about is whether or not me and my boyfriend should tell M together?I thought it might be good if we tell her together so she could see that my boyfriend has her back as well as I do, but I’m not sure.Any ideas?Tldr: should I tell my friend her boyfriend has cheated on her by myself, or should I tell her with the person who told me the information (my boyfriend?)","First and foremost, be honest with your friend. Tell her that you know about the affair and that you're both disappointed. It's important that your friend knows that you're there for her and will support her through this difficult time.

"409","Dealing with emotional immaturity in a spouse","Obligatory throw away because people know my main and apologies for the long post. I (35F) am at my wits end with my husband of 3 years (34M). He’s great ALMOST all of the time, right up until I air a grievance with him. He name calls, invalidates, gas lights, etc. I feel like I’m living with two different people at this point. I will be the first to admit I’m very vocal about things that upset me or hurt my feelings big or small because I think it’s unfair to him (or anyone) if I’m upset or bothered but hold it in and build up resentment for him continuing to do things he doesn’t even know are bothering me. When I address these issues with him he’s immediately defensive and blows up. He laughs at me, tells me I’m being ridiculous, says it “must be time for my period”, calls me a psychopath, says I sound like a whiney child, the list goes on. It’s like he just snaps and starts screaming and spewing vile. The best way I can surmise it is that it feels like and resembles a grown man temper tantrum. Nothing is actually resolved between us anymore because I stop the now argument and walk away rather than being disrespected and continuing to engage or feeding into the escalation. I do my best to approach the issue or readdress one again when we’re both calm and relaxed and I am very careful to use “I” statements and a calm tone in response to his tirade but it doesn’t change his reaction. I feel like I’ve tried all of the things I know to do to communicate in a healthy way. This happens maybe two times a month at most so it’s far from an everyday thing. That being said, these reactions are somewhat new behavior for him, starting within the last year or so but seem to be the default now. Is there anything I can do differently to change this? Is having my feelings hurt two times a month too much and I’m just too sensitive? Should I save communicating my hurt feelings for “big” or recurring issues? I legitimately hate fighting and arguing and feel like his reactions are more upsetting than the issue that sparked the reaction. TLDR: Husband gets defensive and lashes out when I tell him situations that hurt my feelings and idk how to fix it.","It can be difficult to deal with emotional immaturity in a spouse. One approach is to try to understand what is driving the immaturity. Often, emotional immaturity is the result of chronic stress or unresolved issues from the past. If you can identify the sources of stress in your relationship and work on resolving them, you may be able to help your spouse grow and learn more mature behaviors. You may also want to consider seeking counseling or therapy to help you cope with the immaturity."
"410","It has been a year and I [29F] am still bitter towards my partner [32M] of 3.5 years for losing my cat.","My partner and I had been together for two and a half years at the time.I have a beautiful Siamese cat. She was my baby and had a lot of social issues and anxiety. She really needed her space. She was never aggressive, just did not want you in her space.I told him several times to stop locking her in the bedroom to feed her, because he was annoyed she would not eat with the other cats (they got along, again she just liked her space).She ended up breaking the latch on our windows (they're from the 40s) and snuck out.I know it was not on purpose or with malicious intent .  But it was careless. I nearly lost my job from missing work looking for her. We spent thousands on bloodhounds, trail cams, cages... Posters everywhere, online, big ones at intersections, door to door... It's been a year and a half and no sign of her at all. We also love in coyote country...I'm so heartbroken over her loss. I still look for her and post her photo where I can with my information. He just... Doesn't seem to care...We have a really healthy relationship otherwise but this has hurt me so deeply. I question leaving him often because I feel so resentful. I have approached couples counseling and he has said no, he is too busy with school. But if I leave then the cats we have adopted together would suffer because they love him .TL;DR - I'm just really hurting and would love advice. I don't want to resent him but it's hard not to. I just wish I could find my baby girl. 😢","It's been a year and I'm still bitter towards my partner of 3.5 years for losing my cat.

"411","It was all true","So I (32m) met this girl (27f) at a comedy club where we worked . We almost immediately had chemistry and talked about our past which we then unfortunately formed a love bond. I had lived in San Antonio Texas my whole life and she had just moved here from Idaho .  Well she seemed sane and down to earth but there were huge flags. Before we had even gotten together we had talked about relationship dynamics and I expressed how I have a high sex drive and very affectionate. She claimed she was as well   Well When we first got together,for the first month , she had gotten sick unfortunately, so I did the boyfriend thing and tended to her . Shortly after things got weird . She would barley text me, and at times I wouldn’t hear from her for 12,13,14 hours . When I finally would get ahold of her, she claimed she was asleep.  And this was a reoccurring theme. I would then notice bruises on her thighs and when I asked her about them she claims she bruises easy and doesn’t recall how she got them. Ok fair enough. Well one day I was cleaning our cars and I found a bag she had used to do laundry a week before and inside was one pair of black underwear with what looked like a white substance. I didn’t accuse but just asked and she said she must had forgot to grab those when doing laundry. Um ok ? So as time went on we both just became more and more distant . We had moved in together 4 months in and that’s when all this I started to notice.  She had a lot of school debt in which it was causing her a lot of stress, well her and her aunt are pretty close. She said her aunt was going to lend her some money. Ok kool , IAsked how much and she said a couple of grand. Um what?  Who has a couple grand to spare these days. But ok fine ..Well after 8 months we called it quits and it’s been 2 months I have recently been told by a friend thatcher saw her at a club stripping.  Like wow.  She is the best actress I’ve ever seen. Claiming she loves me and build. But the whole time she’s stripping Should I reach out and see why she falsely loved me TL;DR : it was all true my( 32m) ex gf (27) was stripping behind my back the whole relationship",".The things she'd said about her family, about herself.They were all true.But the thing she hadn't realized was that they were also all lies.Every bit of it was a fabrication, a story she'd made up in order to protect herself and her loved ones.She'd never told them the truth about anything, not even to herself.And now, here in the safety of the clinic, she had the chance to finally tell them the truth.The truth about her family, her origin, her life before the hospital.The truth about the person she really was.But she couldn't do it.She couldn't bring herself to tell them the truth.She was ashamed, embarrassed, and terrified of what they might think of her.What if they didn't believe her?What if they rejected her for who she was?What if they never wanted to see her again?No, she couldn't do it.She couldn't tell them the truth.And that was why she'd lied to them all these years.It was why she'd kept them in the dark, why she'd never let them see the real her.Because she didn't want them to reject her, to think she wasn't good enough.But now, she knew, it was too late.The truth was out, and she couldn't hide it anymore.She had to face them and tell them the truth, no matter what the cost."

I used to have a business repairing phones and tech on the side.Sure, however when I got to fixing it back at my place. It was broken badly, smashed a little, water had gone everywhere etc. I decided to buy him a new phone. After I'd gotten the phone, I wanted to surprise him so, I invited him to my place.As I was doing that, I used his icloud to recover his data and put it into his new phone. When you do that, imessages are retrieved too.""Your **** was good last night"" etc.A flood of texts came in on the notification bar from various times. It was heartbreak I'm still hurt. I'm still hurt. I didn't want to believe it and as he arrived I gave him the phone and didn't say a word. I attempted to be okay. He thanked me and I told him that I couldn't hang out as my period pains were bad. He bought it and left.A few days later I wanted to confirm what I saw. I grabbed his phone after I'd slept over at his place. He hadn't put a pin in, so I unlocked it....He had slept with the girl when he'd left after I gave him the phone.I immediately threw up in the bathroom, I didn't know what to do so I left his place and told him that I left early due to an assignment.I don't know what to do now.

"413","Need advice: My(24M) girlfriend(23F) suddenly says she doesn't feel the same after our breakup, not sure what to do","So, just to give you some background, my girlfriend and I have been together since 2017. She was crazy about me when we started our relationship and everything went smoothly. However, I messed up and started a fight for no reason, and we ended up breaking up in 2020. Looking back, I realize that I wasn't mature enough at the time. After the breakup, we both started seeing other people and even started new relationships. However, my new relationship wasn't religiously compatible, so I ended it. After two months of our breakup she came back to me saying she couldn't live without me. We started seeing each other again, and I did my best to not repeat my past mistake and everything went smoothly. However, I noticed some changes in her since she went abroad for her studies a year ago, but I didn't think much of it at the time and tried to be supportive for her studies. Just yesterday, she suddenly told me that she isn't feeling the same way about me as she did before our breakup. I was shocked and confused. She said that she thinks she's fooling herself and me. When I asked her why she didn't tell me for the past three years since we started our relationship again, she said she was trying hard to feel the same way about me. She said she needs some time alone to figure things out, and I'm not sure what to do. It's unclear for her too whether her change of feelings happened after our breakup or after she went abroad for studies.TL;DR: Yesterday, my girlfriend told me that she's not feeling the same way about me as she did before the breakup and needs some time alone to figure things out. It's unclear when her change of feelings occurred.","In the event that your girlfriend suddenly says that she no longer feels the same after your breakup, it is important to take her feelings seriously. It is possible that she is just experiencing a difficult time right now, and she may need some time to heal. However, if she does not express this sentiment in a clear and concise way, it may be difficult to know what to do. It might be helpful to talk to her about her feelings, and to see if there is anything that you can do to help her. If she does not want to talk about it, it may be best to respect her wishes and stay away from her until she is ready to talk."
"414","My (25F) housemate (27F) is a neatfreak & I’m unsure how to handle it","Let me preface this by saying she’s absolutely lovely in every other regard & I have no intention to want to move out. I believe she has OCD, having dealt with it myself. Hers however pertains more towards cleaning and having everything exactly how she wants it to be. I feel bad cause I’m trying my absolute hardest to keep up despite having an insane work schedule of late (I work freelance & am averaging 50hrs+ per week so I am TIRED) and can’t follow her rituals to a T. And my tolerance window is very small at the moment in general like I really am busting my ass out here trying to maintain everything. I’m just curious how to navigate this because I know the irrational urges that come up with OCD but I also get triggered being watched and told what to do every 5 seconds especially when I have so much other stuff on my plate.It’s literally things like not folding up shopping bags in origami to fit neatly in a drawer or putting a stick sponge upright after washing my dishes. Its just very random and irrational, it gets much worse when her partner (a friend of mine) comes over also. And I don’t know how to navigate not triggering her & showing her I care about her, whilst also not getting triggered myself because I cant remember the 100s of specific things I’m meant to do amongst my other demandsTldr: housemate has compulsions and constantly telling me to do them & its driving me nutsEdit: forgot to mention I have adhd so keeping up is fucking exhausting","Assuming your housemate is trying to clean in a way that makes the space more aesthetically pleasing to them, it's okay to let them know that you appreciate their efforts. However, if they're cleaning in a way that's causing problems or is making the house feel dirty and chaotic, it might be best to try and talk to them about why they're cleaning in this way and see if there's a way to adjust their cleaning schedule or methods."
"415","Should I relinquish my preoccupation with ""serious"" relationships?","I (20F) take things seriously, and always have. I am reflective and careful by temperament. However, this seems to only bring trouble in the social sphere. Recently, I have been wondering whether it would be healthier to allow more casual connections in my life, knowing that there are no substantive or long-term prospects.The person I fell in love with (22M) does not want to be committed or exclusive. I spent a while thinking I would have to separate myself from him definitively, but now that my emotions have softened somewhat, I am considering meeting him on his level—being friends, having some romantic–physical moments alongside that, meeting relatively frequently but not with the consistency of a relationship. Several others in my life are interested in something similar, some older (which I never expected, as I do not see myself as a desirable presence at all—I am working on self-compassion).Even writing that does still break my heart a little. Even if I think I am slowly becoming capable of casual relations, I have reservations:* Without even realising it, I could still harbour false hopes, and my emotions could grow. That said, hurt and heartache are part of life. I should not be obsessively cautious.* Perhaps a future serious partner (if I am ever so lucky to have one) would look down on me for engaging in these more casual relationships, particularly the sexual aspects.* I would have to be more discreet, as I live with family, and am embarrassed by explaining encounters not within the context of a relationship.* Perhaps I should just be patient.Much of this deliberation comes from a deep-set place of self-hatred. I am still working on viewing myself with less vitriol. I have never been in a proper relationship, and honestly never expect myself to be worthy of one. I just wish I could enjoy these moments of pleasure and companionship without overthinking everything.TLDR: I (20F) am wondering whether to let go of my preoccupation with commitment, exclusivity, clear definitions. Should I try to be more light-hearted, casual, free? Is that ultimately the self-compassionate path to take? Taking things too seriously rarely ends well. Any insight or personal experience would be appreciated!","This is a difficult question. If you are finding that your preoccupation with ""serious"" relationships is interfering with your ability to have healthy and enjoyable relationships, then it may be time to reconsider your priorities. On the other hand, if you believe that a ""serious"" relationship is what you are meant to be focused on, then it is important to find a way to integrate your preoccupation with ""serious"" relationships into your overall life plan and strategy. Counseling or therapy may be a good way to explore these feelings and figure out a way to manage them."
"416","Fiancé (m27) & Brother (m20) Binge Drink","TL;DR My fiancé and brother stay up binge drinking until the wee hours of the morning on nearly every family vacation and wreak havoc on everyone else’s sleep schedules with no regard. It’s 1:38 AM eastern time (11:38 mountain). Everyone went to sleep over an hour ago. I ended up trying to talk my sister down when she started freaking out because my fiancé and younger brother wanted to stay up later, drinking more, and listening to music. Mind you we were all up at 5 AM eastern time today, had a huge travel day, an incredible time with breakfast, dinner, drinks, etc. AND we’re going to be skiing by 9 AM tomorrow. This is a recurring pattern where nearly every time I’m with my family overnight and my fiancé, my brother and fiancé end up staying up until 4/5 AM getting absolutely slammed and often disturbing the rest of the family. To the point that on family vacations, my other siblings and parents actively debate over who gets the quietest possible room furthest away from them. Why doesn’t my fiancé (27) and younger brother (20) respect other people? Should I just let them be?? Am I being controlling? What do I do?","ersMy fiance is a binge drinker and my brother is too. We've noticed that our relationship has been affected by their drinking. They've been argumentative and not listening to me. I want to get them help but don't know how to approach it."
"417","I am invisible to my bf when there’s someone else in the room","My boyfriend and I have lived together for a while and we moved into a new house 2 months ago with his sister to help her out. Him and I have a healthy relationship and we spend a lot of time with each other, have very similar sense of humor, and we are usually discussing something or play fighting or joking around when there’s nothing else we’re doing. I haven’t known his sister for a long time, because she is 3 years older than us and hasnt spoke to him or their parents in the last couple years since she moved in with her boyfriend, but they broke up and he moved out so my bfs mom asked us to move in with her so she could make rent. I have a good relationship with his sister so far, we hang out for hours sometimes when my bf isn’t home. She is somewhat of a hermit and has severe depression and I recently took her out to eat & she said she hasn’t been out of the house in 6 months. She’s nice and a good person but she rarely comes out of her room and never wants to be bothered. My bf and her really love gaming and it’s pretty much all both of them do. I like to game but it’s not something I’ve spent tons of time and money on. I take her to work and pick up down the road every day. Same with my bf. My bf likes to collect old consoles and sometimes he’ll show her the stuff he buys or we’ll all be in the same room talking like normal roommates. But it’s like every time I speak it is always ignored by both of them. I understand that they like to talk about gaming often so if I’m not part of the convo I go on my phone or leave the room to go do something else. But then my boyfriend will be upset that I walked away. I’ve brought this up so many times. To both of them. Nothing has changed. I’m not trying to intrude on their relationship but it hurts to be ignoredEdit: I sat down with him and told him what first commenter said and he agreed with me. He said he doesn’t mean to do it but he missed out on bonding with his sister in their childhood and I totally understand that. I accept that I didn’t grow up on the same interests as them but my interests are just as valid. I have been trying to make more friends who share my interests and I will continue to do so. I do share some interests with both of them together and individually so I will go off of that for nowTL;DR: my bf ignores me when other people are around but gets upset when I stop trying to be part of the conversation. I bring it up, he apologizes, then it happens again.","There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the situation will vary depending on your bf's personality and relationship with the other person. However, one potential solution is to try communicating with your bf about your concerns and hoping that he'll respect your wishes and stay away from the other person."
"418","My (30f) boyfriend (28m) just ""joke"" broke up with me by text.","I'm completely shaken up right now and mostly want to type this out. I (30f) have been dating my boyfriend for about 3 months and just received the following text from him, at about midnight:""I'm going through a lot roght now and I need some space. I can only offer to be friends and nothing more.""I called him immediately and he picked up. He said that his manager from work texted me something from his phone and he didnt' even know what was sent. I read him the message and he didn't really react; I think he is really drunk and I've seen him like this once before where he wasn't really responsive or able to empathize with me because he was blackout. He kind of hung up on me and I texted him that I was upset and he texted back the letter ""Q"" and that was it.I'm basically panicking just because the whole thing was so messed up and shocking. He is generally very sweet and very kind but obviously this was incredibly jarring, I am also considering the word abusive, or at least cruel-- to fuck with my emotions and then leave me no choice but to basically have a panic attack at my house alone until he sobers up. I also don't want to deal with this shit all of tomorrow-- I have stuff to do.Any thoughts are welcome and appreciated, even if it's just validation that that was really not okay, and that I didn't deserve it. Thanks.TLDR: My boyfriend's ""manager"" sent me a break up text at midnight and now I have zero idea what to do or how to calm down.","It sounds like your boyfriend may have been joking when he broke up with you by text. If he was serious about breaking up with you, he would have done it in a more direct way. It sounds like he was just trying to hurt your feelings. If this is the case, you might want to talk to him about it and ask why he did this."
"419","I just need some help understanding this a little better","Ill make this as short as possible and just give most of the main parts of my situation with this girl I've been involved with on and off for a bit over half of a year or so.So I 26m understand to some extent because I've had emotionally and physically abusive girlfriends in the past and it was so hard to leave because I was clinging to the distant past and change can be difficult at times. She 21f was staying with this guy 33m (I think) she didn't even have romantic feelings for. He was bad to her in a lot of ways and kept her high on coke and other drugs that she didn't want to be doing anymore. It's not easy to stop when it's right there in your face all the time and  you're going through so much. But in the end he flew off the handle and beat he, he had the stupidest of reasons to make it worse (there is truly never any reason to do this to anyone but they always have some reason in there twisted diluted minds). So she left after that and we ended up reconnecting. Things where great and we pretty much just picked where we left off. She was going through a hell of a lot in life though so we decided we would just be friends for now. She still faded away very fast unfortunately. She texted me one day to explain why. She needed to focus on the class for the job she's trying to get, her son, herself, and so on. That being consistent friends would be difficult rightnow and that I was too good for her, to kind too caring and she was scared of hurting my son and I. I can get that even though it hurts. But I'm positive shes relapsed and let her abuser back in. So some level I can understand most of this but I need to hear what others thibk and have to say. Please and thank you everyone.TL;DR! To sum it up we were on and off for a little over half year or so but felt strongly for eachother. She got involved with an abuser that kept her on drugs. He beat her and she left the situation. We ended up reconnecting and it was great but she had too much going on and didn't want to hurt me so she dissappeared. Now I'm pretty positive shes let the abuser back into her life and relapsed  .","The article is discussing the decline of the coal industry in the United States.

I had 2 other relationships, but he is the one that stuck with me through it all. I always had him in the back of my mind, everyday, for the last 5 years. We were so happy together, we loved each other so much and i find myself reminiscing on the good old times. We broke up 3 years ago after 2 years together because i had to move from our town after my father passed away, and because it all hurt to much, we decided to cut all contact between us. Now, three years later, since we started uni, we live in the same city. I always hope to see him everywhere i go just to have an excuse to talk to him. I found out 6 months ago that he has a girlfriend of a year now, and I would feel like the most terrible human being for reaching out, but i cant get my mind off of him.I know many of you might think that I am delusional. That we were just kids when we were together. And that s true. But I just know it. I always knew or hoped that one day we will find our way back to each other somehow and my intuition is telling me that he feels the same. I know it sounds crazy, but i just feel it. I always felt it. I truly believe he is my soulmate. He is the only person that ever made me feel understood, completely. He s the one I could listen to talking for hours and never get bored. I love him woth all my heart. I know that s no excuse to interfere in someone else s relathionship, and that s not what i want to do. I just miss him, so so much. Even as just a friend. I love him so much that I would be happy with just talking to him from time to time, from the distance. I just wish I could have him back in my life.

We have been married for three months, and dated for a year. I’ve caught him in a few lies that were very unnecessary, the biggest lie being that he took out a loan before we got married without telling me(we we’re already dating seriously, and fortunately it wasn’t a lot of money ). No lie has put us in great jeopardy yet, but I have told him we will only  communicate if it’s necessary i.e normal greeting, do you want food, I’m going out etc. he feels as if I’m being unfair, but I think otherwise. Why would I be vulnerable and always look out for a lie? I catch him in a lie at least every second day, and it hurts a lot. I am worried about the lies I haven’t figured out, like the loan that came out 10 months after it was taken. He says he will change, but how can you change overnight when you’ve been asked to stop lying for a year. I’ll stick to not be vulnerable with him, in case his lies start breaking me . TL; DR : My husband is a compulsive liar. Am I wrong from cutting any vulnerability from my side, because the lies hurt each time they happen?","No, you are not unfair for cutting down on communication with your compulsive lying husband.

If communication becomes too difficult or painful for either party, it may be best to seek professional help."
"424","I (25F) have never been in a relationship","I guess I should start off by saying this is somewhat by choice. I am an attractive and confident woman who has been in many “situationships” and being in a relationship has never been a fear of mine. I look forward to it actually. I look forward to that comfort and having a person I know I can turn to, but I have had so much trouble finding that and maybe it subconsciously IS a fear. I’ve gone to so many therapists that have done their best to help me through my issues but I’ve never really found a solution. I’m actually 24 going on 25 this next month and it’s starting to freak me out how alone I am as I watch friends move on from their single life and settle down. It’s getting scarier.In sixth grade I had my first real crush. We were best friends and I still remember the day he asked me to be his girlfriend. We were only 12 so it obviously wasn’t that serious but what I still remember from this incident is how much I liked him and how I rejected him. Could a 6th grader really show early signs of commitment issues? Since then it’s been downhill. My parents did have a rocky relationship and we’re always on and off throughout my childhood. My dad showed little to no physical affection to my mom and vice versa. They eventually had a messy divorce that lasted 3 years while I was in high school. Every time I start dating a guy it all feels fake. I’m very rarely even attracted to a someone. The closest I’ve gotten to a serious relationship was a 6 year on and off “situationship” which I could seriously write an entire novel on and maybe I’ll make a separate post about it. He was one of the only guys I’ve ever been physically and mentally attracted to. I feel like I’m extremely picky. I also feel like I chased him when usually I’m the one who is being chased.That’s now over and probably for the best, but I have to wonder if I have commitment issues. I say I want something serious but maybe I don’t know what that entails. Or maybe I haven’t met the person. I guess my questions is how do I prepare myself for love if I do have commitment issues? Or could it just be that I haven’t met the right person?TL;DR: I’ve been single my whole life and don’t know if these are commitment issues or me just not finding the right person.","I (25F) have been in a relationship once."
"425","How to balance opposite social lives and needs?","My (23F) boyfriend (24M) and I have been together just over 4 months now. We both have known that some aspects of our lives are very different, namely our social lives. He has a sizable group of friends he sees every week for DND and other group hangouts, in addition to other friends not affiliated with the group he also sees. It seems like he always has something booked in his free time with somebody or is being asked to hang out. On the other hand I don't have as many friends, and the ones I do I'm not able to see very often due to work schedules and distance between us. Our living situations are even like this- he lives in a small condo with 3 family members and shares a room with his stepbrother, while I live in a large (in comparison) townhouse with just my mom (I'm an only child). The problem is that while he hardly gets any alone time, I get too much. I feel clingy and needy for wanting to be with him so much, but hes the only person in my life thats not family that i see consistently. But with how much he has going on in his life he of course doesn't feel as much of an intense need to see me (outside of the regular amount of him wanting to be with me due to us being a couple). I'm just worried this difference between us is going to be a problem in the future and want advice on what I can do or how we can balance it Tl;dr: my boyfriend is never alone and I'm always alone and I don't know how to balance our social needs","It can be difficult to balance opposite social lives and needs, but it is important to ensure that both parties are happy. Here are a few tips to help:1. Talk to your partner about what they want and need from their social life.2. Make time for both your social and personal lives.3. Be honest with each other about how you are feeling.4. Give and receive feedback constructively.5. Let go of negative thoughts and feelings about your partner’s social life."
"426","My ex(21 F) broke up with me (22 M)","Need some genuine advice hereHi guys. I need some advice here as I'm stuck in a sort of emotional quicksand here.My 5 year long relationship came to an end recently. And I duly accept the fault for it. It was my behavior issues that led to this split. I realized I messed up and  how much I hurt my ex gf. Now that she's gone, I am trying to improve myself to be a better person overall so that this never happens with anyone in my life ahead. The problem is that we had a very strong emotional bond which makes it really hard for both of us to move on. She made it a very clear that we aren't in a relationship anymore and that she isn't able to fix things even though she wants to. And I respected her decision (no matter how hard it was) and I decided to move out of her life and let her move on peacefully Now the problem is that she kept texting me every week or two after this breakup thing. And everytime I got these texts I went back to same old mental breakdown state that I was in when she first mentioned the split up. I called her up today and we talked for more than an hour, only to hear her say that she is unable to fix things even if she wants to. And when I mentioned the texts, she said she won't do it again.I really love her alot but I am not able understand what is going on here. Will she ever come back ? Or is she just texting me until she finds someone else to be with ? What should I do ?Tl;dr - I am not blaming her anywhere. I know it's my actions that have led to this situation. I'm just seeking some advice for myself here."," 2 weeks agoI'm really sad."

Right now it's long distance as they're back home and I moved states, but I'm visiting soon.We were both addicts and alcoholics, they still have a problem with the liquor but I'm in recovery now and currently working my 4th step which entails looking over your patterns of behavior and your part in them, and I wrote some stuff about my current relationship and it made me realize how unsure I am. I don't know how to rephrase it or sum it up so I'll just put down exactly what I wrote""I resent ____ because I feel like they're distant and that makes me insecure and worried that they're going to leave me. I'm worried they're going to lose interest like I am and they won't be an option any more and that scares me. I'm scared they're another face of the same relationship I've had with different people for years and I don't want to know I lost someone else because I'm not capable of genuine love. I want them to be special and not just another filler relationship that implodes after a few months. I feel like I have an empty void inside of me that can be filled with love, friends, sex, or drugs, but I know that it doesn't work that way and I'm scared that I'll find I don't really love _____ and will have to leave them to break this pattern.""I want them to be special, I want to love them but I don't know if/why I want that with them specifically or why they're special. I haven't really been single since I was 18 and sort of just gone from person to person in this vicious cycle. They're fucking hot and I've wanted to date them since I was a teenager which on a superficial level makes me feel the urge to keep things going because I'm *supposed* to want them. We're really similar and have the same mindset on so much shit and basically grew up together and are into similar shit; we can talk for hours and never get bored and it feels like they're another half of myself so I guess it just sorta seemed natural to date, but I don't want to use them as another placeholder and I'm so fucking scared it's going to end up being the same shit again.

"428","My (25M) gf (26F) of 4 years ignores me when she’s with her 2 guy friends every weekend.","I’m in a long distance relationship right now with my girlfriend of four years. She hangs out with her two guy friends literally every weekend(every weekend for the past ~3 months) gets drunk with them, has stayed over in their place many many times and ignores me the whole time she’s there. We’ve had fights multiple times in this topic and she says she won’t stay the night and drink but hasn’t kept her words. This has been going on for the past 5-6 months and we’ve been in really horrible fights about this. She tells me those friends are only source of fun for her in the new city and thinks I’m controlling her when I say I don’t liked her drinking and staying in their place.She initially didn’t even tell them she’s in a relationship and wouldn’t introduce me or talk about me with them. I’ve been staying thinking she’s the one for me but I’ve started doubting and don’t want to feel the anxiety when she ignores me every time she’s there. What should I do? I don’t want to leave her.TL;DR! Gf hangs out with same 2 guy friends every weekend, drinks and sleeps at their place and ignores me the whole time. What should I do?","There could be a number of reasons for why your girlfriend ignores you when she's with her two male friends on the weekends. It could be that she's enjoying herself and doesn't want to disturb your time together, or it could be that she's feeling uncomfortable with the situation and doesn't want to make any negative waves. However, the reason doesn't really matter as long as she's not ignoring you intentionally. If she's willing to talk to you when she's not with her friends, you should be willing to talk to her about why she's avoiding you. If she's unwilling or unable to talk to you, then there might be a problem that needs to be addressed."
"429","Different goals and dreams in my relationship (24M 22F)","TLDR: My partner and I have different relationship goals, interests, and schedules. While she wants to settle down, I want to travel and wait until later to get married. I'm torn between staying and pursuing my dreams or breaking things off and starting anew. Any advice would be appreciated.Hey Reddit,I'm in a tough spot with my current relationship and I'm looking for some advice on what I should do. My partner and I have been together for almost four years, and we've lived together for three. However, with me finishing university in two months, I'm looking to work and travel abroad starting at the end of this year or early next year. While my partner still has two more years of university and isn't interested in traveling after.One of the main issues is that we seem to want different things in our relationship. She keeps talking about getting engaged and married, but I would rather wait until my late 20s or early 30s. I've talked to her about this multiple times, but it seems like we're on different pages.Additionally, we have different interests and preferences when it comes to music, TV shows, hobbies, and even food. We also have different sleep schedules, as she's more of a ""night owl"" while I prefer to be in a regular sleeping pattern due to my 8am-5pm job.To make matters worse, we've drifted apart over the past few months due to different work schedules and university. We don't spend as much time together as we used to, and when we do, it feels like we're just going through the motions.While this is my first serious relationship, I'm starting to feel like we want different things and it's causing some tension. I still have love for her, but I'm not sure if we're compatible in the long run. I've thought about breaking things off between us, but I'm not sure if I'm just overthinking everything.When I spoke to my family and friends, they suggested that I shouldn't let my partner hold me back from anything I want to do. I'm torn between staying in the relationship and pursuing my goals or breaking things off and starting a new chapter in my life. I keep thinking “you only live once”.Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.","In my relationship, I would like to achieve two goals: 1) to have a strong and lasting relationship that is rooted in mutual respect and understanding; and 2) to be able to openly and freely discuss any issues or problems that come up, so that both parties can work together to resolve them.

"430","My (24F) boyfriend (22M) subbed to my sister's OF. I think it's part of a wider porn addiction and I don't know what to do.","I need help. I don't know if this is the right sub to post in so I'm really sorry if this shouldn't be here. I am also posting this from mobile. My boyfriend C and I have been together for about two and a half years. We're getting ready to move in together in about a month. A long time ago, he admitted to me he used to have a porn addiction and watched at least six times a day, I think it was. Fast forward to now, I was doing some trainings on his PC and I needed to use his email to find a class name. I ended up seeing he subbed to my sister's OF and her Fansly. I don't care about porn but this hurt and disgusted me. He knows it is her. He can see her face. I was shaken and he was sleeping. I got up and went to the bed and he'd fallen asleep to a YouTube video. His phone was unlocked so I took it. I looked through SC and saw he was sending pictures to another girl too. I don't know who but I saw some saved photos and needless to say, they are sexting. What hurt the most there were the time stamps; we were having good times that night while he was doing that. And he drove to my home then sent snaps to this girl before coming into bed with meBefore it becomes a vent, I just don't know what to do. Common sense says to leave him. But I struggle knowing he's perfect for me otherwise. I know it's cliche but lying here had me crying wishing something so wonderful wasn't ruined this way. I don't know if this is an extreme porn addiction manifesting, or if I'm just trying my best to cope with that excuse. I realize I'm hiding the fact this happened before because I know I'll be shamed. But it has. Earlier on in our relationship, I was talking about the site and mentioned my sister had one. We were with friends and we're (my sister and I) not ashamed of it, and she's okay with me talking  about it. I thought nothing of it until I saw a mention of the subscription months later, as we were looking through his emails in the middle of Petco trying to adopt a cat for him...I just feel lost. Any advice is welcome. I love this man dearly but I know I need self respect, and to respect my sister. But I can't help thinking maybe this is something extreme and he needs help? I am lost and feel completely drained. Please helpTL;DR My boyfriend subbed to two porn creator content pages for my sister and sexts another girl. He has confessed to a previous porn addiction and I wonder if that is it manifesting.","There might be a few factors at play here, including a possible porn addiction on your boyfriend's part and a possible power dynamic in your relationship. You might want to speak to your sister about this and see what she thinks is going on. Additionally, you might want to talk to your boyfriend about why he'ssubbing to her OF and see if he has any explanations. If he doesn't have any explanations and the porn addiction is just on his part, you might want to work on repairing the power dynamic in your relationship so that you can have a healthier relationship overall."
"431","Questioning my (23F) LDR with my bf (22M)","I've been in a LDR with my bf for about 4 months, knew him for about a year before we got together, and while I really like him, there are things that make me question if he's really ready for a relationship/compatible with me. He is really kind and fun to talk to, but I'm not sure if this is the way someone who is into me would act.First, it doesn't seem like out time together is valuable to him. We are unable to see each other more than once every couple of months at this time. I travelled to see him, and he didn't meet me at the airport or see me off. I understand he doesn't have a car, but I was hoping he would offer to do at least one of the two when the airport is only a 15 min uber ride. I paid for my own travel expenses, so it wasn't like I asked him to spend a lot for me to visit him. I also paid for some of the things we did, and he paid for others. When we went out, he would be on his phone during meals and would usually walk several feet in front of me (I'm short, so walking the same speed as a 6ft guy who is walking fast is difficult over a distance).Second, he also forgot my birthday. I know we haven't been together for long and wasn't expecting any gifts, but I just wanted a nice text or something. I also know he texts his gaming friends happy birthday without needing reminders so he is fine at remembering dates. He has also skipped phone calls with me to play games with his friends, saying our plans ""slipped his mind"" which he says about a lot of things.Overall, I don't feel like I'm very important to him. I'm generally an insecure person though, so I'm just looking for feedback to know if I'm overreacting and making a big deal out of nothing, as I do really enjoy him.TL;DR Not sure if my LDR bf is actually into me/puts effort in because he forgets dates and is always scrolling on his phone when we see each other","Hey!

There was a point in the beginning where we were sleeping with each other and hanging out a lot but we weren’t fully getting along. We had ended it once and she had hit up her previous guy and they slept together. I didn’t find out about this til a couple months later when we tried again. After this we came to a conclusion to start on a new page and be better both me and her. Things have been alright and going well, but more recently she lied to me about going on a trip. Today is when i kinda found out through her friends posts. It’s odd because she lied about going for a month and even the past few days (as she’s there) she’s been telling me she is not there. “Do you want me to send my location” she also got super defensive and mad anytime I asked if she was there. I really have love for this woman and have wanted to make it work, but tell me is this even valid to be trying anymore?

"433","I Think my Dad is Cheating on my Mom and I Don't Know What to do.","I have no idea where else I would ask this, and I don't know what to do. I just feel sick. I want to vomit. I am a 15-year-old female. My Mom is 49, and so is my dad, they are in fact married. I know I shouldn't be seeking advice on the internet, but I don't know who I would go to for help. I don't know what to do without someone possibly being hurt. I am just going to get to the point.Here's some background information. Maybe I am wrong, but I think that my dad may be legitimately cheating on my mom:I was getting in the car to go somewhere. He told me to text my mom, telling her we are on our way to the place. I opened his phone and the first thing that popped up was a text conversation. I thought it was my Mom because, so I just went to hit the back button, but right as I went to hit the button, the contact name was not my mom's. Then, I saw the first 6 messages between him and a woman that I know for a FACT was not his co-worker. The messages were my Dad telling this woman how she was photogenic and pretty. She replied ""Thanks babe.""  My Dad said he was going to go to the same gym as her so they could hang out. I didn't want to look at anything more and just exited out of it because I was so scared. I want to tell my Mom, but I'm scared she won't believe me, or my Dad will hate me because I am the one that ruined his life. I don't want to end up in the middle of a divorce eitherbecause I might never see my Dad again because he'll probably be mad at me for telling my mom. What should I do?TL;DR: My Dad was texting another woman, I think flirting with her and she was not my mother, who my after is married to. What should I do?","This can be a difficult question to answer because there are so many factors that need to be considered. If your parent is openly cheating on your mother, then you may be able to confront them and ask them to end their relationship. If your parent is cheating behind your mother's back, then you may have a harder time figuring out what to do. It may be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you explore your thoughts and feelings. It may also be helpful to talk to a friend or family member who can provide support."
"434","My (21F) boyfriend (22M) lied to me about spending his money on 🍃","My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We have both never had a problem with 🍃 and both do it ourselves. My boyfriend and I are saving up to buy an apartment but with how expensive 🍃 is and just everything in general, we have both agreed that we need to save up as much as possible. My boyfriend doesn’t work and only works for his dads company when he wants to, but when he gets money he tends to go and immediately spend it on 🍃. And I mean pretty much every penny is spent. I had a talk with him a while ago that I’m concerned about his spending habits because he always says how he wants to move out, but spends all of his money as soon as he gets it. He knows I’ve been saving up all of my money too at the moment so we can both move out together. We both came to an agreement that saving money for an apartment is more important at the moment. Recently after work, he told me he was gonna go to the park while he was waiting on a family member, but there was a time where he stopped responding mid-convo (which is unlike him) and that concerned me so I checked his location (we both share our location in case of an emergency). I saw that he was at the 🍃 store and eventually he texted me saying that he had to stop at some park real quick to use the bathroom and that he will text me when he gets to the other park. Obviously that wasn’t true since he went to get “stuff” so I waited till he got to the park to call him. When I facetimed him he wouldn’t show his face and said that I will think he looks “lit” even though he’s just tired. I have been around him long enough to know how he acts when he is under the influence, and this man definitely was and denied it no matter what I said. He told me “I’ve been at the park for a long time” even though he texted me “I just got to the park” about 10 minutes before. He continued to lie to my face about it so I hung up after he said he had to go. I don’t know if I am being paranoid and should just let it go? I understand wanting to go get some, but I don’t understand why he would lie about it so much. Any advice?

In just under a year from now, she and her family plan to go on a vacation and she wants me to come. I would honestly love to go but there are a few issues. I live alone in my own place and make just enough to keep my head above water. I am very frugal and like to save money. I save it for retirement as well as investing so I can make more money to keep myself afloat. I certainly have the funds but I am not the type to blow it all on a vacation. I prefer to spend extra money on nice dinners occasionally or a movie out. The little things. It costs around 2 grand for just me alone to go. I’m also introverted and am not a big fan of crowds or loud noises. My gf doesn’t like to save money but plans to do so for the trip.  She believes in the idea of if you got money you should spend it because yolo and money for memories is important to her. She lives with her family and is able to save up money for the vacation. She also keeps trying to convince me and wants me to just use up what she calls a tiny portion of my hard earned savings to go with her. She and her family are travelers, they love traveling and going places. I am not. I love this girl and I’d love to go. But I’m forced to recognize we have different values and goals in life and I’m not starting to wonder if we are truly right for each other. I think I should go both because I’d like to and it would be good for our relationship but I’m worried what might happen between then and now, such as us breaking up. Any advice would be helpful. Edit: I forgot to mention the main reason I’m concerned is that I have to pay the amount in advance. Like within the next week. Which is what has me concerned in case we break up or god knows what happens between now and the nearly a year later to then. Tl;dr: I don’t know if I want to go on vaca with my gf because it is expensive and I am having doubts.","There is no definitive answer to this question since it will depend on a variety of factors specific to your relationship. Some things that might influence your decision include whether you believe that the trip is worth the expense, whether your girlfriend is willing to make some sacrifices in order to finance the trip, and your financial stability. Ultimately, it's up to you whether you decide to go on the vacation or not, and spending money on a vacation is not necessarily a bad thing."

It was mostly verbal, plus breaking things and overall aggression, so he's only hurt me on very few occasions and never badly.Things really escalated this last summer. He started drinking 24/7 and stopped going to work. My mom, grandmother, and sister usually know how to deal with him by staying quiet and taking it in, but I lose my temper or leave. It began a vicious cycle where he would drink and find a reason to get mad at me, I would leave, and he would get much much madder. He broke down my door, would choke me, and overall just keep me locked in my bedroom. My sister would bring me meals and try to keep me safe from him. She even had to spend a night in the psych ward for wanting to kill him to keep us all safe.I even spent a few nights at my friends or boyfriends house, which is very against my parents rules and only made him madder. CPS was called and we stayed with family for a few weeks, and he eventually moved out, disowned me, and asked my mom for a divorce.I thought it would be over once he left, but it's still been hard for all of us and I'm starting to think I'm the asshole here. I know I drove him into getting more violent, at first just by being there but later by breaking his rules and leaving or ignoring him. My mom is emotionally lost without my dad and struggles to pay for everything on just one salary. My sister is actually doing better, but I know they had a really special bond too. Even I ""grieve"" my father. I realized that a lot of the distance I felt growing up was because of his depression, and he was just trying to be a good dad in the way he knew best. It's been 9 months since I've talked to him but I feel guilty every day for destroying our family, and I know my mom will never fully forgive me for it. I haven't stayed at home since then and feel selfish for ruining what they had.&#x200B;TL;DR: my relationship with my dad ruined the family, and I can't stop feeling guilty about it.","I feel so guilty for making my dad leave the family. It feels like I'm the one who caused all the pain and turmoil in the family. I feel like I'm the one who made my dad leave."
"440","(23M) BF’s sister made him sound threatening to their parents","I (22F) went on a cruise this past week with my boyfriend’s family. i’ve hung out with them and seen them a lot before this trip. i’ve had a pretty decent relationship with his sister (21F) and felt like i could confide in her, especially since i don’t have many friends and no siblings. the truth is everyone deals with something. and sometimes when my boyfriend gets mad he can be a bit explosive. but he’s never put his hands on me or been physically abusive. the second night of the cruise we were arguing and he punched the wall in the shower. of course i felt a little uneasy after but he calmed down, took a nap, and we had a good rest of the night. Maintenance patched it while we were gone the next day. the next night i went drinking with his sister and we both got so drunk, and she said she notices he doesn’t talk to me the best sometimes. and touched on his slight anger issues/ their sibling fights. i ended up telling her what happened but asked her not to tell anyone. his sister and i ended up passing out on the pool deck and waking up at 4am. we were walking back to our separate rooms and i saw my boyfriend walking around looking for us. i was drunk and knew i shouldn’t have been out that late, so i panicked and ran around the corner even though he already saw me. i told her i was scared, but i didn’t mean it in a “he’s going to beat me” kind of way. he confronted us and when i told him we fell asleep he said i was lying and walked away. she told me to come in her room and i did for a little to avoid an argument with him. Now that we’re all back home, my boyfriend calls me today telling me his sister told their parents “his gf is scared of him” and probably insinuated other things. i know she was over dramatic because that’s how she is. now they’re worried about him being with me. i need advice on this situation because obviously i shouldn’t have trusted her, and now i’m wondering if my BF and i need to sit down with his parents and clear the air? should we even continue this relationship at this point? now it feels hopeless and they probably view my BF and i some way. help is appreciated.TL;DR sister told bf’s parents i’m “scared of him” and now they’re bringing it up to him and worried","BF’s sister made him sound threatening to their parents. She told their parents that BF was going to hurt them, and that he was a danger to them. This caused a rift between BF and their parents, and prevented BF from communicating with them."
"441","I think my gf (18f) is peer pressuring me (18m) to send nudes","I think I just need to write this to get it off my chest but, I am writing literally what the title said. Btw I also wrote about my girlfriend being difficult on another post, if anyone else would like to give me advice on that one. But ye last night she was messaging me and also for context were in a five month relationship, the second month in we started having sex and after she has been sending nudes to me, but I’ve never sent them back to her, I’ve talked about this before to her saying that I feel uncomfortable to send any nudes at all, and said it’s perfectly fine becuase if this that she doesn’t have to becuase I don’t, but she said she’ll keep sending hers becuase idk whatever rocks her boat. But we were taking last night and she says she misses my you know what and want to see it and she quickly follows up with a message and I quote, “oh ye I forgot you don’t like that kind of stuff” which I’m glad she remembered and realised but after we were talking and she was in a blatantly obvious mood and grump with me because I don’t send her a nude of me, I don’t know if I’m reading into it or overreacting but then she wash saying how she Misses my you know what and it’s going to be so long till she sees it, even tho I’m coming round the next day, and overall just trying to make me feel bad for not sending a nude to her. But I think I might be reading into it I just feel uncomfortable sending nudes and a little upset about her being upset with me because I didn’t send her what she wanted that I felt uncomfortable with. TL;DR - I just want to know your thoughts on this btw and to get it off my chest.","It's possible that your girlfriend is pressuring you to send nude photos. If you don't want to send them, it may be best to talk to her about it. Explain why you don't want to do this and see if she agrees. If she doesn't agree, you can break up."
"442","My bestfriend likes kissing me (both kinda straight 18M)","Hi everyone I live in a pretty religious society A few days ago my bestie told me that he wants to kiss my cheek , I was pretty surprised, I mean he is cute and all but that was unexpected, so I told him lets hang out tonight he said sure .We hung out in my car and after eating some snacks I held his hand and kissed it then he kissed mine , then he started heavily kissing my cheek and I would repeat whatever he does , until we stopped for whatever reason and started kissing on our lips , then it intensified with tongues being involved , then I jumped from my driver seat to his lap and pushed his chair backwards and we returned to heavy french kissing for over 2 hours , we felt exhausted and I put my head on his chest and started chatting about how great that felt , I asked him when should we do it again he said this was his last time and I was heartbroken but I knew I can’t force him .10 hours later , he asks me to do it again, and we did except this time we directly went into french kissing for 4 hours , and dare I say it was the most beautiful experience in my entire existence! It was so intense I gave him a large purple hickey .24 hours later after some chatting I realized that he came to me because he was horny so I felt objectified and used , but am trying to bring out the loving part of him , I feel that that was a pretty deep connection and I honestly expected him to be romantically connected, but looks like he isn’t, I told him what I feel but he even lessened his interactions with me 💔.What shall I do ?TL;DR :my straight friend kissed me but now doesn’t interact much .","Your bestfriend likes kissing you, but he or she is straight."
"443","Mom (54f) ignores when I tell her I’m going to do something (21f)","Hi.. this is complicated but I’ll try to make it short. I’m in a long distance relationship I’m (21f) my bf is (26m). And it’s really important to me to be able to go visit him. We’ve been planning a trip for a while.. like quite a while. And I’ve made two attempts to talk to my mom (54f) about wanting to go (it’ll be my first trip out of state by myself). But both times I’ve felt pushed off even though I’ve told her it’s important to me to be able to go. The first time she said she wanted me to make a plan and a timeline to make sure I’m safe going and that I could go soon.. it was disappointing but I went along with it because I want to respect what she has to say. So I took a week to put together a plan of what/where/how I’d get there and everything even times I’d leave/come home. But when I tried to ask her to look through it with me this morning she acted like she didn’t have the time of day to talk about it and all she said was “what vehicle are you going to drive, if you rent a car you’ll be charged extra. And you want to go by yourself???”.. and that was it, she changed the topic and started ranting about something else. I realize I’m an adult and I’m not trying to ask for her permission. Like I was trying to be polite and do the right thing but I feel like she just doesn’t care about what I want at all. Do I just make reservations and tell her one more time I’m going so she’s not surprised? Tl;dr I (21f) want to go see my long distance bf (26m), but when talking to my mom (54f) she acts like she won’t give me the time of day. Do I just make reservations and go?","Your mother may ignore your announcement that you are going to do something, depending on the context of the conversation. If she is happy to see you go, then she may not care. If she is upset or angry about something else, she may not want you leaving."
"444","Am I overreacting to be angry at my BF to miss all my stepstone celebration... unintentionally?","TL;DR:  I'm (35F) are becoming very angry and resentful against my long time BF (35M) of 15 year to miss all the stepstone and anniversary of my and our common life.  Issue is , it was never intentional. So Am I overreacting?\----We date since we are 21.  He miss my 25 birthday and my graduation because he was working as an intern 3000km away.Then he miss my 30 birthday because of some other work event (celebration of the 50 year of his enterprise) far away. He also forget our 5 and 10 year anniversaryHe miss my big promotion party because his train got blocked in a tunnel for 6 hours.(he got free transport for 6 month after that, so I guess it's true. )I'm currently pregnant. We couldn't make the announcement special between us, because we were in vacation with friends who binge drink constantly , so I need to tell him as soon as I discover it to be sure he would always serve me virgin version of the drink. So I had to announce him that while we were parking.We couldn't party for my 35 anniversary nor our 15 anniversary together because I was throwing up too much because of the pregnancy, and , frankly, he forget AGAIN despite the fact that I remember him 1 month before.","It's possible that you are overreacting to this, as it seems like your BF didn't intentionally miss your stepstone celebration. If your BF is important to you, you may want to talk to him about why he missed the event and see if he can make it up to you. If he doesn't seem to care much about the celebration or if he doesn't seem to understand how important it is to you, it may be time to reconsider your relationship with him."
"445","gf is friends with old hookup","I (20m) have been dating my gf (20f) for roughly 2 months and within that time learned that she is still friends with a previous hookup (23m). To elaborate, she told me directly that she previous slept with him but quickly realized they were better off as friends rather than fwb or potential partner. I've since then told her that if she really wanted him as a friend still that they can only hang out in a group setting (keep in mind I don't talk to any former partners/hookups). She was fine with the boundary I set but now he keeps trying to meet me and inviting me and my gf to places (my gf said he's taken and offered to introduce him to me if I'm still not comfortable ). I'm not too familiar with him as a person but I'm not really interested in meeting anyone my gf has had sex with in the past (Its weird to me and they also met within the same year we met so it's fairly recent). Ideally I wouldn't have to hear about any of my gf's former hookups but he's the only one she still talks to. Is it childish to not want anything to do with him, its not like my gf wants me to meet him or anything but I can't seem to avoid him.TLDR; Gf is still friends with an old hookup and now he keeps trying to meet me when I don't want to","No, GF is not friends with old hookup."
"446","why do i feel awful about BF (46m) wants to go out of town without me (36f)","My BF (46m) and I (36f) have been together 8yrs. His family & friends all live in another state. His close circle of friends have always followed the band Widespread Panic. He's always ranted and raved about how these shows were the best times of his life. He has made several trips home for concerts with his friends & family without me. I finally put my foot down after 7yrs and told him it was unacceptable that I haven't made the trip with him to meet his family and friends yet, so he took me to one of the shows last May. We had a blast. I need to point out that his way of ""planning"" these trips in prior years is hiding it from me and springing it on me a day or so before he gets on a plane to leave town. We've had issues in our relationship and hes caused abandonment trauma by packing his things up while I was at work one day, and i came home to an empty apartment after living together for 5 years. We currently are living together and have been for all but a month or so after the initial surprise move out stunt. I'm bringing this up bc I think it's why I'm so sensitive to these last minute trips out of town without me. I have zero problems with him going to a show with his friends, brother, and cousin. But he has lied in the past, there WILL be drugs and drinking involved, lots of them and I'm just not ok with this DIRE need to be away WITHOUT ME having the time of his life with his less than desirable behaviored posse. . I enjoy the band, I had a lot of fun when he took me last year. It seems to me that maybe I'm feeling hurt bc it's like he wants to get away from me AND the every day grind of life. Am I wrong? What can I do to alleviate the stress I have about these trips? TLDR: BF wants to go on trips without me. I feel hurt bc the option of me going isn't even considered. Sprinkled with prior abandonment trauma early in relationship.","If your partner wants to go out of town without you, it may be because they feel awful about the relationship. They may feel like they are abandoning you or that you are not worth spending time with. They may also feel like they are not good enough for you. If this is the case, it is important to reassure them that you care about them and want to be with them. It may also be helpful to talk about your feelings and why you are concerned about the relationship."
"447","Me [23F] and my boyfriend [22M] have talked about our past relationships and it seems like he might still be into his ""ex”, what do you think?"," My boyfriend (of 4 months) and I have talked about our past relationships recently and he mentioned about his recent ""ex"" (who is drop-dead gorgeous) saying how he was ""crazy about this girl"" he met during erasmus in 2021 in Spain.   When they had met she was in a relationship with another guy and he said how he was so in love with that relationship that he really wanted to have the same thing with her.   This guy she was dating eventually finished his semester and they broke up because he had to leave. So my boyfriend said how he did ""everything he could do to get this girl"" but she was a bit reluctant because she wanted to live her last month of erasmus as a single person as she wanted to stop jumping from a relationship to another. He said that they eventually hooked up a few times and he thought that it was growing into a relationship, but she seemed like she didn't want to because of the aforementioned reason. Eventually, he said that as their semester was ending, he started to think about all the reasons why it wouldn't work out and how she might not be right for him (I guess to protect himself?). After they both left, they kept contact for a while but ended up drifting apart. They met up again with other friends from erasmus last summer in Spain (2022) and he said how it was purely friendly between them because, as I quote, ""we only stayed 3 days so there was no point in opening up something again as we both knew that we would go back to our lives after, but it was purely friendly... at least for me it was"".I know that he made sure to make me understand that there isn't anything between them anymore, but just the fact that he introduced this girl in such an enthusiastic way (""I was crazy about this girl"", ""I did everything I could to get her"") and how the only reason they aren't together seems to be because they aren't in the same country and also, how he explained the reasoning of why nothing happened between them last time they met, makes me doubt that he doesn't have feelings for her anymore.I just feel like their relationship might still be in suspension/hanging and not going to lie, I've been feeling a bit jealous and insecure...?What do you think?   TL;DR! - Boyfriend talked about his ex very enthusiastically saying how he **was** crazy about her and that they broke up because they both went back to their country after their erasmus semester was over. Does he still have feelings for her?","If your boyfriend is still interested in his ""ex"", that may not be a bad thing. It can be nice to have someone in your life who remembers your past relationships and still cares about you. However, it might be helpful for him to talk to you about his feelings and why he's still attracted to his ""ex."" If you're interested in your boyfriend, it would be helpful to listen to what he has to say and offer support."

He has a son (age 3) who had a birthday recently. The guy I’m seeing (29M) told me he was going to go pick up his son and go to eat dinner for his birthday. I noticed that he picked up his son along with his ex (26F) and her children, and they all went out to eat together. Should I be concerned? He says it was nothing and it was just a birthday dinner, but I feel like it was an intimate dinner that didn’t really need to happen. I would be perfectly fine and not over thinking if they had went to a more child friendly place, but they went to outback steakhouse. In my opinion, it felt like they went out to eat together as a family, and I was just a nobody. He’s been a really good guy to me and actively pursuing me and trying to make things work with me but I’ve never been in a real relationship and I have trouble with over thinking.TL;DR- the guy I’m seeing (29M) went out to eat with his ex (baby mom) and her children, for their sons 3rd bday. They went to an adult restaurant, am I over reacting for thinking he’s wrong in doing this and not telling me he was going to?","Perhaps."

Okay so I(13FtM) have been dating my boyfriend (14FtBi-gender) for about a year 1/2 (give or take). As much as I love them, I also can't stand them. About a week ago they and I went to a roller skating rink, and we invited our friends, however the agreement was that they would stay the night Friday (the previous night) and go home Saturday night and of course, them being the pushy-ambitious type they begged if I could ask my guardian if they could stay another night and me being the type to follow I agreed (stupidly) everything was going fine until we were about to go to sleep and they tried to initiate something. I shut it down immediately. Unfortunately get very sex-repulsed. I suppose I should've told them but their mother is overly protective and never lets them them leave the house (besides school) so I never in a million years pictured us being in that situation.Fast forward to the next Monday. I tried avoiding them but it didn't work. I couldn't even look at them, that's how repulsed I am. It's currently Friday and I still can't even think of them without getting disgusted.So overall, do you think I should break up with them? Or is something that I might be able to get over?TL;DR : to chalk it up basically my partner tried to initiate intimacy, and I’m very sex repulsed so now I’m repulsed by them.","It is not appropriate to break up with someone over text message.

She struggles with her self image and has openly admitted in the past she struggles with seeking made Validation. Last night she took pictures that were in a low cut tube top and she sent them to me, she later tells me that she posted them and I go to look at there's one pic that has no face and only her chest with her hand on her boob, and also one where she is laying back in bed and the shirt is very low .she jokingly said it was to show of her nails. She also said ""they looked really good"" referring to her boobs. She has done this multiple times in the past and each time it makes me feel like I am not doing enough for her or making her feel pretty enough, but I also tell her if that's an issue than to please come to me and talk to me about it. Ultimately we just stopped arguing over the picture and I told her I'm not comfortable with it but it's her body and ultimately her choice. Today she sent me a screenshot of everyone who has liked the pic and ofc it included a few guys. She says that they only do it because they are trying to support ""like aww you look nice"" She asked why I care if she posts pictures like that because I am the only to get to see more than that, which is true but I feel like those type of pictures are only posted for one reason. I told her that I feel like her sexuality and my sexuality should be reserved for each other. This isn't me saying she shouldn't wear nice and revealing clothes outside, but I think that's very different than posting it. I know I can't control who looks at her and I'm not “shaming” her.l just don't understand the reason for it. I just want other people opinion. Thank youTLDR: my girlfriend keeps posting revealing photos of basically just her chest, and I am uncomfortable with it"," of herselfI know that some people enjoy seeing their partner's body in provocative poses and personally I don't mind if my girlfriend photographs herself in this way, as long as she is comfortable with it and I don't feel like she is using me to get attention from strangers.

They said they weren’t ready for a relationship, but sometimes we hug, they kiss me on the forehead/nose we compliment each other etc. They also say/do things that really feel romantic to me sometimes.However they go through these periods where they just don’t respond to me at all, they’re active on socials but they either leave me on seen or just don’t look at my texts. For more context, they’re neurodivergent and I understand it. But I don’t know whether or not they just don’t talk to me because they need a break from texting or if they just don’t want to talk to me at all. I know another person also has a crush on them and I’m just afraid that that’s the person they’re talking to instead of me. I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong because whenever we talk everything seems fine, but I feel like I might be doing something wrong to make them not want to hang out with me. I don’t really want to get too attached because we’re obviously not together, but I just need to know if my crush actually likes me like me or if they’re just talking to me because they feel bad or they feel like they have to so I can try to start getting over them. TL;DR basically, when we hang out they’re super nice and we kind of act like we’re “dating”. Sometimes they don’t talk to me though and I just want to know if they actually like me or not.","There is no definitive answer, as every person is different and therefore may have different preferences.

Sometimes you realize you don't like the person very much. But I'm scared when I start new relationships. I'm scared that at some point I'll stop trying. Little wounds will build up that will feel too big to fix and instead of leaving I'll just ""quiet-quit"". I'm scared that I'll stop trying to listen to them, type more than I read, criticise them for their faults and rarely acknowledge their strengths. I guess I've been in relationships before where I loved someone in the beginning so much only to feel annoyed whenever I saw their notifications pop up on my screen a year later. Speaking abrasively, dehumanizing them without the energy to view them newly.Maybe the more you get to know a person, the more they become part of yourself, the more you treat them like yourself. I ignore and dehumanize myself most of the time. It's getting better. I am changing. I'm starting a new relationship with someone I really like but our connection has already shown cracks in the past. We didn't particularly like eachother when we first met and he's hurt me in the past. Not majorly but enough to foreshadow issues in the future. We connect a lot. Our relationship improves as we get to know each other. We both make an effort for eachother and we've begun to improve as individuals because of eachother. It's not for a romantic purpose either, despite sort of liking eachother we have both agreed to be friends and just get to know eachother as people. But I'm scared that one day this will cease, especially if one day the challenge of trying to win eachother over is successful.tl;dr: does anyone share my concern? Do you have insight? I also have clinical anxiety disorders so I know there's a high chance I'm worrying excessively or might even fulfil my own prophecy. I want to leave this fear behind me or learn how to process it in a healthy way","1The end of a good relationship is usually when people stop trying to improve themselves for the sake of their partner. This usually means that they have lost interest in the relationship, or that the partner no longer cares about them."

She ghosted me for a few weeks and then hit me up one other time which i didn’t respond too. So we’ve had no communication basically for a month.Last week i see her at the bar for the first time in a month and i still said hi and was an adult about the situation. She starts talking to me and we were both drunk and had the talk about why she ghosted me and she could have just been straight up with me.She apologized and i forgave her bc we’ve been friends for 5 years and didn’t want to throw her out of my life. We ended up hooking up that night and i stayed over the next morning and we talked about various things for a few hours. felt like normal.On monday she texts me she wants to see me again and we text for a few hours and i got the invite to come over but then last minute she said she was too drunk and we can wait till Tuesday.. No problem i did don’t make a big deal about it.. Tuesday comes and she’s out with her friends and tells me i can come come over later. I said as long as you’re home by midnight we can. I text her at midnight seeing if she’s home yet and she doesn’t reply for 30 minutes and says “she’s so sorry and her phone died”. I was irked and went to bed but texted her back in the morning that it was no big deal. We haven’t talked the last 2 days but i texted her last night “are you still on your period” bc she mentioned she started on Monday and she just didn’t respond to that text?This was originally our fight in the first place bc of poor communication and she just does it a week later after i told her it bothered me.Am i overreacting here? i have too much pride to keep texting someone if i feel like i’m bothering them.TLDR: My Fwb and I ended a month ago bc of poor communication. I see her out last week and we talked it out and ended up having sex that night but this week she’s kind of starting it again. I don’t get her actions. Or am i just overthinking this whole thing and i shouldn’t expect a reply?","There is no one single answer to this question. It depends on the specifics of your relationship and the context of her actions. If her actions are causing you distress or are preventing you from fulfilling your responsibilities, it may be appropriate to speak with her about what she needs to do to improve the situation. If you feel like you are at fault, you may need to work on communicating your feelings more effectively."
"454","my boyfriend (23M) told me he feels he’s losing attraction to me (22F). Can i respark attraction over long distance?","we have been together for about 4 years now, 3 of those have been long distance. Because of the distance and our situation, we only see each other about 4-5 trips a year, at least a week or more each trip. other than that, we just text and call to fill the gap, but we are very good at having our own lives and just keep each other updated through it. he just told me that he feels like he’s struggling with his feelings of attraction towards me. this hit me really hard. lately i’ve been having a lot of body image issues because of weight gain i’ve had from a health issue. i’ve done a lot of work myself from changing my diet and activity and lifestyle to support weight loss, but because of my condition it is out of my hands for the time being. it has been VERY difficult to process that i don’t look the same that i used to AND that it is out of my hands. I noticed that because of these issues i’ve been having, im just so much more insecure than before. it’s hard for me to take pics of myself looking good (especially nudes) and send them because it’s hard for me to even look at myself right now. I feel like this is why his attraction is fading. when we’re together in person i’m totally fine, because i don’t have to see myself. he DIDNT say that it was the weight gain that has changed his attraction towards me, so maybe i’m just projecting my insecurities. My question is how can i try and re spark connection between us, even long distance? Is it even possible? Where do we go from here? TLDR: long distance boyfriend has said he is losing his attraction to me, is there anything i can do about that?","There is no surefire answer, but you may want to consider some things. First, it's possible that your boyfriend is simply getting a bit worn out – after being with you for a while, he may start to feel like he's seeing you more and more often, and that can take its toll. Alternatively, it could be that he's developed strong feelings for someone else and is no longer as interested in you. If you're both keen on continuing the relationship, it might be helpful to share your feelings and talk about what you need from each other to make it work. If you're both on the same page and everything is still not working out for you, you could consider moving on."
"455","My 26M Girlfriend 26F just told me about having HPV when I went to get checked for STD’s. Advice?","My 26M girlfriend 26F and I have been together for almost 15 months. We’ve had the talks about STD’s and whether each other are clean and this whole time she’s told me that she’s clean etc. Anyway, I’ve been having some weird symptoms so I decided to get a physical exam and get some blood work done for a panel of STD’s. Anyway, I expressed that I’m anxious to get the results and she mentions now that she had HPV when she was 19 but that it’s no big deal because it goes away. I immediately got mad because of the whole time we’ve been together and the times we have talked about STD’s this is the first time she’s told me that she has had HPV in the past. She told me she forgot and that it just now jogged her memory since I got tested and such. She says she wasn’t withholding information she just forgot to tell me - this whole time. I’m a bit irritated at this and I need advice. Thank you!TLDR; my GF just now told me that she has had HPV after I got screened for STD’s 15 months into our relationship"," HPV is a virus that can cause different types of cancer. Talk to your partner about the risks and benefits of getting HPV checked, and offer to do it together. You can also talk to your doctor or medical provider about the best way to protect yourself from HPV."
"456","Me (24 F) got cheated on by my (25 M) fiance and am now considering opening up the relationship after 6 years of being monogamous (aside from hischeating obviously)","Alright to make a long story short I got with my now partner when i was barely 18 and he was 19.  We immediately moved in together only after 3 months of dating.  I immediately developed a dependence on him but he was always so emotionally distant. Fast forward to last year I get pregnant and he's ecstatic.  He suddenly becomes my dream man so sweet and attentive.  I thought it was because I was pregnant but it was actually the guilt from cheating on me with a coworker.   After he admitted to cheating on me my world came crashing down.  Dday was november 23rd so still kind of recent.  We are now back to square one, the relationship has grown stale again and we both are depressed.  We love one another very much and now have a family.  For some reason however the only time I feel aroused is when thinking of his infidelity.  In fact after finding out although heartbroken I was more turned on then ever before in my life. I crave newness now too something I never even considered before. Everything just seems to be pointing towards opening our relationship up.  I seriously think it could improve our relationship and sex life. But I also don't know if maybe I'm just going through a crisis.   My self esteem hasn't been great since everything has happened and the only time I do feel attractive is when a man  tries to get my attention or compliments me as pathetic as that sounds this is also just as of recently. Should I talk to my partner about considering this?  Go to therapy first? I'm at a loss TLDR: After my fiance (M 25) cheated on me (F24) after 5 years together (total now 6)  I've been questioning rather or not I should ask for an open relationship.","It's tough to open up a relationship when it's been cheated on, but it's important to do what's best for you. Talk to your fiance about what you're feeling and see if he's willing to try and work things out. If he isn't willing to try, then it's best to end things."
"457","Why am I thinking about my ex so much now when I wasn't a month ago?","It's been 7 months since my ex (25F) and I (26M) broke up. The lady time we directly spoke to each other was in the beginning of January. Lately though  I've been thinking about her a lot and at random times catch myself thinking about her. Sometimes it's because I miss her and sometimes it's because I have a new thought process about why we ended or how things could've gone differently. I texted her last week telling her I missed her and wanted her back after a dream I woke up from that honestly felt like real life. Afterwards I texted again thanking her for not answering and that I would try my best not to bother her again. She texted me back saying that the time apart was good for her, that she didn't want to pursue a relationship with me anymore, and that u should move on. A large part of me wants to and is ready to move on but a piece of me still wants to hold out and wait for her. A friend told me that I could wait for her and still pursue other people and things. But I wonder if that's the best course of action. Is there any advice anyone can give me?TL;DR: Ex and I broke up several months ago, I've been thinking about her more lately than I have in previous months. Want to move on but also hold out and wait. Advice?","There could be a few reasons why you're thinking about your ex so much now. It could be that the circumstances that led to your breakup have recently changed and you're feeling nostalgic or emotional about the experience. It could also be that your relationship was relatively stable for a period of time, and now everything feels a little more unstable and uncertain. Finally, some people simply find it difficult to move on from a past relationship and tend to revisit it from time to time. In any case, it's important to talk to a therapist or counselor if you're experiencing persistent thoughts or feelings about your ex. Doing so can help you address any underlying issues and develop a healthier relationship with yourself."
"458","My (F24) BF (M25) and I are unhappy but he won't break up with me. What should I do?","Although I do love him, he can't make me happy. I can't seem to make him happy either. We have very different ideas of a relationship. I'm not a particularly clingy person, frankly I've dated much clingier people than myself, but I feel like a clinger compared to him. He's aloof and wants to be alone a lot. I feel rejected. Often he isn't affectionate, whereas I'm the type to enjoy cuddling while we sit together in private or watch TV. He says I'm too adolescent in this regard, I think I'm normal. It's not necessarily his fault, but I feel bad about myself in the relationship. I feel like a pest when he clearly doesn't want me around. He makes a lot of jokes about me being like a golden retriever. It hurts me a lot. I don't feel wanted. I worry something is deeply wrong with me. He says he's just mature or independent and I'll catch up. Some of his behaviour has bordered on verbally abusive at times. When he gets mad, he really gets mad. I irritate him so much. I have asked him why he hasn't dumped me/why he's still with me. We live together with several mutual friends and he doesn't want to live with an ex. And I refuse to move out. He doesn't want to see me with other men. He says he loves me multiple times a day, but I can't feel it. It's probably my fault.  I got drunk and starting crying today (I don't drink much) because i was so overwhelmed with the feeling of wanting to feel loved. It sounds so utterly stupid, but it really hurt that he spent St Patrick's Day with his female friend and I spent it with our mutual male friends. I tried to hide it but he seemed to care and insisted on leaving the bar and walking me home, despite my insisting I'd walk myself home and be ok. What should I do?TLDR: my BF and I are unhappy but he won't leave. What should I do?","There is nothing wrong with staying together despite being unhappy, but it may be helpful to discuss your concerns with your BF and see if there is anything you can do to make things more enjoyable for both of you. Maybe try counseling or therapy to work on your relationship issues. If you feel like you're just not good enough for your BF, it may be time toevaluate your worth and ask yourself if you're willing to put in the work to make things work. If you can't figure out a way to make things work, it may be time to consider breaking up."
"459","My [23F] best friend [23M] has been a little distant and I'm not sure if I should bring it up.","I've known him for a year now and in the beginning of our friendship we used to talk all the time but lately it's been less since he's very depressed and going through some changes such as finding a job and all that.Which I get and I haven't been pressuring him or anything. I voiced my concerns and he did make an effort but he's been having issues with his medication and bad ADHD and addiction so for the last week, he hasn't been texting me as often. He does apologize for it and tries to keep me updated which is why I was fine with it.However he told me he feels very bad, is tired, doesn't get out of bed and so on. And yesterday when I called him he told me he can't talk because he's about to play a game with someone.I told him no problem we can just do it tomorrow. He agreed and said he will if he's not playing with this one girl who he sort of has a crush on.I feel like all this time I've been worried about him and yet he's been making plans with other people. It makes me feel less important and that my company isn't that much of a priority.Or am I overreacting? TL; DR: Best friend has been less responsive and says he feels bad yet he's made plans with other people.","Since you are not sure if it's worth bringing up, you can either wait and see if your best friend becomes more communicative or you can try talking to them about what's going on."
"460","Should my partner (M22) and I (25F) be communicating issues verbally instead of over text?","When I’m upset about something I prefer to type out what I want to say. However, sometimes I can only let my partner, of nearly a year, know how I feel through text because I struggle to verbally express all that I’m feeling. My words get muddled and I forget things so I never feel like I’ve expressed myself fully. Over text, I can lay it out properly and revise it to make sure it is exactly what I want to say, and not too harsh or critical (mostly because I have a tendency to be a bit too blunt). We video call after (we’re long distance since July until May/June) to try and reconnect and discuss anything around it. So we do then have verbal communication and (distanced) face to face time. I guess I’m just worried that this will actually cause more disconnect in the long run. I’m also worried that if I don’t practice verbally expressing then I’ll never able to. He’s back in the country soon, so I’m worried about how I’ll deal with our issues that arise then. Will it be silly for me to still text even if we’re in the same house? Even if it helps me to express?Tl;dr: I express my feelings through text because I struggle to verbally articulate. Will this be a problem for our relationship? ***Edited for clarity.","From what you have said, it seems like you are communicating issues verbally instead of through text. This may be a problem because it allows for misunderstandings and can lead to tension. If the issues are serious, it may be better to talk about them face-to-face instead of communicating through text."
"461","how do i (20f) break up with my boyfriend (20m) and end things on a good note?","i’ve been in this relationship for about a year and a half and things are alright. i think we’re starting to look at different futures with each other that just don’t align. i also don’t know how to explain but i just don’t want to be in a relationship anymore. i’m working on my career and myself and i think he is very clingy and that’s just last thing i want right now. i was okay with that before i started my career but it’s starting to be distracting for me. i mention splitting up but he gets very upset with me because i can’t give a good reason since the relationship is going mostly good. he says that i can work and grow in my career in a relationship and we can figure out our futures together, so he doesn’t think my reasoning is valid i guess. he also says his reasoning for not wanting to break up is because we’re perfect for each other and he doesn’t think he’ll find anyone after me. he thinks we’re meant for each other. i don’t agree with that because we’re just 20 and there’s so many people out there.we have tried working things out, but it just goes back to where we started again. tldr: i just want to break up on good terms. he really is a good boyfriend, it’s just not what i want right now and i just want space.","There is no easy answer to this question, as things will vary depending on the specifics of your relationship. In general, though, you may want to try to have a conversation in which you openly discuss your feelings and consider your options. If breaking up is the best course of action for you, be honest about why you need to end things and make sure you are both understanding and supportive."
"462","Am I being unreasonable for disliking ex-gf's risque social media? How to handle in the future.","TL;DR I'm not sure if I was unreasonable about my expectations for ex gf and social media.I'm a 32m and I left my gf of 2 years 8 months ago because of her social media presence. It was mostly Instagram and tiktok and she wasn't doing anything that most people would consider cheating but I felt uncomfortable with it. I did know when I met her that she was very active on it but after a year in her posts got to the point where she was pretty much wearing nothing and while i was really proud of how good she looked, I also asked her if she'd be willing to save some of her body just for me. That was a firm no and we just couldn't make it work. I'm a successful, attractive guy and I thought I was respectful/reasonable.  Dating since the breakup has just been so much of the same though. I'm not dating anyone more than a 2-3 years younger and not even looking for a super specific type of look. Just someone I can laugh and have a conversation with without having to take a picture every hour and thinking about every guy that's going to be commenting on that photo. I had even told my ex that I'd love to take care of our expenses if she'd be willing to take less ""revealing"" jobs/posts or support her finding any other type of career but that was shot down too. Am I being ridiculous and backwards here? If I am what are appropriate boundaries for this kind of thing?","It's important to remember that we are all different and some people may enjoy social media that is risque or provocative. However, if you do not enjoy this type of content, it may be best to stay away. If you do not feel like your ex-gf is being respectful of your feelings, you may want to talk to her about it. You can tell her that you are uncomfortable with her posts and ask her to stop. If she does not listen, you can choose to unfriend her or block her from seeing your posts."
"463","27f 31m How do I approach this topic of differences in our background and him being a mentor?","This guy (31m) and I (27f) have been seeing each other for 2 months in person and with him being away for 3 months, he’ll be returning home soon.No, we’re not boyfriend/girlfriend.To give context, Bill (let’s call him that) comes from a vast different background than me ( more travel, more opportunities all that) and although he had a moment  In his life where he was at his lowest, he picked himself up and doing well for himself financially and all that. I, (27f) on the other hand, have come from more of a sheltered small town background  and still am flailing. I’m more greyed out as a person and naive about the world, people.I don’t feel jealous of him but at times I worry he thinks I’m bland and well not enough. Or worse, he pities me. When it gets to topics of travel or things he done, I go mute because I don’t know what to say. I think he tries to downplay them or not mention his experiences at all. He’s a really sweet, good guy. I fear I’m being a burden on him because of my background and the fact I make less money than him (my salary would be considered working poor) and he’s in tech.I worry if we go into a relationship he’s going tom feel disdain with how much I make bc it limits what we can do or make him feel like he has to constantly treat me. It’s not like Im not trying hard to be better but can I keep up?In my past relationships or interactions I feel like I’ve always been more the mentee and the other guy is a mentor because he’s more experienced in those things,ie waysof the world.Tl:dr: Dating a guy who comes from a very different background than me where there were more opportunists and makes more money than me. It’s been weigh heavily on my mind, I’m the sense of how much  it affect us being together. Not sure if I should even bring my worries up or keep them to myself.","There are a few things that you can do in order to approach this topic. First, you can talk to him about how you feel about the differences in your backgrounds. He may be able to teach you a lot about the struggles that he went through and how he was able to overcome them. Additionally, you can ask him about his experiences as a mentor and how he approaches helping others. He may be able to give you some great advice on how to be a better mentor yourself."
"464","Does his G/F deserve to know she was cheated on?","**TLDR:** Had a passionate holiday romance with someone I later found out had a girlfriend. Does she deserve to know?I (35F) met a guy (36M) I thought was amazing whilst on holiday recently and we had a whirlwind passionate romance lasting 3+ weeks. We both live in separate countries, and so deep down I knew it was likely to just be short lived. Nevertheless, we had this ridiculous connection and chemistry and so I got the feels a bit. On our last night together I asked him about staying in touch and he was like ""no, it's not realistic with the distance"". He had previously told me he had been single for many years but was happy, but mentioned in passing a girl who popped up every six months and who he went on some dates with.At the time I was a bit sad that he didn't want to stay in touch. Whilst the distance thing is valid, I felt like our life situations are such that we could have stayed in touch had we wanted to, and so it was more likely that he just didn't like me enough to want to stay in touch. He sent me a bunch of messages once we were both home but eventually he stopped making first contact so much, and then I decided it was time to move on and I did my best to put it behind me, stopping contacting him etc.But I've now learned through mutual acquaintances that this ""once every six months girl"" is actually a long term girlfriend he's been with for years who is away a lot because she's recently started studying. In some respects it was good to know he didn't reject me for me, but because he actually had another relationship that he didn't let on about. But I also feel annoyed he lied to / misled me. I also feel for this girl. I'm not 100% certain, but pretty sure for various reasons that they don't have any kind of open relationship or ENM situation.Deep down I am pretty sure the best option is to say nothing to her. It's not my place. Just because I'm annoyed by being lied to/ misled doesn't mean she should be hurt. What happens on holiday stays on holiday etc etc. But I'm looking for advice. If you were the girl, would you want to know?**0 CommentsShareSave**","There is no definitive answer, as it ultimately depends on the situation. If the woman was the one who cheated, then it may or may not be wise for her to tell her G/F. If the G/F was the one who cheated, then it may or may not be wise for her to tell the man."
"465","[31f][30m] kind of wondering why boyfriend always has said that he loves me more when in reality he doesnt","If someone can maybe shed some light here for me...To be honest. Me and him are not equally yoked.He does love me. I know it. But he does not necessarily like me.He has told me my needs do not matter to him. And I see and understand now that is why I always have to ask for my needs to get met.He sees my needs are something that are not important.. my needs are: dates planned, flowers... small gifts.. I do everything above and go beyond. I realized I need to either just take a step back and not put so much effort into him or I need to leave.I am pregnant btw. And accidentally got pregnant. When I was to finally leave and make my decision that's when I found out.I've decided to own up on my shit. I don't feel I need to explain further on this subject.My thing is I'm wondering why a man what it seems like to me give me these promises only to hold me back because it seems like he doesn't want another man to have me.. say these things only to believe the above.As he says he's investing on our future like house, a ring etc..Yet, he's not planned one date, he talks about getting his mom and grandma out of working yet his unborn doesn't even have a damn crib yet. I still live in an apartment?? Lol His dad's dying wish was for my boyfriend to take care of family... yet neglecting the one he created one with.I know I need to leave but I'm held back with scare tactics from both therapist and boyfriend. They both mention how hard it's going to be raising a baby on my own.Yet that doesn't stop dad and or his families help. Tl;DR: Wondering why a man says one thing and treats me another. I don't feel we are equally yoked. I have tried breaking things off before but because of low self worth/ esteem I stayed and ended up pregnant and keeping it. Do I stay or go. It's been a constant battle of on the fence. I want to go be happy else where. I'd probably be more happy alone.I already know people don't take single mothers serious... not sure. What do you think of all of this? Thanks for the help","This could mean a few different things. It could be that the boyfriend really does love you more than you think, or that he just doesn't want to hurt your feelings. It could also mean that he's been told to say those things by someone else, or that he's just insecure. You might want to talk to him about why he thinks he needs to say those things, and see if there's a way to move past this issue."
"466","My girlfriend (19F) was seeing other people while talking to me (23M)","tl:dr - Girlfriend hooked up with co-worker several times while we were talking and after she was inviting me over for movies (before we got together); I don't know how to feel or proceed.   This post might seem really trivial compared to most other posts on here, but I'm going through a lot of emotions right now and I'm not entirely sure how to feel, so I'm hoping to get some insight from others.&#x200B;My girlfriend and I started dating beginning of February, but have known each other since November of 2021 and both started to develop feelings for each other in April of 2022. We're both in a college town together, so we both went home for the summer between school years and didn't talk much despite our feelings for each other (unknown to each other). &#x200B;We started talking more and more in October of 2022, then at the beginning of December she invited me over to watch a movie with her a couple times but I unfortunately had to decline due to work commitments (I likely would've turned down the offer anyways as I am shy and was too much of a chicken to go over knowing what might happen lol)&#x200B;Finally at the beginning of February, she invited me over for a movie again and I accepted. Couple nights over there, and we ended up starting a relationship.&#x200B;We've both been very open about past partners etc. However, she recently talked about a co-worker from her summer job that she hooked up twice with in late December, after she had invited me over for movies and was talking to me on a daily basis.&#x200B;Like I said before, this might sound really trivial but I'm a bit torn on this whole thing, that she went and hooked up with a former (and future this summer) co-worker while she was trying to start a relationship with me. And fwiw, she had 3 other hookups in October/November while we were talking and interested in each other.&#x200B;Is this something I should be concerned about? How should I proceed going forward?","Your girlfriend may be seeing other people while talking to you, or she may be upset with you and not want to talk to you.

"467","My partner is frequently overwhelmed and I don't know how to help","Apologies for the word vomitMy GF (27; AuDHD) and I (29; OCD) have been going through a lot recently that has been built up over about several years of us being together which largely stems from me not supporting her while she really needed me and she then blamed herself/made excuses for me not supporting her. After broaching these feelings with me several months ago, I've been extremely unsure on what to do/how to help because acknowledging/expressing emotions are so foreign to me - that being said, they are equally foreign to her, except she had the strength to bring it up with me, whereas I still really struggle with emotions/feelings and empathising with her.She is constantly overwhelmed with her job, her family, her health, and me all triggering her. For me being so dismissive of emotions/feelings and finding it so hard to empathise and offer useful support I ask often a lot of questions to get a picture of the situation (primarily offer a solution, rather than comfort); if I don't ask, then I don't understand? But, the relentless question asking is also triggering for her (or the relentless asking of the wrong questions), and after several years of living together, she's sick of giving me instructions on what to do for her/to help her and answers to how she feels for example.She is so fucking tired of carrying all the incredible amount of trauma and stress and strain of her life that she doesn't have the energy to carry mine as well and tell me what to do to help her, because even if she does and I do it, that's not genuine.So, I'm at a crossroads. I still don't understand what to do/how to help in so many situations and I feel like if I ask, then that's going to make her feel worse and more triggered and more upset. But if I don't ask and just do something (or nothing..) that I don't *know* will work, and it doesn't, then isn't that worse? <-- The inner dilemma that goes through my mind every day. I'm going to therapy to try to dissect that and understand why I'm like this, which is very helpful, but I need to DO something. I have zero actions because I don't know what to do or how to do it or when to do it.TL;DR I'm an extremely emotionally dismissive person with severe issues with empathy and compassion for my GF struggling with her trauma/stress/anxiety/mental health. I can't sit on the sidelines telling her that I'm learning about X, but then doing fucking nothing while she collapses in from the weight of her trauma and stress. I LOVE HER SO MUCH, but I overthink everything and just don't know how to help and I feel so fucking awful.","One possible solution is to communicate with your partner about how you're feeling and offer support. Other possible solutions include seeking professional help or mediation."
"468","BF lied for 6 months about seeing another woman, should I let it go?","Alright. So me (19 f) and my bf (20 m) have been dating for close to 3 years. We have had our fair share of issues as any relationship does. But in October of last year, we decided to go on a break because we were having some major issues that arose from his dealing with legal matters. He was very stressed out, and naturally, I wanted to be there for him and offer any support that I could. Throughout the break, we were still in contact occasionally, and I asked him often about the situation but at some point, he stopped sharing the details with me and said that I couldn't understand what he was going through. He began to act very secretively, whereas before we shared everything with each other. After finally realizing I should just give him space, I stopped asking. I'm a college student and I felt I should just focus on my studies. From there, his legal problems were resolved and honestly had the best possible outcome. We began talking again and got back together. Fast forward to about a week ago, he finally admitted to me that during that break he had slept with another woman. He says he knows this woman from the past. She got a boyfriend soon after they had sex so it was a short-lived situation. I was absolutely crushed and still am. We talked about it, his story is that she made the first move, and he never intended for it to go there and that it was a very unfulfilling experience. My main concern was the fact that he lied for so long about it. To date, he still has no explanation for lying for so long. He has promised to be better and to cut out the lying behavior. It seemed genuine, but I could just be blinded because I'm still very much in love with him. It just really hurts that he could lie for that long. It makes me question my worth and the last 6 months of this relationship as a whole. So, my main question is, should I attempt to continue this relationship and rebuild trust?&#x200B;TLDR; My boyfriend slept with another woman during our break 6 months ago and lied about it until now. What should my next move be?","The decision to let something go is difficult. You may feel that you have forgiven the person, but it may still be weighing on your mind. If you are still worried about the situation, it is best to talk to someone about it. There may be resources available to you, such as a therapist or counselling."
"469","How do I go about a weirdo teacher?","I don’t know where to post this and this seemed like the most fitting subreddit, I apologize in advance if it’s not the right oneMy boyfriend is in 12th grade. He’s 17 and he lives about 2 hours away from me with train. After 10th grade he moved schools because the education system here in Germany is in stages and he decided to further his education beyond 10th grade.In his old school he had a teacher who has made advanced towards him after he graduated from there and since the whole class meets up a few times a year, he told me that during a party where they all met with said teacher there. Like I mentioned, that teacher had been making advances towards him and sending him nudes, with my boyfriend reacting positively to that back then.At the party the teacher approached him and it lead to my boyfriend sucking the teacher off. After that night the teacher was texting him stuff like “we should meet up again and do more things”.I find it sickening to my stomach and although he was no longer a student I do think this is an abuse of his power and authority. As far as I know the teacher is 39, I found that out after doing some digging.Said teacher is also responsible for the job orientation at the school and is a coach for table tennis outside of school for boys under 19.My boyfriend doesn’t want to do anything against him, I presume because he doesn’t want to be in trouble and doesn’t want others to find out. I want that teacher stripped away from his positions and honestly for him to suffer. I need to find a way to make it happen without that leading to my boyfriend and I would appreciate your advice.TLDR: A teacher from my boyfriend’s old school is a creep that doesn’t deserve to be in his position and I need to know what to do about it","There is no one easy answer to this question. It may involve talking to your parents or guardians, observing the teacher in class, or simply speaking to other students who have had a positive experience with the teacher."
"470","I’m worried by boyfriend finds me too clingy","I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (22) for 3 months and it’s been great. I stay at his a few nights a week but recently it’s been always me initiating it, and he makes jokes that he’s getting sick of me. My mental health recently hasn’t been great, I’m in the process of getting help for anxiety. The only time I truly feel better is when I’m with him but he doesn’t seem to understand how much he means to me because he’s so laid back. I have to ask him to text me and otherwise he just lets me do everything. He’s also going to work abroad in May and the thought of having a LDR really stresses me out. Yesterday he told me he’s going away for the weekend even though we’d kind of made plans and I just started crying uncontrollably because I was really looking forward to going out together. He couldn’t see why I was so upset so I texted him this morning explaining that I want to make the most of the time we had left together and he just replied with “ok”. I know we love each other and when we’re together he’s obsessed with me too, but he’s so terrible at making plans when we’re apart that I’m worried he finds me too needy. Should I try and explain again why it makes me upset that he doesn’t put in as much effort, or just accept it and assume that everything is good on his end unless he tells me otherwise?Tl:dr - I’m always imitating things with my boyfriend and I’m worried he’s going to resent me","If your boyfriend finds you too clingy, it may be a sign that you're not really interested in him. He may feel like you're not giving him enough space, and he may start to feel like you're not really interested in him."
"471","How to plan the perfect bday for my bf?","Hi there! So, I have been studying abroad for the last months and even had to extend my stay. My bf has been nothing but supportive even though he’s going through a tough time and has to stay alone in our beautiful apartment. His father died and he was an a*hole but now my bf has to deal with all this shit and I can’t be there with him. He doesn’t talk much which makes everything a bit more difficult. That’s why, when I visit him for his bday in 2 weeks, I want it to be the perfect day for him. I was thinking about starting the day let’s say physically pleasing, preparing a cozy breakfast and ordering flowers. Maybe bake a cake?Anyway, I was thinking that maybe you guys have more ideas on how to treat him like the fucking gem he is. I want to show him I’m thankful and I want to see him smile, possibly the whole day through. So, what would make your day the best?A little more info on him: he’s the smartest guy I know, finishing his masters degree in astrophysics. He’s turning 26, loves movies and South Park, rides a motorcycle and is a little autistic in a very silent, sceptical and not very affectionate way which is why I absolutely don’t want to fail with this.Any tips and ideas are welcome, thank you in advance!TL;DR: I want to plan the perfect bday for my lovely but silent bf who’s been very supportive while I’m studying abroad but is going through a tough time himself. Thanks for tips and ideas!","There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the perfect birthday gift for your boyfriend may vary depending on his interests and personality.

"472","I'm ashamed to say I (29F) am tempted to break up my friends(30F) marriage to her husband (30M)","Me and this girl met when we were about 24, we worked together, lived on site and really connected. I knew her current boyfriend was her high-school sweetheart they'd been together 7 yrs at the time. I told her all about how I felt before we parted ways, but I'm not a homewrecker. I just believed she was trapped in that relationship. Nothing ever happened and we have kept in touch occasionally. They got married 2 yrs ago and I remember seeing that and my heartbreaking. Now(we haven't seen each other in 5 years) out of the blue she asks if I'll visit her. I went for the weekend with the intent of answering what seemed a call for help, not to split them up. I was nice to her husband and not falsely, he's a nice enough guy. But I can't help it, I'm still in love with her. This post is half cathartic confession but here's my question: Why would a married woman contact another woman she knows had feelings for her in the past? Is this her being careless about the awkward situation or is it an intentional obstacle she wanted to bring up? I must ask because the variable of being gay brings confusion. If I was a dude that used to love her I can't imagine being invited to their house for the weekend. I don't relish being able to fly below hetero radar BTW, but I made use of that double standard to make a friend happy with a visit.TL;DR I think ""the one that got away"" wants to leave her husband to be with me, another woman. What, if anything, should I do?","If you are tempted to break up your friends' marriage, first recognize that this is a very difficult decision to make. It's natural to feel upset and sad when you think about your friends hurting, but doing anything to interfere with their relationship is not fair or healthy. If you can, try to find a way to talk to your friends about your concerns and persuasion them to stay together. If that doesn't work, then consider speaking to a therapist or counselor about your feelings."

It was something I knew I needed and wanted to do, in order to grow personally. I loved ( and still do in ways) him, as a person, I loved the companionship. But it was just not for me and I had known for so long, between the age difference and his lack of ambition to do more in his life, among many other things... I knew I had to make that change, but the pain I feel myself for hurting him still weighs heavy. It is hard not to remember that there were so many good times, as much as there were awful times and for a good portion of the first 5 years i was treated terribly. I feel like i blindsided him, and its hard to forgive myself. I don't want to go backwards, and I don't want the life I had before back. But I am wondering if anyone has been in this position before?TL;DR why do I feel do much guilt for choosing myself, and why even over a year later do I still get overcome with emotions and sadness over it at times?

She wanted me to move down to her, I didn't feel ready/got cold feet, we talked l, and we both determined that while we loved each other, our future long term goals just didn't match. She wanted to move and settle on the west coast while I wanted stay on the east coast near my family. Despite our break-up, we managed to repair and remain friends, which leads me to my conundrum. When we initially broke up, I had been offered a job in her city, as I had been looking ao I could move to her. After turning it down citing issues moving, they counter offered me and allowed me to work remotely. Now, I feel more ready to move to the city that my job is in and where my ex/friend is. The issue is, I'm kind of afraid to tell her. Me not moving was part of the reason we broke up in the first place, and I'm afraid that it will fully destroy our relationship if I decide to move and she feels betrayed. But I wanted to move then(just got too nervous) and want to move now. Does anyone have any advice how I should approach this?

But last week she did something that really pissed me off. I won’t get into the details because the context of the situation is too complicated to explain online. But basically I’ve been annoyed and she doesn’t even know that I am and i haven’t cancelled yet. I’ve been putting it off because a part of me feels like it might be a good idea to bring it up to her face to face. And I’m not sure how soon the next opportunity to see her in person will be, if I don’t go this weekend. Which would mean if I don’t see her & have a convo with her this weekend, i could be holding onto this for a while. Unless I did it over the phone or texted her. But at the same time I’m not sure if anything would be resolved if i did have that convo with her. and if it goes badly it would ruin the weekend for our other friends and just be awkward. And my issue with her is kind of a longstanding problem about her taking me for granted and being inconsiderate so distancing myself might be good for me. So yeah I can’t decide if any good would come out of going with my other friends to visit her or if it’s a bad idea. How should I go about resolving this situation with her?TL;DR: made plans a while back to visit a friend this weekend with other friends. but she did something that pissed me off last week. and ive been putting off cancelling because i feel like it might be a good idea to see her face to face to work it out. but that also could end badly and distancing myself from her might be the way to go since this issue i have with her is a long-standing issue of her taking me for granted & being inconsiderate. so im not sure what to do","You may want to reach out to your friend to see if they are available to go out this weekend.

"477","I [25 M] am having a dating quandary.","For the last 6 years of my dating life I have dated with very little thought or preference to religion. I’ve always held the opinion that, as long as my partner let me practice my faith it wouldn’t be an issue. I’ve had quality relationships but continually seem to meet people not ready for long-term commitment (I’ve been either an undergrad or grad student that whole time and dated mostly other students). I’ve been getting frustrated with the apparent lack of commitment and generally just the dating pool. A close friend of mine suggested I start to date Catholic girls more purposefully. Honestly the early returns have been great. They generally share similar values and are more ready for the long-term commitment I’m looking for.However, there has appeared a quandary. Many of these girls are more guarded in respect to sex. I have some kinks that I want a significant other to be open to. But for many of the girls I’ve dated talking about any sex itself is almost taboo. It definitely makes me concerned that my kink won’t be accepted. Which leads me to my quandary. Do I return to dating a more general pool (that has been more accepting of my kink and easier to talk about sex with)? Or do continue dating the Catholic girls and hope one of them will just be more accepting? I’m really interested in what you would do with this same problem?Tl;dr: Do I return to dating a more general pool (that has been more accepting of my kink and easier to talk about sex with)?

One of my friend invited us both to hers for a few drinks and then to go out to a bar then a club. I thought it would be a good chance for my bf to meet my friends so I mentioned it to him and he was excited. He can be quite socially anxious and shy/quiet in groups and especially meeting new people. When we get to my friends, there's me, my bf and 2 of my friends. My friend and I start catching up and she's talking about mutual friends and I try explaining to my bf who the people are that are being mentioned so he can keep up with the conversation and feel involved. My other friend spoke to my bf for a bit, asking him questions and being friendly and it looked like he was more comfortable. The friend I was catching up with didn't seem to talk to my bf a lot and mainly spoke to me then we went out to the bar and club and after about an hour my bf wanted to leave. I could see he was annoyed or upset so we left. The next morning I asked him what was wrong and he said he felt like an outsider all night and that every time he attempted to make conversation with my friend, she's either give him a one word answer or change the topic of conversation to yet another person he didn't know.

"479","My (31F) boyfriend (33M) has been getting on to me about my finances, when I’ve told him I’m on top of everything. How do I get him off my back?","This happened two days ago and my boyfriend and I have been arguing about it since:I work in homeless services, and lately one of my clients has been carrying his belongings in a garbage bag. I had this really nice northface back that I got a few years ago, but didn’t really use it. I wanted to give this backpack to my client so he could comfortably carry his things in. I was sharing this with my boyfriend and he was more concerned that I just gave away a really nice (and expensive) backpack when I could have sold it instead. I explained to him that I got it years ago, didn’t end up liking it after using for a while, and I also got it with a gift card so it’s not like I actually used my money. He thinks I just throw money away by giving away things I don’t want anymore.For example (these are examples he gave), when he lost his AirPods, I gave him my old pair. These shirts that I thrifted 10 years ago, I gave them to him because they were more his style than mine anyway. He just thinks I just throw away money. I also like really nice things like jewelry, purses, and nice clothes. I don’t really spend a lot of money all the time, but sometimes I like to spoil myself every now and then with the money I earned for all the hard work I do at work. His biggest concern is that I (we both do, but I have more in student debt) and we both pay off our student loans and then when they are paid off, we can spend money on whatever I want. That sounds really nice, but I’m probably going to be paying off my loans for the next 30-40 years, maybe 50, or until I’m off this earth, regardless, I don’t want to stress myself out, and literally just be working to pay them off. I’m on top of my loans, and my bills every month, and still have money left over. I don’t always spend it, but again, if I see something I like and it’s not going to put me in a financial bind, I might get it. He would rather spend money on experiences, rather than materialistic things, and he thinks I’m being materialistic when I don’t believe I am. This whole argument has made me feel like I did the wrong thing and questioning if I am in the wrong about everything and am hoping to hear others perspective.TLDR: my boyfriend won’t get off my back about how I spend my money.","Well, it sounds like your boyfriend is concerned about your financial security and is trying to help out in any way he can.

His work opportunities are far better here than in our home country, and he earns a much higher salary than he would at home. One issue we have been having is I would eventually like to move back to our home country, for the sole reason of being closer to my family. I’m very close with my family and love them more than anything. He on the other hand doesn’t share the same close relationship with his family, and thinks parents should “let their kids fly away”. He also doesn’t like to have a detailed plan for his future, and just wants to “see what happens” rather than having a rigid plan in life. I’m not a meticulous planner, but I do like to have an idea of where my life is heading and if we share the same goals.I love the city and country we moved to, and could definitely see myself here long term if it weren’t for my family back home. He doesn’t want to move back home anytime soon because of the job opportunities here, and I would feel guilty making him move back to our home country just so I could be near my family, if it was not something he truly wanted and just did to make me happy.  I love him so much and see a future with him, and he loves me too and would like us to get married one day, but this is one big thing that I am struggling with. Is there any sort of compromise that can be made? Have any of you been in a similar position and have any advice? Thank you.TL;DR: I want to one day move back to our home country to be near my family, and my boyfriend is less keen to move back due to better job opportunities where we are. How can we make it work?"," We have been together for 3 years and this is the first time we have been in this situation.There are many factors that go into deciding where to live, and it is impossible for one person to have all the answers. It is important that both you and your boyfriend weigh yourselves down with as many considerations as possible before making a decision.Some factors to consider include your budget, your work and school schedule, your lifestyle preferences, and your community. It is also important to consider your relationship with your neighbors, as well as the availability of schools and employment. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to make the decision that is best for them. If you and your boyfriend can't come to a consensus, then it might be best to stay put for now and chat about your options further down the line."
"482","When I (m30) feel it may be worth asking an ex (f26) out again in the far future","After a long term relationship went south I committed a classic error and rushed into a heated relationship with a friend I quite liked ie We had sex at my place before my long term ex had moved out! As we got to know each other, it became clear I wasn’t presenting my best or true self, and she was becoming less interested. We had a few talks that left the state of our situation tenuous at best. In December she suggested the feelings might not be there because she couldn’t trust me to be be over my ex so quickly. In January, I suggested we breakup, which she then asked to hold off on, before two later saying “I can’t continue with a romantic relationship with you right now”. Rhetorical argument aside, I read between the lines to remove the ambiguity. She wants to be done.We were both mentally prepared to breakup back in December.Each time she brought up that she was shocked that I could think I was capable of being in a relationship so close to my previous one. Because I was worried of losing my shot at being with her, I denied it even though I now truly know she was right.In this moment of finally being single, I feel myself changing. I’ve begun crying, not about my most recent ex, but over my long term ex. The only time I really think about my most recent relationship (we’re still friends) it’s the general feeling of loneliness.I’m clearly not healed and I feel terrible for both of us. I don’t know how long or who I will be at the end of this change but the current me is wondering if I still have feelings for her should I suggest we try again.TLDR: Got off on the wrong foot due to rushing things and not being genuine. Can time apart give us a second chance?","It depends on our relationship at that point in time, and whether or not we think our relationship could be improved. If we have strong sentimental feelings for each other and think our relationship could be salvaged, then it might be worth asking. If, on the other hand, our relationship is currently troubled or we have had difficulty communicating, it may not be worth the investment."
"483","(F30) Ending a friendship (M37) over poorly timed text message?","I (F30) have a friend (M37) who I’ve known for about six months. We meet up maybe every 3 weeks or so to grab food or go for a walk. I wouldn’t describe us as close but we have some things in common and I enjoy his company. A couple months ago, my mom was rushed to the hospital and needed emergency surgery. Needless to say, it was one of the worst and scariest weeks of my life. I took a few days of work to stay with her at the hospital and was her primary caregiver after she was discharged. My friend (M37) saw me post about it on social media and wished her a successful recovery, which I appreciated. Everything started on a Monday. On Friday, I finally had some space to catch my breath and do some self-care. I went for a walk and signed up for a yoga class, which was a big deal because my family had been in crisis mode all week. During my walk, my friend texted me asking how my mom was doing. I didn’t have the capacity to respond in that moment, but appreciated the gesture and kept walking. Then, about 30 minutes later, he texted again. He said something I said when we last hungout (about a week prior) had made him “uncomfortable” and he wanted to jump on the phone and talk about it when I had a moment. The message itself is fine… I was just in disbelief that he thought that right then was an appropriate time to send it. I was also a little confused because our conversations tend to be somewhat neutral. We talked about work, hobbies, and books, which feel like fairly safe topics. Anyways, I told him that I wasn’t in a state to respond right then, but I’d get back to him when everything calmed down. Some time has passed now and now “the talk” is still hanging over my head. But I can’t help but feel totally turned off and demotivated about our friendship. I feel like when there is a family emergency, a true friend would show up to be supportive, not redirect the focus back to themselves. TL;DR- Friend (M37) wanted to confront me during a family emergency. I’ve (F30) lost motivation to continue the friendship and want to know if I’m being too harsh.","I would end my friendship with someone if we had a poorly timed text message that led to a fight."

In a networking drink, I (24F) noticed a guy (32M) eyeing me all evening, so I came by for hellos. We talked briefly, and before he left he asked to exchange numbers.In the following weeks we gradually grew closer, from a casual cafe chat to weekly and then daily meme exchanges. After 3 weeks, we finally had our first date partying together with his friends, and first kiss. A week after: first overnight stay. NYE, he brought me to dinner with his parents, and partying with his friends, and he sent pics with me to a dozen of his friends and biz connections. All was great.After that we were apart for a month because I visited my parents in another city. But we texted daily, flirting and all. He flew there (city I was in) for a biz thing, and we partied with more friends of his. Then a week after that, I flew back to the city we both are based in, mostly to be near him (because I can afford to work from anywhere). When I communicated this move and the reason, he was happy. After I landed, we were closer than ever before. Seeing each other every day for 3 days, in many contexts (airport pickup, work together at home, chilling at friend's). Not all my asking. And then, we stopped seeing each other. It started with 3 days without texts from him, and when I asked, he cited ""busy"". Then more days without any other communications from him except his occasional complaints about work. I tried to make the chat box alive for a week with memes or a simple ""are things alright"", but finally couldn't take it anymore and asked for a meal together. He didn't read my texts.Another week, I asked him to be straightforward and tell me if he's no longer interested, because we might bump into each other so ghosting would cause awkwardness. He still said ""hectic weeks"". So I sent over a long text saying: I wish him lucks, but I am not happy with the 0 comms, and in the future when he has capacity and interest again, ping me. He hasn't read that text.Weeks later I see pics of him flying to another city, or hanging out with friends, etc. And I feel like a fool for being ghosted.Now, I trust that he was busy for real (his sister, when bumped into me, also said so). And maybe he's still busy. However, I am confused by this level of... disrespect? Is there any other logical/cultural ways to explain such behaviours?tl;dr: we were seeing each other, I felt our bond was growing, he brought me to friends', parents', and suddenly he ghosted me. Any explanation?","M32 could have been confused after bringing you to your parents' and ghosting you. He may have been overwhelmed by the new situation and confused as to what to do next.

"485","Recently started dating but having second thoughts","I (21M) recently starting seeing a girl (20F) and we talked and made it official a couple weeks ago, and I absolutely adore her. She’s sweet, funny, attractive and I love being with her. At first, I was confident in saying yes to dating but am having second thoughts and I feel terrible about it.The last two years have been very centered in trying to improve my confidence, self esteem etc. after a bad breakup. Part of my desire to improve came from my lack of ability to flirt, which sounds really stupid, but I’ve always been extremely socially awkward so getting better was a big part for me. In the months leading up to meeting this girl I’d been talking to a few different people and was having a lot of fun finally being able to comfortably talk to girls and people in general. It was like I had discovered a new ability and wanted to play around with it a little bit, which sounds so incredibly douchey, but my social anxiety had always prevented me from even thinking about talking to someone.After we started dating, I felt like I had spent so long been working up this ability to finally have fun flirting with people, only to put it to rest a few weeks after finding success. I’m totally obsessed with this girl and would never be unfaithful, but still have this desire to “test out” my ability to talk and flirt with people. I feel like an asshole for even thinking this way, but I know it’s not fair to either of us. Does anyone have any tips on how to confront this feeling?TLDR; started dating a girl and I really like her, but feel like I’m not ready to stop talking to other people after spending so much time trying to improve my confidence with flirting.","It's tough to know when something is right. You may have started dating someone and it's been great, but maybe you've been thinking about other people and you're not sure if this is the right thing for you. It's important to talk to your partner about what you're feeling, and see if they can help you figure out if this is something you want to continue. If you decide that this is not for you, you can end the relationship gracefully."
"486","i (25F) told my partner (22F) that someone has a crush on me and they got upset","Someone close to me, recently told me that some random person from a party has a crush on me.I’ve been in a relationship with my partner for a few years. They were also at the party that night, and it was pretty clear we were together and mostly everyone at the party knew we were together. I’d never met this person before but I guess they formed a crush? I didn’t even talk to them, like I said hi when someone introduced us but other than that I didn’t even go near them the rest of the night. Anyway, someone I knew told me about it and I laughed and said that was funny. I didn’t think much of it because it’s likely I’ll never see this person again and I’m literally in a long term committed relationship and love my partner.So I showed my partner the conversation and they got upset about it. Said the person was disrespectful for even talking about it, and saying the person who told me didn’t respect her or our relationship. And that I reacted badly and shouldn’t be laughing about it.I don’t know, I thought it was just like a harmless funny thing? I also didn’t wanna keep it from them. How should I go about this?

If your partner feels like they can't trust you or that you're not being honest with them, it can be difficult to build a healthy relationship. It might be best to talk to your partner about what's going on and see if they can come up with a way to deal with the situation."
"487","help with this issue at hand","Hello, this is my first time posting here.Little bit of background,A few months ago, my (15M) girlfriend (15F) cheated on me, and I was devastated. It shattered me, and I was a wreck, even though I haven't even graduated high school yet. We had been dating for a little over a year, and it really did suck when I found out. Though throughout this time healing period, there was this one girl (15F) who will be referred to as ""C"" from now on. During this period after i found out C had always been there for me and when I needed it I'd just text her and she'd help, now after I've been healed and all if those memories are in a box stuffed in the back of my closet, I realized that I saw C as more than a friend. I feel she is one of the only people I can open up too, she has beautiful blue eyes, her smile is just enough to make anyone happy, and her hair is gorgeous, she  gives me butterflies in my stomach when ever i talk to her, she is the most caring person in the world, and even loves similar things i love to do (ex. Play video games, listen to the same genre of music, etc) Though there are a couple of ""bumps in the road,"" the first being that she is ""talking"" to someone already which I thought after meeting him I would stop loving her, usually after the fact with past crushes I would just stop then and there though only this time it didn't work, I still loved her. The other ""bump"" is the reason she is not dating this guy she's talking too, she was in a very bad relationship last time she was in one, she says she's not ready to date again yet until she finishes fighting her own demons. And now I'm off for spring break and have plans to hang out next week, should I tell her how I feel or should I wait and hope to get lucky and something happens between the guys and her?TL;DRMy gf cheated on me after the healing period I fell in love with a girl but she's into another guy and she also said that she doesn't want to date currently until she fights her own demons.Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this!","I'm sorry for the inconvenience.Please contact our customer service for help."
"488","Is my friend fake or am I?","I (31-F) recently realized my best friend (33-F) wants everything that I have and I’m not sure what is bothering me so much about this.She’s a great friend and is really supportive of everything that I do, she’s present and lovely to be around and has helped me through a lot, but whenever I have a new gig aligned; mentorships I start doing; life paths to be choosing etc, she wants in on it too and is very upfront about this.I was already somewhat bothered every time I started a new gig and she would ask me to refer her right on my first week, because of the timing of things, but now what’s been bothering me even more is the fact that not only is she really good at everything I start doing, she doesn’t exactly “share” with me or think of referring me so we could work on things together either.It sometimes feels like a one-sided collaboration and this makes me really sad. I don’t know how to talk about this with her in a positive way, and don’t even know if I should, but it has been bothering me for the longest time and I don’t know what to do. TL;DR! - I don’t know if I’m being a crap friend","Fake."
"489","He said he doesn't feel a ""spark"" is it a bad idea to date casually?","I (28F) started recently getting to know a long time friend (32M) more and we've been casually dating for just over 3 months. He's a great guy & he treats me well & we are good friends together. I decided we needed to have the DTR convo because I was starting to notice myself catching feelings. He basically told me that he really likes me, enjoyed spending time with me, & could continue to date casually for a while, but that if there was ever a time that I wanted to commit he couldn't do that because there was just""something missing"" for him. Essentially I can be “Ms. Right Now"", but never ""Mrs. Right"" for him (not his words, but that's basically what I gathered).I don't want anything serious (marriage, living together, kids, etc) right now either, but I also don't want to make the mistake of ""wasting time"" on a relationship that will never be more than casual. However, there is a part of me that believes even though I know it will end, it still will be fun and I will gain experience and deeper interpersonal skills. Especially since I'm still somewhat healing from my last long term relationship. I'm looking for advice/experience on navigating a casual relationship with someone who has made it clear they don't see themselves long term or taking next steps. The good and bad. TL;DR: I’m dating a guy who doesn’t see a future with me even though he likes me. Should I keep dating him casually or end things?","It's not a bad idea to date casually, but you should be conscious of the potential consequences of doing so. If you're not monogamous, dating casually could lead to emotional and/or sexual betrayal if your partner starts dating other people. If you're considering dating casually, be sure to discuss your intentions with your partner before moving forward."
"490","New relationship (m28) and (f29)","My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 months and it’s been amazing. I dated an abusive and toxic ex for 8 years before. So this relationship has been completely the opposite. We haven’t had any big fights and there’s plenty of communication, honesty, etc. There’s one small problem and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. At first it was fine and I’d joke back. However, it’s beginning to bother me. My boyfriend has a habit of constantly responding to me by saying “rude” or “that’s not nice” or “quit being mean to me”. Even when I’m not being mean. So I started getting upset and he apologizes and truly feels bad. But what really crossed the line for me, is when we were with my dad and he tells my dad to tell me to “stop being mean to him and calling him names”. Which I didn’t. I called him out on it yesterday and he said that he was sorry and it was his attempt at flirting. He hasn’t had any healthy relationships before me, so I don’t know whether to believe that it’s truly his attempt at flirting or what. Am I overreacting?Any advice would be greatly appreciated! TL;DR BF jokes about me “being mean”","The new relationship has not been established yet."
"491","How do I know if it’s okay to break up without a good reason?","Hi. So. I’ve (26F) have been dating this guy (25M) for four months now and we’ve been going steady. Now, this would be my third serious relationship and everything feels great except when it doesn’t. He’s honest and very good guy. Listens to me and wants to be there for me. Yet, I just don’t feel like he’s the one. I mean, I felt like that on our first few dates but it kind of faded. I want to be with someone who’s a lot more into me. In short even though he assures me that he’s not into anyone else, and would never cheat, I feel he can put in a little more effort. He agrees with me when I bring it up and has mended his ways a lot. But I still don’t feel secure. I keep looking for issues. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. If it’s just trauma from my previous relationship. I just don’t want to be with someone if I don’t feel safe. But I also don’t want to hurt him or break up with him without a proper reason because I’m afraid it’s just my head playing games with me. I do like him and care for him a lot. Just not sure if he’s someone I want to share my life with. TL;DR I want to break up with my boyfriend even though I don’t have a real reason but not sure if I should stay in it a little long to find out.","There is no set rule, but generally, it is not okay to break up without a good reason. If you think the break-up is warranted, then citing a specific issue or problem that needs to be fixed is a good way to justify the decision. If you do not have a good reason, then you may be breaking up because you are feeling frustrated or angry, and this may not be healthy for either of you."

He works a 8am to 5pm job. I work a 3pm to 11pm shift. He recently got this job- it pays him better than he has ever seen and I am so happy for him because it’s an automotive job (which he is a car enthusiast). I had my job first and it pays me alright as a woman that loves to help and working with people of disabilities. We have come to a pickle where, I’ll wake up in the morning and he’s gone for work. When he gets home, I’m at work already. Once I get off - he is already asleep. So I never get to talk about my day or visit with him Monday through Friday. On the weekends he expresses he needs to make time for family and friends. Which feels like to me he prioritizes first. I’ve asked to spend a bit more time together on weekends or little as play with my hair to help me sleep once getting home when I have my chronic migraines. He expresses he is being asked to much and I “nag” and I have no respect for his rest or life outside of me. I’ve tried to tone down and let things be what they are but then he says I’m detaching. He starts to not answer my texts through the day and distance himself when he sees I stop “nagging” because if “ I’m on that shit then he is too”.He has been on the line of breaking up and so have I because it feels like we have “no time” for a relationship. But we both don’t want to be without each other. He has gotten emotional about the importance of each other  but he doesn’t make an effort???Do I want this relationship more? and do I continue to detach to self prioritize or do I see this through to make a sacrifice for someone I love? He also likes to make time to work on his own project car which creates more of a distance between him and I. I am more introverted and don’t like to make useless friends and be friendly with acquaintances- but he does. So I am more available than him but I do it for a desire of him and valuable time together. TL;DR He makes me feel like I control him or want to posses him but I feel like I’m asking for almost the bare minimum? Am I being THAT girl?? I can’t ask close friends because they will do the “fuck him girl and move on” but I want HIM.","It sounds like you are experiencing some trouble connecting to your internet service.

"494","I (28M) want to support my wife (26F)'s weight loss efforts but am noticing an impact on our relationship","My wife and I have been married just under a year, but have been together way longer than that. Essentially, she has gained some weight over the years and is unhappy with how she looks and feels. She struggles with some mental health concerns and so is working with a therapist on healthy ways to lose weight. I want her to be happy for sure. We're running into some small effects on the relationship though. 1. We've cut down on eating out. We used to eat out twice a week, now we are down to twice a month. The two of us have very different hobbies and interests, and I didn't realize how much this small change would take away from time together. Eating out was a big thing we did together and without it, our evenings after work are largely empty, or spent individually. We do go to the gym two mornings a week, but evenings are still an issue. We'll play the ""I dunno what do you want to do"" game a bit, and then just retreat to our separate rooms. Fine most of the time, but it would be nice to find at least a partial replacement. Cooking together would be an easy one, but my wife is HANGRY when she comes home and doesn't want me anywhere near her when she makes dinner. 2. Another thing her therapist recommended was mindful eating, which means dinner at the table most nights. Before this, we never ate at the table, always on the couch with the TV on, scarfing food down in 10-ish minutes. Now we're at the table and conversation is a struggle sometimes. After all these years it can be hard to find conversation topics! Do we just...eat in silence? Small problems for sure, but I would love tips and advice. **Tl;Dr my wife is trying to lose weight and her lifestyle changes require relationship adjustments**","It is important for both of you to find a way to support each other's weight loss efforts while maintaining a healthy relationship. You may want to discuss your concerns and find ways to maintain communication and teamwork. You can also support each other by making healthy choices and being supportive of each other's efforts."
"495","Boyfriend making comments on looks","4 months algo I started seeing a guy(24m) and I am 36f. It was unusual for both but things got really intimate, secure, funny, and I started to heal some parts of me with him. After 2 months he stated telling me how much he loves me, he is really into me and how amazing he feels. I was feeling the same and so happy we were having a nice connection. A month algo or so he started to make frequent remarks about how my skin has some acne ( normal period pimple here and there), how my eyes had some small wrinkles, how I have some stray hairs in my face, how my House is full of cat hair and he is disgusted by It. On the day off his birthday he kicked a balloon directed to my cat Who was sitting comfortably resting and scared her. It was just a balloon, but the intention I didn't like. Last weekend after a loving 2 days together and after just 10 min of telling me he loves me, he tells me he is not confident about me, that people Will think he has a problem because he loves a person older than him, etc. It was very hurtful but I decided It was ending for good. Anyways I feel anxious and I started no contact but my anxiety levels are super high at times and a part of me wants him to regret It.Would you say his behaviour about my looks was abusive? Comments?TL;DR;** : boyfriend making mean comments about looks","My boyfriend always comments on how pretty I am. He always seems to really appreciate my looks.

"497","Me(20M) and a “friend”(20F) are falling away from each other","Me(20 M) and a friend(20 F) started talking back in September of ‘22. Things started to pick up gradually between her and I. We both agreed on the “3 month rule,” (basically you stay in the talking stage for three months to see if you get along well, also it is known that people start to show their true selves after about 3 months of dating) our three months would have been in early December. The day before our three months was over she tells me we should go back to being friends for a while, although she never told me why. I didn’t sleep for two days because I was trying to think of every possible scenario where I might have done something wrong. About two weeks later we are hanging and being just friends, I take the opportunity to ask why. She responded with, “I am dealing with a lot of mental issues right now, I get manic out of nowhere and I don’t want to take my episodes out on you.” When I heard that I automatically thought the classic “it’s not you it’s me” bs that people like to pull in order to not hurt your feelings. She assured me that she was being truthful and she just needs time to herself for a while but that we could still be friends. Now I understand having mental issues and them causing the end of relationships and friendship’s because my sister was the same way. I went along with it, now there have been at least 4 times that I can think of that her and I would be hanging out and she does things to get “close” to me(putting her head on my chest, giving me the “I want you smirk,” etc.) and I know that’s what she was doing because she’d admit to it. On top of all of this we have been in two major arguments in the past 3 months because I have always done something wrong, but anytime I mentioned something she did that hurt or upset me she’d excuse it or dodge the topic and blow it off. I still have feeling for her and care about her even after everything, but I feel like the best thing for me and her both is to distance ourselves from each other. What do you guys think?(there is a lot more info to this than what I posted so I can answer any questions in the comments)TL;DR- Girl and had a relationship, she cut it short without telling me why.",".The 20M and 20F are not falling in love with each other, but they have lost some of their previous closeness."
"498","I (25m) am confused after coworker (21f) showing strong interest for a bit then act indifferent","So there’s this girl at work (21F) which I (25M) clicked with right away when we first met. We’re talking here and there but nothing special going on. Few months go by, I suddenly develop strong feelings for this girl. It was quite sudden and intense. At one point it got so intense I decided to tell her about it - she turned me down. No big deal, then we keep talking like normal, but now we gradually start talking even more and get closer in the process. We’re both rather fun in nature, we just have fun in the boring workplace. However, I am no longer going in with any romantic intent/expectation. She’s just a cool person at work that I like to talk to and with whom we have many things to talk about and whom I have interest to get to know better (as a person). Then few months later, suddenly out of nowhere she began showing a strong interest in me for about 2 weeks, perhaps 3. I was riding the wave and enjoying the ride, but I also started developing those strong and intense feelings from before, again. I fell quick and I fell hard. But after those 2-3 weeks, she started to, not slowly but rather quickly, by the day, show less and less interest and attraction, and now we don’t really talk anymore at all. But those 2 weeks felt so so real, it felt like teenagers being in love in high school. It felt so real Whole thing threw me quite off guard really, but the thing that annoys me the most is I have no idea why that last bit happened. And how should I best proceed from the current situation? Do you think it’s a good idea at all to just ask her directly? Doesn’t seem like a good idea to me if Im honest. I am aware that this person(or soul) has some really really special role in my life, I just can’t quite figure it out, and this I am confused about my next move(s) and general direction even. I would much appreciate some guidance/advice.TL;DR - Fell for a girl at work. Told her about it, she turned me down. No big deal. We kept talking, I no longer had romantic expectations or intentions. We start talking more and we get closer, then she suddenly began showing strong interest for 2-3 weeks then suddenly began acting completely indifferent - now we don’t really talk anymore. Idk how to interpret the whole thing, *especially* that last bit.","I think she might be interested in you, but she might not be ready to reveal her feelings yet.

She started following me on social media - and would comment/like my stories etc.I am not sure what happened, but a week ago she soft-blocked me on social media, but then unblocked me a couple of days late. I saw her in the office earlier in the week and it was chill. I have not texted her in over a week. We were on a committee together and the meeting this week was good. She positively reacted to some comments I made and supported my positions. Today - she on vacation and I noticed that she has blocked me again on social media.I find her behavior to be confusing. We are both gay though I don't know if that matters....When we first talked she was very flirty and said she wanted to hang out soon. We talked vaguely to hang, but never made plans. She told me she has social anxiety but is trying to get out of the house more. After she told me that I didn't ask her to hang out cause I want to respect that. About two weeks ago we even talked for 3 hours straight just about random life. She opened up to me about some hardship she was experiencing.I am trying not to take it personally since I understand not wanting your co-workers to see what you are up too on vacation, but it seems completely different from what she was doing even 1 week ago. Did I mess up somehow?Tl;dr: coworker seems to have changed her tune and now randomly softblocks me on social media and then unblocks me. Acts friendly in person.","29 would be the best friendship because they get along well and share common interests. 31 would be the best co-worker because they are both friendly and seem to get along well."

I was tipped off that he liked me last month so him liking me wasn't a surprise, what was a surprise was how fast I feel this is moving. I haven't even had a conversation with this boy, I was thinking he would at least TRY to approach me first y'know flirt a little, maybe ask about the weather or something but no dice.

It can be really confusing and frustrating. The best thing to do is to just wait and see what happens. Sometimes people can be surprised when they like someone and they return the feeling. If the person you like doesn't seem to be interested in you, there is no harm in just being yourself and not trying to force anything. It can be really draining to try to flirt or talk to someone when you don't feel any chemistry. Just relax, take things slow, and see what happens."
"501","Does having mental health issues make someone ""immature"""," I (35f) was talking with my brother (33M) the other day. We were talking about when we were kids. Out of nowhere, he said, ""You were a lot more mature when you were younger, compared to now. Back then, you did exactly what you were told with no questions, you obeyed me, and did everything to please me. Now, you have all these ""mental heath issues, (I only used quotes because he doesn't believe in mental health issues. He says that they're excuses) You're always worried, and paranoid, and you do what you want to do, even if you know that mom and I have a problem with it.""Those were his exact words to me. Even at our age, he still tries to control me. He (and our mother) got upset when I dyed my hair. He said that doing so made me immature because I didn't follow their orders. They treat me like a child, and he's younger. He knows that I have a lot of mental issues, and that I am constantly paranoid / worried, and he said that because of that, I am immature, and act like a child. I was speechless after he said those things to me. I told me mom what he had said. Her response: He always says things like that to me. I kind of agree with him. You were a better daughter when you just did what you were told, and stopped trying to defy us."" Did I mention that I am *35* years old? So infuriating! 😠TL;DR: My Mom and brother called me immature for having mental health issues, and not obeying their every word at 35 years old."," or ""less-than""?No, having mental health issues does not make someone less-than.

It sucks, I never learned to live with it. Escpecially that he is my best friend and the only person I talk to on a daily basis and I am quite attached.

"504","Wanting him to cut a friend off (M30/F25)","Before I get attacked, I wanna say that I know ultimatums are toxic. I was always VERY against them and ironically here I am..thinking of proposing one.TL;DR! This is kinda a continuation form my last post. You dont need to read it, basically my bf was having sex with his friend while we were at the ""talking stage"". And he told me that he slept with her ONLY once and then felt like he was cheating on me. And never did it since. Turns out it was all a lie. He was sleeping with her for a month and I find out because he hearted one of her photos on fb. (he didnt cheat on me since it happened during the talking stage. and they are in different countries, plus shes in a relationship) He met up with her once recently to tell her to cut communication because he's in a relationship and feels bad (at least thats smth)The new piece of information, is that he told me a couple days ago that...while we were together, they were jokingly saying how it would be if she moved to the country he's living now and how they'd be together as a couple. To me that is cheating. I know for some its not. But he literally entertained the idea of being with her and never mentioned that I exist:)He is my very first relationship and im really struggling to let him go. I just cant. I tried, and I always end up going back. So I decided instead of acting immaturely to just suck it up (since I cant leave) and stay until I can no longer take it. cause only then I'll be able to leave and never look back.I thought of proposing an ultimatum. I want her out completely, (not that she did smth wrong, its 1000% his fault) I just find it very disrespectful to hang out with someone you were fucking while lying to me AND entertaining the idea of being together. I dont want him to unfriend/block her. Just no dms (which is already happening) and no meeting from close. Thing is, theyre in the same friend group. so thats like im taking him away from his friends which I absolutely HATE. I hate acting like the insecure girl. I am generally very laid back. I dont care if he hangs out with female friends alone, I trusted him BLINDLY. But now...I cant.Is this a very stupid thing to do you think?","I would like him to cut a friend off."
"505","am i (19f) paranoid about 20m guy Im dating?","I've been seeing this dude for summe time now and hes pretty cool. I am, however, worried about some of the boundaries he had with his woman friends. I dont know if Im being paranoid or if im valid in this concern, but some of the things he does towards some of them in particular rub me the wrong way. The first couple times we were hanging out he told me a bunch of his woman friends are after him but he isnt really interested in them like that. Comepletely unsolicsited comment by the way. We were in the middle of talking about chickpeas. He sprung that on me out of no where. He has admitted to me having crushes on some of his woman friends in the past as well. But he remains platonic with them today. Theres this one woman who I think its kinda obvious he likes, though I havent interacted with them both in the same room enough to tell. I do know his reactions to her when talking about her or when shes not around makes me slightly uncomfortable even if they, in isolation, are nothing glaring. One time he saw her car parked and got really excited and rushed to park right next to hers. There was one time he was talking about her tattoos and how he admired them and how he wanted to get tattoos similiar to that. One time we were hanging out and he said he remembered her saying she wanted some soup earlier that day, so he called her while we were on our date and asked if she wanted the soup she wanted earlier cuz he wanted to pick some up for her. Then there was the time he was showing off this cool tshirt to me he really liked. Come to find out the tshirt was her handmedown he brought off her. I brought it up to him and he hasnt spoken to me in a week. I dont know if I was overreacting and that turned him off or summn. How should I approach him again? Tl;dr guy Im seeing has weird boundaries w some of his girl friends. Idk if Im overreacting though.","There is no one definitive answer to this question. Some people may be paranoid about their partner's intentions or behavior, while others may simply be cautious. It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether they feel paranoid about their partner."

It's a really small team so like everyone knows each other personally and everyone's family's always hang out. Well we started talking in like October and started dating in January (long talking stage). Our families are super good friends and know each other super well and our families do everything together. I was super into the relationship at first but now it's been about 2 months and I kinda want out. I avoid hanging out with her and I don't find her attractive anymore. Like I talk to her and it's like I'm talking to my mom it just doesn't work anymore. But the problem is we do every single sport together and our families do everything together. She's still super super into it but idk I just like being single. I plan on ending it over the summer maybe but that's a long time away and idk what to do. And she's friends with all of my friends and their families. So even if I end it we will still see each other all the time and that's kinda awkward. And she doesn't have much friends but she says that's ok because she has me. But idk I want out I don't like having the responsibilities of a relationship and it takes all the energy out of me.

"507","My (F23) boyfriend (M24) hast trust issues because of me and his ex. How can we fix this?","This is my first time posting and English isn't my first language so sorry in advance.My current relationship of 10 months had a rocky start. My mistake was having a fwb with his roommate and I deeply regret it. After 2 months of having that fwb I started doing more with my now boyfriend (we knew each other for about 1 year until that time). We have common interests like cooking etc. so it felt really natural. And I never thought it could come to us having a relationship, that's why I never thought about the consequences of having a fwb at that time.So when I realized that I am about have a real relationship with my bf I started pushing him away. I had the fear of missing out so I had all sorts of excuses for him and myself, but he was still trying. I was ""frustrated"", and randomly confessed my feelings to fwb while being super drunk and he rejected me. My bf heard of it from other people and was devastated. After that I kind of came to my senses with the help of my friends. He forgave me and we went low contact with fwb even though they are friends.Now we're in a relationship and everything is normal again between me, my bf and fwb. But because of his past relationship (his girlfriend promised to wait for him after he went to USA for a year abroad but got into a relationship with his best friend instead) he has trust issues and our start just feeds into his insecurities.He sometimes has nightmares about me cheating with fwb but I don't know how to tackle that. We're planing to talk about everything that happened so far the next time we meet. But I don't know what else to do. I know I was acting in a irresponsible way in regards of his feelings and I apologized to him many times.I want to make it up to him so bad and I feel so guilty. How can we tackle this situation? I have a feeling that just talking about our past isn't enough.TL;DR: I messed up the start of our relationship and because of trust issues he has from hist past relationships, he has nightmares and is sad overall.","The first step is for you to acknowledge that there is a problem and that you have contributed to it. Next, you need to make a commitment to yourself to do your best to change your behavior. Finally, you need to talk to your boyfriend about what you are going to do to address the trust issue."
"508","Trouble fighting through trust issues (21M) (22F)","I met this girl about a year and a half ago. At the time she was in a relationship, but was obviously not happy. Due to our newfound intimacy, she eventually ended their relationship. Unfortunately at the time, I did not want anything serious with this girl do to the fact she cheated on her ex with me. After distancing myself for a while, she entered another relationship. At the time all I heard from her close circle was how obsessed she was with me and how she couldn’t stop talking about me. This of course reeled me back in and i’m sure you can guess how her second relationship ended. She has left 2 relationships because of me and has told me i’m the only one she’s ever wanted. I’ve never met someone who is so infatuated with me. As you can assume, I eventually entered a relationship with her because of this. It has only been a few months, but there remains a consistent issue. My trust.As crazy as it sounds, I truly don’t think she would betray me, but I cannot ignore her track record. When I see another guy in her snapchat, or her talking to another guy, it creates a sense of discomfort. She has let me go thru her phone and I found nothing incriminating other than guys attempting to flirt but to no avail. One thing that has really stunted my growth in trusting her is the fact that she doesn’t post me on her main social medias. She’ll show me on her private accounts but never her main. When I brought this up to her, she mentioned how she didn’t want her mother or sister knowing that she was in another relationship, which at the time I understood. Her family is now aware of our relationship after a recent trip, so i’m waiting to see if things change regarding her “showing me off”. (keep in mind, all i do is post her all the time, i love showing her off)Is this relationship something worth trusting?How can I fight against my urge to not trust a single thing she says or does?TLDR: My girlfriend left two previous relationships to be with me. Can our relationship be trusted?","I have trouble trusting people, especially people I care about. I feel like they will not always be there for me, and I cannot seem to get over this fear."
"509","How massive of a red flag is it that I (27M) have absolutely zero dating experience?"," I turned 27 just a few weeks ago and am in a state of extreme panic. I have zero dating experience whatsoever. This means I have never been on a date, never kissed anyone, never had sex, and really have not done anything. Being in this situation is absolutely DESTROYING my self confidence and I feel like a freak that I am in this age in this situation. There must be something unimaginably wrong with me right?I am worried that women around my age will think there is something extremely wrong with me even if a miracle does happen and I go out on a date one day. I am currently in the last semester of my master's in mechanical engineering(also same major in undergrad) and searching for a job at the moment. I am extremely shy, have few friends, and am socially awkward. I was almost going to go on my first date ever from a hinge match last week, but she flaked on me 3 hours before my date with an excuse and saying she would reschedule. She never did, and unmatched me a few days later....I feel completely worthless and feel extremely inferior. This is literally not a healthy situation for me to be in for my personal development. I want this to change ASAP. I started weightwatchers and am trying to lose weight to be healthier.Meeting people is essentially impossible because I live right next to my university campus where I am surrounded entirely by 18-20 year olds and did not bring a car(because I live right next to campus, where I also work as well...). Being in this situation is handicapping me at meeting people. I have considered matchmaking services and also speed dating events because dating apps are not working for me. Could speed dating events be a good way to meet some people? I have never tried it but was thinking it's a good idea.I don't want to die alone. I am seriously worried that I will die alone. Who is 27 and never kissed anyone? It's literally just me. I am a freak. I don't even know anymore..... Even if I do attract someone by a miracle they will think I am insanely weird for being in this situation. I don't know what to do.... How does someone make it through high school, college, and now graduate school and have NO ONE be interested in him? Of course it would freak women out.TLDR, no dating experience at all at 27 and need help. Am I doomed? Will I die alone?","It can be quite alarming when someone has little to no dating experience. It could signify that the person is not interested in dating or that they are not successful when it comes to dating."
"510","Should I (25F) keep talking to my ex hookup's (26M) close friend (26M) or leave the situation altogether?","I have this friend that l've hooked up twice with, one sort of recently & It was never anything serious. While we've only actually ever hooked up twice, we have made multiple plans to hook up. A few times, I realized that he was secretly in a relationship and was contemplating cheating on his girlfriend with me. We were supposed to get together recently and it happened that it never came to fruition. I guess he must've gotten another girlfriend, so he's fallen back for now. NOW, he has a guy friend (also 26 M) that has been interested in me and we even talked a few years back, before I knew they were friends, and things just never went anywhere. We just started talking again and he's a great guy, but there's a voice in the back of my head saying that I would be wrong for starting something with this guy since l've slept with one of his good friends. Guy A and I hooked up long before Guy B was in the picture, but it still feels like I'm messing with ""Guy Code."" If things get serious with Guy B, I do plan on telling him, but is that too late? Should I tell him now? Should I even be entertaining him knowing that l've been intimate with his close friend? Am I overthinking this whole thing? HELP. Thank you for any advice. TLDR;Should I (25F) continue to talk to my old hook-up's (26M) close friend (26M) or should I leave this situation and find a new guy altogether?","It depends on the situation. If the close friend is helping the ex hookup out, then it's probably better to stay in the situation. If the close friend is making the ex hookup feel unwelcome or uncomfortable, then it might be better to leave the situation altogether."
"511","My girlfriend [25F] and I [26M] have almost no sex life…","Together for over 3 years, we’ve never had much of a sex life.Currently, I’d say we attempt to have sex once every ~3 weeks or a month on average. Most of the time when we do try, we end up having to stop because she doesn’t feel anything or it hurts her. It usually feels like a burden to have sex too, it takes a lot of warm-up time, etc. Almost to the point where my sex drive naturally goes away before actually getting to it.The funny thing is that whenever she drinks alcohol (rarely), she almost instantly wants to have sex. She’s expressed to me that her being unable to feel things comes from her anxiety and her history of trauma, so I guess that’s why the alcohol helps her. I totally understand that, but it’s sometimes difficult for me when I don’t feel sexually desired. She always tells me that she’s attracted to me, but that only goes so far if we aren’t being sexual. Sex was always a huge part of my previous relationships, as I am a physical lover. My girlfriend is more of a verbal lover.It also pains me to have to masturbate so often, as I wish I could just share those intimate moments with my lover. As we get older, I also worry about things only getting worse. I sometimes feel like I’m missing out on enjoying my body in a sexual way.Any advice or tips? We are perfect in every other way…TLDR: my girlfriend and I of 3 years hardly ever have sex and I often feel undesired or that I’m missing out.","There could be a number of reasons why your girlfriend and you have almost no sex life. It could be that you two are not interested in sex or that your girlfriend has other commitments that keep her busy.

I don’t think in terms like that but I think it implies like certain expectations that make me uncomfortable. I was very invested in exploring the potential of our friendship in the fall, but I found that some things felt incompatible, like it felt hard to be or get really close to her (to me). I recently feel more distant from her and closer to other close friends, so I feel like if she has an expectation that I view her as my closest person then maybe I should say something in case that distance naturally widens? We talk and meet less than we did before  but last night she said “I have two best friends but of course you’re number one”. And I said I don’t like hierarchy like that and I don’t need to be #1.Her using this term, makes it feel like I’d really hurt her if I did or said anything that’s not “bff” behavior, but I never signed up for this, so I’m scared to even bring it up for some reason. TDLR: I was close to a friend in the fall but feel less close now. She still calls me her bff despite us meeting and talking less, should I say something?","There's no harm in telling your friend that you don't feel that way and that you'd like to be friends instead. It can be nice to have friends who you don't have to constantly reassure that you're still their friend."

With that I have a girlfriend who doesn't play any instrument. This isn't a problem for me, it never was a problem or a downside to dating her. Yesterday after school my friends and I were on the bus talking about music and such, which turned into 2 of my friends (excluding me) having a conversation about that one of them wouldn't want to date someone who wasn't into music and playing instruments. I chimed in and said ""I think it's definitely a bonus if a girl is into music like that but it isn't a deal breaker, making music with my girlfriend sounds like a dream though"" now when saying that I'm in my girlfriends arms and I didn't think anything of it or she would he offended at all. She didn't act offended until when we were on discord that night in a private call she said ""I think I want to learn how to play piano because I want to make your dreams come true"" I said that was great but what did she mean about making my dreams come true. She said on the bus I said it's attractive when a girl plays a instrument and how it's a dream to make music with your girlfriend and I don't want you to leave me for someone who can do all of that"" In that moment I didnt know what to say, I ended up saying I would never leave her for a reason like that and I like her for her and she shouldn't want to change for me or anyone else. She told me she was gonna go. Today in school she didn't say much about anything to me and she has been slow to replying to text and such. I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like I really messed up and I just don't know where to start to fix itTd;lr I said Its my dream to make music with girlfriend one day and now my girlfriend who doesn't know anything about music feels like I'm not in our relationship for the long haul.","?I'm sorry to hear that your girlfriend is shying away from you because of your musical interests.

Well, a person I've been friends with for a long time finally confessed that they were attracted to me, we exchanged a few NSFW images, and I confessed my attraction towards them.I felt like I should tell friend A, so I did.  They seemed upset, and I'm assuming for a valid reason. I shouldn't have lead them on, I guess. It's difficult, because I really valued person a as a friend.

"515","How to cope up with my own horrible action","I was in a 10 years long distance relationship. We were amazing as friends. In the starting years, I was really into him but as the time went by I no longer was in love. I started to distance myself but he kept on persuading me that we can make everything alright. We both were struggling in career and we're each others shoulder to cry on. After four years we were in same city again but from there our relationship started falling apart. I broke up multiple times but kept patching up after seeing him devastated and crying. Once again I got job far away and moved again. Long distance kept on going. We kept breaking up and patching up. But somehow I fell out of love. I was with him due to guilt because I thought I was with him for long. He kept falling deeper and deeper and it was totally opposite for me. Eight months ago we broke up again due to some silly reason and because of my resentment towards him or relationship I said yes to a marriage proposal to someone else. Now preparation for my marriage is going on and I got to know that he still is not moving on and is devastated.Now I feel horrible but I can't go back again. I closed that return door for me. He is having suicidal thoughts, I tried to make hime understand that he needs to move on but he says that love is commitment and I spoiled him for life. I feel like I am the worst person in whole wide world. For a moment I became so selfish that I seeked a better relationship somewhere else. But since my anger is diminishing I am regretting my decision but my marriage is less than a month now and I can't back out as it will affect a lot of people. I can't enjoy my life. Everything is great in this new relationship but I feel like I don't deserve all this while he is suffering. I am unable to sleep. I feel this constant weight on my chest.tl;dr: What should I do now? Anyone please help I can't think straight.🙏","There are a few things that you can do in order to cope up with your own horrible action. One thing that you can do is talk to someone about it. Talking to someone can help you feel better and can hopefully help you to understand why you did what you did. Another thing that you can do is reflect on the situation. Reflecting on the situation can help you to understand what happened and can help you to learn from your mistakes. Finally, you can try to forgive yourself. forgiving yourself can help you to move on from the situation and may help you to feel better about yourself."

I always told myself that I didn’t need a man and I didn’t want a bf but then I met him. He is the nicest person I have met and he makes me so incredibly happy, I wait for his messages and find myself smiling at my phone when I see his name and looking at pictures of the two of us. But I always had those little thoughts in my head of what if it’s a joke or does he really like me even though he’s always said how much he likes me but I think it’s because I’m a massive overthinker. Well he told me that he loved me on Valentine’s Day! And to be honest I was terrified, no one has ever said that to me before and I guess I’ve never thought that anyone could love me. He always tells me he loves me but I still had those silly doubts. This morning I woke up to a long paragraph from him explaining the things he loves About me, and that he promises to be the best he can. He also said that he wished I loved him as much as he loves me. It made me tear up because I do love him I am completely head over heels  for him. But his message has wiped those doubts.

"517","Visiting his city, should I reach out again?","Tl;Dr: Should I reach out to my long distance ex because I’ll be in his city this week?I ended a long distance relationship in October and I took it really hard. Like over dramatic teenager level heartbreak. I (34f) broke up with him (33m) because things weren’t progressing as quickly as I wanted them to and I wasn’t sure he’d ever be ready for the level of commitment I was looking for. I didn’t realize how deeply I loved him until it was over. I was maybe the most depressed I’ve ever been but I’d finally started to feel ok again within the last month. I’m visiting my best friend in his city this weekend for the first time since the breakup and all the emotions are back. I had a lot of bad memories there before I met him, but now going just feels unbearable. Yesterday it really sunk in that he doesn’t want to get back together and I’m back to crying every time I think about him. Which is often because I’m packing and getting ready for my trip and I can’t think about it without thinking about him.I think part of the reason prepping for this trip is so hard is because I know it will be the final nail in the coffin. It’s one thing for him to ignore me when I’m on the other side of the country, but when I’m in his city, with our mutual best friend, I can’t pretend he still wants me anymore. Any little glimmer of hope for us will be gone and I’ll have to accept that it’s really over. I don’t want it to be over. If I’m being honest, even writing this post now is just a desperate attempt to get his attention even though the chances of him being on this sub are slim to none. I caved a few weeks ago and called leaving a message that I was coming and wanted to see him but he never responded. He didn’t want the breakup so I know it’s not fair of me to expect him to take my call but the idea of being there and not seeing him is killing me. Should I try reaching out again or do I need to let it go?","It might be best to reach out to him again once you have had a chance to visit his city again."
"518","How to support a friend headed for a burnout?","My (31F) best friend (33F) has had a very high pressure job for years. A lot of (international) travel is involved, which obviously stopped during covid. During that time she started teaching yoga classes in our hometown and got into a relationship. Since last spring her travels have returned. First gradually and then all at once. The relationship (extra family obligations) and yoga now leave her with a schedule that is totally unsustainable. On top of that a very emotional event happened a month ago. The grief seems to be the final drop, and to me it’s pretty clear that she’s heading for a burnout (she already has blood pressure problems despite being otherwise healthy). Now here’s the kick: I’m the one she always cancels on when she feels tired. Which is all the time lately. We make a plan that fits into her crazy schedule, I get excited because I’ll finally see my best friend again, only for her to cancel on the day because she can’t get out of bed. I always offer to come over and just be with her anyway, watch a film from bed or whatever, but she always refuses. We do call and text basically daily. My work isn’t anywhere near as crazy, but I do also work 50hr weeks. So when she cancels our evening plans, I cannot “spontaneously meet up for a coffee the next day” because she happens to have a free 45mins then. I obviously don’t want her to go over any more of her own boundaries to meet up with me!! And 100% understand that I’m the one she cancels on because she feels comfortable. So i try to be patient and just be as flexible and understanding as I can be. Yesterday she expressed that she feels alone dealing with her grief and like I’m not there for her enough. I’m not gonna lie, part of me wants to yell like “remember those last five plans that we made a month in advance and you cancelled???!” Which I know is not fair and won’t help the situation. But I also feel like there’s not much more that I can do other than keep checking in on her, let her know I’m thinking of her and hope to see her someday soon. Am I missing something? Do I just show up at her house uninvited?? I’m super introverted and nothing recharges me like solitude. So I’d be seriously pissed off if a friend would barge in on my exhausted alone time lol 🥹 But then again, I’ve also never been in a similar situation. TLDR: I think my best friend is heading for a burnout. I want to support her, but she keeps cancelling all of our plans.","Be tolerant and understanding. Encourage your friend to seek professional help. Help them connect with support groups or medication guidelines. Listen and offer encouragement. Let them know you care."
"519","I lost my girlfriend due to my insecurities I want her back (m27) (f27)LDR","I broke up with my LDR girlfriend because she lied to me about small things e.g. staying in a complete different city overnight for a police case (she was being catfished) while she told me she was in university for a meeting. Seeing a dating app on her phone which she forgot to delete as it was from an old backup. Then a dating profile of hers which she said she was being ‘catfished for’. We both said we love each other and wanted to spend our lives together but logic convinced me otherwise. She downloaded a dating app the next day because she needs attention and has never been dumped before. My gut still believes her and she’s ‘like you never even gave us a chance’. I’m afraid I screwed everything up and I want her back. It’s hurting real bad and I don’t know what to do.I also am aware that when finding out about this hinge profile initially, I got super mad and spent a whole week arguing with her and not believing her words when I should have just trusted her words. I went into full detective mode asking for access into her social media and asking for evidence she reported the accounts when I should’ve trusted her. Tldr: ldr gf of 9 months, lied about whereabouts and told me she stayed in a complete different city overnight in an Airbnb  (she has a police case for being catfished). Saw a dating app on her phone when I met her but she said it was from an old backup. Her hinge profile was re-uploaded when she went back to a different city and she claimed it was a catfish of hers. I accused her of cheating and she didn’t really give evidence regarding it and then She said she wanted space to think but I dumped her because of everything that was suggested to me. However I still love her and I want her back. Not sure how to proceed.","If you're feeling lost and alone, it's natural to want to find your lost girlfriend or spouse. However, if you're not willing to work on your insecurities, you may not be able to have a healthy relationship again. If you're still deeply in love with your ex, it's important to focus on your own happiness and healing. Seek out support from family and friends, and work on rebuilding your self-confidence.

He has a really shitty past with his his dad and a few “friends”I’be asked him before if he was planning on ever telling her about anything and he just replied with a “nope”I asked him why and he said that he’s scared on how he’ll react if he tells herSo is it reasonable that he hasn’t said anything or should him or I bring it up? (obviously if I were to bring it up I’d be asking for his permission first)Ps. I love his girlfriend to bits and Id never want to hurt her but keeping all the stuff I have to can just be a bit exhausting(TL; DR  So my ex is keeping big secrets from his gf and is scared on how she’ll react if she finds out but is it bad that he’s keeping them? Should someone say something’s about it?)","It may be best for him to keep some secrets from his girlfriend, if doing so will make her happy.

"521","“Why do you love me?”","22M with 21F, 5 years“Why do you love me?”5 years down the drain… i (22M) broke up with my girlfriend (21F) of 5 years…. I don’t think she loves me anymore, and hasn’t for at least a year. Is “why do you love me?” “how do you love me?” too hard of questions to answer? I mean I can answer it very easily… her not so much… I don’t even know where to start. she comes home from school and then I’m supposed to live there while she’s there every weekend for the last 2 years. despite it being a decently longer drive to work on workdays… she’s slept at my house maybe one time in the last year at least… the same girl who used to live in my room until I got home from work… energy anywhere isn’t matched. She wants a date night and it includes going out spending spending spending, while she of course doesn’t have the money. then it’s my fault we don’t have “enough” date nights enough despite her contributing nothing. The little shit too. Want a snack in bed? I’ll end up getting my own but the second it’s her… like she literally can’t say she helps in any department of a relationship. She gets mad we don’t text enough during the week and then spends all weekend on her phone… the only way she could say she shows me any type of love is when she cooks… and that comes with my helping and doing dishes… then we are a 50/50 relationship she loves. We won’t even talk about all the shit I gladly did for her mother. From redoing her front porch, taking care of her yard all summer, and just the little repairs. I also wasn’t good enough for that (LOL). Just when I have complaints it’s an issue. Idk what I’m looking for now… sound ridiculous reading this… extremely clear again she doesn’t love me.TLDR: felt like an idiot writing this, and feels clear now... but is “why/ how do you love me?” an unfair question to ask someone you have been with for 5 years? and then to not answer it???","There is no simple answer to this question. Love is a feeling that can be described in many ways, and can be felt in different ways for different people. Some people might say that they love someone because they are kind, caring, and understanding. Others might say that they love someone because they make them feel happy and complete. Ultimately, the answer to this question is something that each person must discover for themselves."
"522","Should I text her someday or let her come to me?","I started texting this girl I met month and a half ago. After about 2 weeks into our texting I asked to take her out for a drink, but she declined because she just got out of a long relationship, about a month and a half before I contacted her. I said that's ok, I understand, and that I don't have a problem with her recent break up I just want to meet her in person... She told me that it wouldn't be fair towards me, and that she wanted to take it slow, so we just continued to text. Our texting became even more frequent, we had some deep conversations, she texted me often and everything felt very natural. We seemed to be a good match. I made some more moves (nothing serious) and kind of got a little needy and impatient, and she would remind me that she isn't ready yet.Then she became cold and said she was depressed, but still we texted and it seemed like she still enjoyed my attention I was giving her. Then I suggested a date one more time (all or nothing), but she reminded me that she isn't feeling well and again that it wouldn't be fair to me. I said I get that, but that I honestly though she needed to fight her depression and that I just wanted to meet her one time for now. She told me that she did need to fight it, but not with someone else, to which I agreed (she opened my eyes) and said that I respected that. She thanked me, and that's it. We never had any arguments btw.Looking at it now I guess I was pushy, but also I didn't want to be her texting buddy. I believe she was honest with me, and that it just wasn't the right time, but I just didn't listen. This was more or less just me venting, because I haven't met someone like her in a long time...TLDR: It seemed we had great time texting, but she isn't ready to meet new people because of her previous relationship.","It depends on what you want from the interaction. If you want a quick interaction where you can pump her for information, then texting is probably the best way to go. If you want a longer interaction where you can get to know her better, then you should try to meet her in person."
"523","I (27f) am in love with my (34m) boyfriend, but I don’t think he actually loves me 🥴","UPDATE: He texted me today saying he was going to come over, which was a pleasant surprise because I always went to him. He knew I was having a terrible day, so I thought he was coming over to comfort me and cuddle together. I thought that was his way of showing more effort. Nope. He came over holding a bag full of my shit, fake crying, and immediately starts to break up with me. Completely blindsided. I feel broken. I have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half now. All relationships has its ups and downs, but I’m starting to think that he doesn’t actually love me (faking the relationship). I feel like I’m chasing after this version of him (when he was more present, open with me, affectionate, etc) or to reestablish emotional intimacy. I expressed these feelings to him, cried, and he just sat there with a blank stare. I’m not sure what to make of it. I try to remind myself that if he wanted out, he would just break up with me…but I don’t actually believe that he would. Im not sure where to go from here or how to process it all. I don’t feel like a priority or someone he truly values and wants to spend quality time with me. It’s almost like I’m burden. I’m stuck between going with my gut and accepting the possibility that we are incompatible or chalking this up to relationship anxiety, and to continue working on it. Thoughts?TL;DR: I am in love with my bf and I think he has been faking his feelings for me. I don’t know if it’s relationship anxiety or something else. Thoughts?","This can be a difficult situation to navigate. First, it is important to remember that love is a complicated and multi-dimensional emotion. While your boyfriend may appear to love you very much, there may be other aspects of his love that you do not experience. It is important to communicate your feelings to your boyfriend and see what he suggests might be best for all involved. If he is unwilling or unable to change, it may be necessary to consider ending the relationship. However, before making any decisions, it is important to consult with a professional counselor who can help you explore all of your options."
"524","my bf (23m) doesnt want to let me (20f) go","I have lost romantic feelings for my current boyfriend as he does not meet my expectations in a relationship. I feel like I am somewhat stuck with him because if I would break up with him completely then it would be bad for me financially and he would be completely broken. He has had a pretty tough childhood where his mother was never there and he was constantly neglected. He grew up poor and has had to go through a lot of traumatic events, as well as growing up with bad influence. I am pretty convinced he has PBD and that he is too attached to me as I feel somewhat of a mother figure to him. I have given him a chance for a better and calmer life with a lot of support but since I have depression I need that support and help just like he does. I do most chores around our home - cleaning, cooking, laundry, dishes and even though i have told him to be more involved in helping me out he still has not shown his effort. We both have a job, although his salary is higher than mine, and without his financial support i wouldn’t be able to pay rent and all bills. Lately our relationship has been very rocky as I don’t want to be romantic or intimate with him and he normally isn’t an intimate person at all. He does sincerely apologise with flowers when he has done something to upset me though, which I like a lot and appreciate. When we fight we fight loudly and aggressively (but never physically) and I have told him four times now that I do not want to be with him as I don’t have feelings anymore but he loves me and is very attached. He has shown me unconditional care because he is terrified of losing me. At this point I feel like i am stuck in life because I can’t really be free and live my own life anymore because no matter of my feelings he still wants to be with me and I genuinely believe he would be back to rock bottom when I would leave him completely and cut all ties. I want to know if I should do what’s best for me and break up, which would result in hurting him a lot(which i would not forgive myself) or try to fix our relationship and change him as a person so he would be who i want him to be. tl;dr: my boyfriend is extremely attached to me but i have lost feelings towards him and i want to break up. He does not let me go and is begging for a chance to continue being together. should i break up and cut all ties or give him a chance to be better person for me.","your bf may not want to let you go because he cares about you. He may want to keep you around because he enjoys your company or he may just want to keep you around for different reasons. If the two of you are not interested in each other romantically, it may be best to talk about your feelings and see if there is a way to work around the situation."
"525","(F21) Advice on how to tell my bf (M21) that I am moving back home after college","I have a really hard dilemma i’m facing. My boyfriend (M21) and I (F21) have been dating for a few months and are in a committed relationship. We have discussed our future together (marriage, family, kids) and I really like him. However, in June I will be graduating from college and I’m not really sure what is next for me. Due to family circumstances and financial reasons, I will most likely be moving back home (which is a 6 hour drive). I made this decision recently after talking to my parents and I feel like it would be best for me. I don’t know if a long distance relationship would work for me or my partner. I don’t really know how to communicate this because I’m scared how he will react and I don’t want to break his heart. I don’t know the best way to approach this is. On the other hand, my boyfriend has mentioned to me that he is going to continue living with his parents because it will save him money, so I know where he stands. I don’t feel like we are at the stage where we are ready to move in together. This situation is honestly very saddening for me because I don’t want to lose him but I feel like we can’t make long distance work. I really value him as a person and I don’t want to hurt him but I’m not sure if things can work. Does anyone have any advice on how to have an open conversation about this and how to approach it? TLDR; in a committed relationship, but I’m graduating soon and moving back home after college. I haven’t told my boyfriend yet because I’m not sure how to approach this and how our relationship would work long distance.","Firstly, try to be honest with him about your plans. You may not want to hear everything he has to say, but Talking about it will hopefully make the transition smoother. Secondly, make sure you take everything he says into account. He may have been there for you during your time away, and he may be apprehensive about your return. Finally, be supportive and understanding. He may be feeling a lot of emotions at once and just need to process everything before he can react."
"526","Does love waiver/falter after arguments or when things get hard?","My boyfriend (M19) of 1 year (we’ve been best friends since elementary school but started dating 1st year of college) and I (F19) got into an argument. In one of our first big arguments, he questioned whether he loved me or not, but reassured me that he wouldn’t question it again after we had talked about it and we both felt more secure in the relationship after that. We got into an argument in a call today, where I tried to explain my point and why I was upset (i dont think the reason is the point of the post but i’ll explain if needed) but he said he didn’t want to say anything that could make the mood worse so we ended the call. I thought that was valid and mature and we kept communicating through text. After we had calmed down enough, I asked him if he still questioned whether he loves me or not, with his response being “it waivers but I will always love you” what the fuck does that mean. I love him, and even though we get into arguments and things get hard because of life, my love for him never waivers or falters because why would it? My view is that things like love dont falter that easily. Yes, people get into arguments and get upset at each other, but iis it that easy for love to waiver? Is my way of thinking skewed? I don’t understand.[tl,dr:] boyfriend said his love waivers/falters when we get into arguments or hardships in our relationship, but he still loves me and that nothing would change that.[update]: We met up, talked about the situation, and it ended in us just realizing we were miscommunicating. I already had a hunch that he meant waivering affections while arguing, but it was nice to really hear it from him and know that he wasn’t trying to hurt my feelings or manipulate me. I made the post while in a very impulsive/high off emotion mood but all of the replies were genuinely very helpful =)) thank you!","Yes, love can waiver after arguments or when things get hard."
"527","I [19F] don't want to have sex with my boyfriend [19M] anymore","tl;dr I don't want to have sex with my boyfriend anymore, but I don't want to break up with him, and he doesn't want to break up either.I've been with my boyfriend for about 10 months. I told him I was asexual the moment we started dating, and he was fine with that because he didn't have a sex drive either. A month in, he said he did have an interest in sex, and two months later we had sex for the first time. I was completely indifferent about it since it made him happy. Right before I left to go to university, he coerced me into sex. He begged for over an hour, and I cried the second I got on top of him. He asked me if he should keep going, and I just said that I didn't care, and he went until he finished while I was crying.A couple of weeks ago, he did the same thing, except I didn't cry until afterwards.I'm just not interested in sex, but my boyfriend is really horny. Everything else in our relationship is amazing, but it's the sex that's the issue. I don't want to have sex anymore. I was always indifferent or ""whatever"" about sex with him since it made him happy, but now I just don't want to anymore. I still give him handjobs, but not sex. I told him this, and he seemed sad, but he doesn't want to break up (neither do I). I told him he'll probably end up feeling resentful in the long run if we don't have sex. He just said he didn't know, and he doesn't want to break up with me.I also found out that he wants children eventually. I don't want children; I'm child free, and very firm on that position. I won't give birth, and I won't adopt. I told him that if we wants children in the future, we probably aren't going to work out. He said that I'm more important than having children, but I told him he'll probably be resentful in the future as well, since you can't compromise on children.I'm not sure what to do. I love him so much, and everything in our relationship is great, but I don't want to have sex with him anymore. What should I do?","There could be a lot of reasons why you don't want to have sex with your boyfriend anymore. Maybe you're not feeling sexually interested in him anymore, or you're not comfortable with the way things are between you two. It's important to talk to your boyfriend about why you want to stop having sex with him and see if he can understand and support your decision. If he doesn't agree or can't accommodate your needs, then it might be time to talk about moving on."
"528","how do I get my husband to clean better?","I (28f) have been married for almost 7 years (29m)to my spouse. He has never been as neat as me and I was  okay with that at first since he worked more than me at the time. He then started struggling to keep jobs because he struggled to stay awake.  We agreed that while we were waiting for treatment I would work and he would stay home and watch our (3f) year old and take care of the house. It took about 1 year and half to get treatment but he's been having issues longer than that. I've tried to be patient and would have conversations with him to step up his cleaning game. He would apologize say he would do better then about a week later would back how it was. I let the house slide a little to try to meet in the middle cause he was new to it and he was dealing with what turned out to be a medical issues. He was treated a month ago now and says he feels better. The house looks somewhat nicer I'll admit but it still is pretty messy. Most of the time he says he ""doesn't see the mess"" or it ""just not up to my standards"" I should add I'm still coming home and picking up, doing my half of the dishes, my half of laundry, trash and much more. We have fought about it constantly to the point I'm at my wits end. He suggested I write him a list to do so I did and he would do like 60 percent of it then 40 percent of the list I would have to fight with him to do or he would say it is done but clearly not. There would be like 10 things on the list for the week in addition to straightening up the house. If it was me I would be able to finish the list in less than a day but I know he isn't me.I have communicated clearly what I need him and even had time limits put in place but he would still not do it. Is there anything I can do at this point?TL;DR! Is there anything I can do to get husband to do his part of the cleaning since he stays home?","There is no one definitive answer to this question, as it depends on your husband's personality and habits. Some ideas you could try include setting specific cleaning goals for him, pointing out the negative consequences of not cleaning his room, or disapproval gestures if he doesn't clean up after himself."
"529","I (19F) feel like the relationship with my boyfriend (20M) should end","Me (19F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been together for 3 years. For the first two years, things seemed good and happy and all. But this past year, everything just seems to be going downhill. Like I said, everything was going good for about the first two years. I hit a really rough point in august of last year, depression & anxiety. That’s when I began noticing that I’m not sure if he’s there for every season in life. Before hitting my own rough patch though, I started to notice a few differences in him as time was progressing. He started complaining a lot more (about literally everything), very little communication about how he was feeling, always acting like the world was coming down on him, little motivation to move forward in life after high school, seems to want to be sexual a majority of the time, a bunch of broken promises, and for me it seemed like he would stomp on my parade just because he didn’t have anything to celebrate. These things have been brought up through conversations, which ended up leading to arguments because he would just say “well I guess I’m just the shittiest boyfriend ever…,” but after the argument he would change/work on himself for about a week, then it would go back to exactly how it was. To add on-top of it all, his family has treated me like complete crap through a majority of our relationship. I have talked to him about it, even to the point where I’m balling crying, and he’ll just sit there like I’m not hurting from their comments. (Their comments include that I’m privileged, rich, talking their son away, and even to the point when his father yelled at me about it all). Even though I’m a complete stranger to all of you, I can stand firm in the fact that I never have been disrespectful towards them in any shape or form. I have recently talked to him about all of this and explained that I feel like we’re both growing in separate directions, which now he is starting to attempt to change, but admitted that it was because I was about to to break up with him. I’m just confused on what to do/how to go about it all. Do I break up with him or do I stay and see if things get better as he’s trying to change? This past year has been hard, and I think this has lead to my depression and a anxiety also, so I’m just conflicted. TL;DR: I feel like my boyfriend and I are growing apart because of how he acts within his life. He’s trying to change but I just feel conflicted on how things will be in the long term. How should I go about it? Leave or stay for the change?","I (19F) feel like the relationship with my boyfriend (20M) should end because I am not happy and it is not working out."

We never really meet up anymore and do fun things, we only sleep together when we’re out with friends which doesn’t feel right to me and makes me want to stop being intimate with him. When i ask to hangout he says he’s to busy, but he plans whole weekends with his friends… Last monday i got in discussions with him about this again. I told him i would stop doing all this effort if he gives me nothing. He told me that he didn’t want to change as a person, but that’s not what i’m asking from him and i already told him that he doesn’t need to. Well i stopped texting him and i now haven’t spoken him since then… I don’t really know what to do since i told him i didn’t want a relationship where we don’t talk at all… He told me the relationship wouldn’t end if i stopped acting like that but for me it kinda is. I understand that he doesn’t want to text all day long and i’ve told him that already, but not texting at all doesn’t feel right to me since we also don’t see each other that much.TL;DR boyfriend doesn’t want to text first or ask to hangout and i’m done with doing it alone and now we don’t talk"," as much as he used to.It might be that he's preoccupied with other things.

We have each other’s numbers as we were vaguely friends before that.I rarely work with him and he luckily seemed to be losing interest until a week ago when we had a shift together he kept staring me to the point I felt watched. He gave some over the top compliments that I just said “...thanks” to and offered me his Netflix login to watch a show (I declined). As were talking at the counter I mentioned YouTube horror series Salad Fingers, he was only working the morning said he would watch it when he went home. An hour and a half later he messages me saying he’s watched it and I’ve “got a dirty mind!” (Salad Fingers is surreal horror- not sexual at all).How do I tell him that message was inappropriate the least awkward way? Diplomatic wording advice appreciated.Further context: I do not encourage him at all, I keep replies to his messages short and I wear the same unflattering outfit to work with no make up every time. I’d rather not report him to the manager if possible as she is good friends with his mum and it could get really messy.TLDR: Colleague I romantically declined last year messaged me saying I have a “dirty mind” last week.

"532","My (25f) boyfriend (25m) speeds on his motorcycle and won’t stop.","Hi everyone! Thanks for reading in advance. My boyfriend and I just celebrated our first anniversary but this is an issue that hasn’t stopped coming up throughout our relationship. He just started riding about 2 years ago, and has a Ninja (sports bike) and he just bought me my first motorcycle for my birthday last September. I’ve ridden with other people for maybe the last ~5 years. I’m still in the process of learning to ride and being comfortable on a bike by myself so the only time I see him riding is when we are together which has only happened a few times. Other than that, all I know is what he tells me or what Life360 shows me. He loves to speed. Before we were officially together, he would be super proud to tell me he hit 160mph while on the highway earlier in the day, trying out wheelies, laughing about outrunning police, etc etc. Our very first fight ever was about how he rides his bike, and we just had our 80th argument about it again tonight. For a little history, my ex and I were in an on again-off again relationship for years and it was very abusive. Every time we would break up I would receive videos of him going to bars and getting hammered and speeding around town on his bike in efforts to get my attention because he knew I still cared for his well-being and would say something. In the very beginning of my current relationship there were a few nights where he would go out and get too drunk and ride his bike home. I told him from the very beginning I was NOT okay with his behavior and riding drunk/recklessly was a deal breaker for me. I’m a paramedic, I’ve seen too many dead bikers and people with serious injuries from making stupid decisions and I don’t want that for him. He has calmed down a lot on his riding since we’ve been together. He rarely speeds now, but every now and then he takes it out and still goes twice the speed limit whenever he can justify it. This means long stretches of empty roads/no traffic. I don’t know what to do anymore. Just tonight I saw he reached a speed of almost 110 on his 4 mile ride home from work where the speed limit is 55 max. He rarely goes over 110 now and says he’s calmed down enough so he doesn’t understand why I get upset. What do I say to him so he understands?TLDR: Boyfriend likes going fast on motorcycle. I’ve seen too many dead people that were going fast on motorcycles. How do I make him slow down?","It sounds like your boyfriend is speeding on his motorcycle and not stopping. This is Dangerous Driving and could lead to a conviction. If he does not stop soon, he could also be injured or killed. You need to speak to him about how he is driving and see if he is willing to stop. If not, you may need to take action to prevent him from driving this way. You can talk to him about how dangerous it is to drive this way, or you can take steps to stop him from driving this way. If he does not stop, you may need to take appropriate action to protect yourself and/or him."
"533","Help!! Lose interest after 3 months","This has been going on for as long as I can remember. Any time I speak to a guy it will go perfectly. I will get to know him (and genuinely LIKE him very much and then after a few weeks the thought of them suddenly sickens me and I despise even the thought of them (for no reason at all!) This has happened so many times I've noticed a pattern of me losing interest in exactly 3 months. It's never for any reason in particular, the guys l've spoken to were very genuine and nice people.

The thing is, her parents refused to let her come alone to my country, that's why they decided that her uni friend (guy) to come too, even tho I feel like she is annoyed from that.(She would pay for her nights and food etc)The thing is I'm kind of person who has never been in a relationship before (22 years old virgin), it's not I didn't have the opportunity but I just wasn't caring! and still I'm not thinking about having one right now, but I don't mind if it is for a limited time I don't know, for experience...She told me before that sometimes she feels strange as she sees her other classmates get in a relationship or at least were having an ex while she never had one before... So I was asking myself, did she just want anybody to be with? Why does she wanna come?Also I don't know what to do, I mean I don't know if she is coming here just to meet me? Or to just spend some good time? Or want to have some sex experience..In fact, we were talking about a lot of stuff in these 3 years, and I guess that made her think I'm interested?I feel like asking her exactly why she wanna come could be a bit ""rude""? I'm afraid that she wanna come here for sex and I would not offer that for her, or she would gives me signs that I would not catch. (Since she would come with her friend, I guess there is a less chance for bed?)If I 'm going to have sex with her, I don't want her to think that I'm looking for a long-term relationship with her(not because I don't like her, she is cute and I like her personality but I just don't want it for now)So tell me what to do, should I just accept her request and travel together?Thank you and have a nice day. \--- \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : Just what do you think is the reason for that girl to come, long-term relationship? or just some kind of a hook-up.","It usually means that the girl is interested in spending time alone with you."
"537","I 24M have a ghosting problem with the person 23F in currently dating with, or at least i thought so","So three weeks ago I met this 23-year-old girl on Instagram. We met and spoke on the phone for about a week and there was a lot of synergy between us, so we decide to meet on Saturday. That same day he starts ghosting me and I don't hear from him again for a whole week. A week later she writes me apologizing for her behavior but she had had problems with her ex in that week, I tell her that there are no problems but that something like this should never happen again. Then we talk again and meet last Tuesday for lunch. In that moment we are really good, we tell you many sweet things and the intention is to move it forward. We still arrange to go to the cinema together on Saturday to see Scream 6. So much so that she stays up at night to catch up on all the other Screams. On Saturday itself, a few hours before the cinema, he wrote to me: “Forgive me but I don't feel like going out tonight, I'll tell you a little in advance but I'm sorry but I really don't feel like it. You haven't done anything wrong, but I realize I'm not ready for a new relationship. I don't want to waste any more of your time, I hope you understand” and blocks me on whatsapp, Instagram and tiktok without giving me the opportunity to reply. I am dazed for a moment and try to write to her via sms and then on Telegram, telling her to explain what was happening to understand. She replies: ""leave me alone"" and then ""forgive me but it's not a good time, I'm sorry"". I was very, very hurt and now it's been almost a week since the last contact and I'm not sure what to do because I can't stop thinking about her and that maybe something other than the simple ""I'm not ready"" may have happened because it's really strange behavior as far as I've known her. What should I do?TLDR: The girl i really like decided to block me out of the blue and i don’t know what to do"," Ghosting could be caused by a number of things. It could be that the person you're ghosting is not worth your time, or that you simply don't feel the same way about them. Whatever the case may be, it's important to take a step back and assess why you're avoiding this person. If you can't come to a resolution, it may be best to end things between you two."
"538","Is my (27f) boyfriend (27m) being abusive?","We’ve been together 4 years. When the relationship started we had agreed on the “traditional wife-patriarchal head of family” type of relationship. Which basically meant that I had to listen to him on everything and really work hard on improving my looks and in return he’ll take care of me in every way (we don’t live together right now but he said he’ll take care of me financially if we get married). Initially things were going great, he was helping me out with improving my looks by helping me upgrade my wardrobe and I was listening to all the advice he gave about what haircuts I could get etc. Fast forward to 2023, I’ve learnt a lot about clothing, hair and makeup that I don’t need his help anymore and right now I would say I look pretty good. The problem is that no matter how much I improve in my looks it’s never enough for my boyfriend, he says he wants me to be drop dead gorgeous but I’m no where close to that. We had a huge fight on 8th march, I went to a salon to colour my hair without his permission and he blew up over it, he said I broke his faith in me by disobeying him. I apologised and begged for another chance and he forgave me after a couple of days. We had another huge fight today. He called me when I was in the gym and he said I should leave immediately and go back home. When I asked why he said it’s not my place to ask him for a reason I have to listen blindly to what he says. I got angry and hung up. I didn’t leave and continued with my workout as usual. When I came home he called to say that this was a test to prove my loyalty and obedience to him and that I failed. That by disobeying him I was being incredibly selfish. He kept saying that I should count my stars that he took a leap of faith when he decided to start dating me when I was ugly and I am selfish for not listening to him with blind faith. I feel so guilty and think all this is my fault…..if I had just listened to him then we wouldn’t be fighting.I told my mom about these two fights and she’s saying he’s being abusive and controlling and if I continue with him this is going to get worse. TLDR; I got into a relationship with my boyfriend on the pretext that I will always listen to him and improve my looks , had two big fights when I disobeyed him and he is still dissatisfied with my appearance","It is not possible to answer this question definitively. Abusive behavior can vary dramatically from one person to the next, and can also be situational or sporadic. If you are concerned about your boyfriend's behavior, it is important to speak to him directly and explore the issue in greater depth."
"539","Fiancé (28 M) Cheated On Me (25 F) Online- wtf do I do??","Fiancé went on Omegle last night, send someone nudes, the person found him on Facebook and demanded he send money to them. He sent them 2k (!!) He called me this AM (I’m house sitting) and told me all this sobbing. He told me he has no idea why he did it, he fucked up, and he’s so sorry. That was on repeat for a while. I was so stunned I was just silent. Then he said he knew it was a scam, he knew what was happening but he was so scared and he just wanted it to go away. He said he actually called the police because he was so scared and didn’t know what to do.I have his email and this individual sent him a lot of emails so perhaps this was the rush to tell me, I don’t know.I had a surgery and have had a series of complications so we haven’t had seggsy time in a bit over a month. Not that this is an excuse (!!!!) but providing context as we literally just had a conversation last night of him essentially telling me he was horny and sad about it but recognizing my surgery.I’m sad, I’m angry, I slept about 2-3 hours last night and know that I’m not thinking straight. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m living in some stupid movie. Like who does this actually happen to? He’s not stupid, he knew he was being scammed! I’d be lying if I said that this wasn’t the first time he’d wandered in some fashion. We’ve had problems over our almost 10 years together. After the last set of problems, he saw a therapist which was really helpful to a lot of different facets of his life, and there wasn’t an incident that I’m aware of for a long time. We moved from that state and he didn’t find one here several years ago.Sorry for the rambling. I’m just dumbfounded. Nobody prepares you for these things. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what to say, I don’t know how to act. I essentially just stayed totally silent (shock) and then demanded I know all financial details (did I mention that we are BROKE- he started a new job and is on training pay for now which is shit and I’m out of a full time job after my surgery), because we have almost all joint bank accounts. Then I think he called my mother- who he has a good relationship with (…did…) because she’s our financial advisor essentially TLDR: fiance went online, sent nudes to a girl, girl blackmailed him for 2k, he called me sobbing and confessed this AM. Fuck.","Dear Fiancee,I'm so sorry that you've been cheated on. It sounds like you're feeling heartbroken and betrayed.

Now we broke up, she decided to move to another country with her daughter and I want to chase her, I want to stay with her and her daughter which I consider mine daughter also, I don't want to leave her and I cannot stop to think about how hard will be to move to another country and how hard will be for her alone, that's why I don't want to leave her or let her go and try to convince her to stay here.I broke up with my gf 2 months ago, we didn't talk much, some chat and I was always starting the combo, I said I miss her and I miss her daughter, I said I trust in we can fix the things somehow.The other day she told me she will move to another country, she has visa to go there already and she is just awaiting for the visa for the kid, she didn't propose officially to come with her or nothing, she just said she would like to have me there with her.I want to go with her and her kid, but stay with her means no sex, no dates or no love as I wanted or expected, but I really love her kid and I don't want leave her, I know the live will be super hard in another country, specially if we don't have money anymore, she said: Do what you want, I will go there.So I feel she doesn't care if I go or leave, or she doesn't want to tell me, but I want to go because of her kid, kinda my kid, I don't want to leave her, all this 2 months without her I remember both of her every single day, I'm sleeping less, I cannot focus on job thinking about her, I really want to do, but I need to convince myself to accept this life, I cannot quit again as I did now, I cannot leave her.I need advice, should I leave her at all or how to forget her, I know all the time even when she will leave I will keep thinking about her and about her kid.How can I know I will not regret the decision to chase her or leave her, I just wanted to be happy with her, have a family, I don't want to finish this, I cannot allow myself,  I don't want to leave this kid, I cannot do it.Some advices would be great, I'm totally lost, my family doesn't support me and looks like my gf doesn't care or idk...I'm totally lost","you can't do both! If your ex moves to another country, you can't just stay behind and be with her - you'd have to move too.

Recently he has been avoiding me and ignoring me because he feels I'm taking him for granted and and it's always him who initiates conversations. And him only who drives the conversation. If he won't step up and take charge of conversation our conversation falls flat. While i know where he is coming from, and i understand sometimes i fall silent in between conversations, but that doesn't mean i don't appreciate him and his efforts, i  have a lot of feelings for him and i love him so much but it becomes difficult for me to express my feelings to him sometimes. Even during at the initial of the relationship. I had major communication issues, and it was a constant topic during our disagreements too. But we had our way around it and resolved our conflicts with ease. But now after 3 years he says, he has given up over the fact that there is even a scope of improvement in me and my ability to understand him. He also says he now has 0 expectations from me and will now be putting 0 efforts going forward. I know i fucked up. But i just don't know how to improve myself.

I loved each and everytime he used to call, I'm so giddy with joy whenever I see his name flash across my screen.  It's just that i sometimes am not engaging in conversations. I become passive and just like to listen to me him. Please help me how to bridge in this gap between us. Because i honestly don't know what i am doing wrong.Tldr: My boyfriend says i suck at communication, and it's high time he should stop investing effort in me and have 0 expectations from me as this has drained him dry.","It sounds like your boyfriend may feel taken for granted. One way to show him that you really do care and love him is to communicate with him more effectively. Make sure that you are clear about your feelings and intentions, and be open to hearing from him about what he needs and wants from the relationship. If you can resolve the communication issues, you will both be more likely to enjoy your relationship."

( I have a girlfriend obviously)Recently i entered a new job and i got to know a HR coordinator, basically she walk me through the whole process of getting into the company. She was really kind to me genuinely and was going on about that I was really smart and good for the position, after 3 different interviews I got the job and i was really happy. This woman that we can call "" K "" she messages me through WhatsApp, and we started a friendly conversation, but then she started to say that i was really handsome and she liked me, and instead of stopping her I listened to her and make some comments myself like she was cute too and flirted a little like 3 messages in this tone.

He complains about his parents, his pets, everything about his job, his apartment. He’s complaining about like little things that we all have to do like buying furniture or going to the store. We go on dates together but there are things he refuses to do. He won’t dance. He won’t go to concerts. He doesn’t really like comedies but he’ll watch them when I do.

We only had met once before (in my home state 3 months ago, before I moved) and he put that much effort just to hangout with me again, yet these guys on apps expect me to make a whole 45 minute commute just for coffee? Not to mention, the guy who visited me took me out on a lot of nice dates (I took turns paying for some too) but we always went to nice restaurants or dessert spots, so being taken out to Starbucks honestly sounds pretty boring in comparison.

I’m currently waiting for an appointment with general surgery so I can’t do physical activity that will make it worse right now. He’s been threatening me with divorce the last few months whenever I wouldn’t do what he wants me to do. I admit I don’t clean as much as I should due to my health issues and adhd. But he doesn’t help clean either stating it’s my mess not his. We don’t have kids just a dog. But tonight he sent me a text stating I have to start exercising daily. I have to respect him and his ideals. I have to listen to him and take action when he speaks. If I argue with him he will take it as our marriage is over. He says I haven’t been trying to improve myself but I’ve been working on my mental health. Eating better. I started my own business as a side hustle. I went to the doctors and got diagnosed with health issues and I’ve been following doctors plan of care to take care of myself. I feel as those these podcasts he listens to have convinced him a wife is supposed to be a blow up sex doll who takes care of every need. When we aren’t arguing I do love him. I just wish he would listen and talk to me instead of making demands and ultimatums. I have friends who have offered to let me rent with them in June I just don’t know what to do.TD;LR my husband is acting different and I don’t know whether to stay and work it out or leave.","?Depends on the situation."
"551","I (23m) have no idea what even happening with my gf(21f)","I have no idea really what’s happeningFor the past year my girlfriend (21f)every other day accuses me(23m) of talking to someone else and tells me to screen share while on FaceTime and searches my phone I’ve told her when these things happened that I really feel like she doesn’t trust me and she just kept telling me that if I had nothing to hide than it shouldn’t be a problem and I definitely see the logic I’m that statement so each time even though i tell her every time it makes me feel like she doesn’t trust me she says the same things. It went all the way up until right now I told her I will no longer be indulging in her random searches because I’m at my breaking point with feeling like she’ll never trust me. She went on to say that she won’t do it anymore but she now feels uncomfortable being intimate with me because she feels her body is more private to her than a phone. So if we are putting a restriction on the phones she doesn’t feel right in showing her body. She said that she believed this was an open relationship but if we’re now being private with our phones now she reserves the right to be private with her body(again that’s her choice and I will not force her to do anything with her body) but I feel that she’s just being dismissive of my feelings.Tl:dr I told my girlfriend that I was uncomfortable with her constant phone searches and she in turn said she was gonna be less intimate making me feel like she’s just dismissing my feelings","You might not be able to communicate with your girlfriend or understand what is going on with her. You should try talking to her and getting to know what is going on. Sometimes things can get confusing when two people are in a relationship."
"552","Is it possible to have a youthful free-spirited romance at 27?","I've never had a girlfriend and I am almost 30. I missed out on the youthful and adventurous romance a lot of 16, 19, and 21 year old people got to have.Is it in theory possible to have a romantic relationship with a person my age where we can just have fun? No pressure of getting married. No pressure of having kids.Can I have a romance where the only goal is to have fun together? Because that's all I want to do right now given how much I have missed out on my life. I honestly don't want to think about marriage for the next 10 years.I want to have fun. I want those adventurous romances I just never got the opportunity in having. I resent the idea that in just year 3 a person my age wants to bring up marriage.This is the reason I prefer dating someone slightly younger.You think it's possible for me to have a relationship like I am describing? Or maybe it's time to accept that romantic relationships will never be in the cards.TLDR; Is it possible to have the type of romances I missed out on as a young adult as I am in my late 20s now?","You can definitely have a youthful free-spirited romance at 27! However, it may not be easy. It takes a lot of work and effort to maintain a passionate and committed relationship at this age, but it is definitely possible."
"553","Should I F27 break up with my M33 boyfriend just because of no sex?","Should we break up?Should I break up with my boyfriend (34M)  of 3 years. If so, how? I (27F) n a loving relationship, for 3 years. The first year, sex was great. The last 2 years, we've been having sex less and less. Now we only do it once every 4-6 weeks, and it's quite boring and routine. We communicate really well, and talk through disagreements pretty quickly.  we have great friends, both our families get on well, he has a daughter, who I consider my step daughter. currently they're 10 years old, and we have a great relationship.We share some similar hobbies and and respect each others different interests. Finances are shared equally based on a percentage of earnings, so not 50/50 unfairly. We have pet cats together. Our chores are equally taken care of, and there's never any fuss over who does what. Besides the sex, it seems like we're the perfect couple and have talked about getting married, and having kids together. But I feel like I'm not completely happy, and am just settling for and easy, but not overly fulfilling life.I know how good I have it, and feel awful for wanting more. We love each other dearly, but there's no excitement. When we aren't working or with friends, we mostly just watch TV together snuggled in the sofa.We rarely passionately even make out, our kisses are mostly gentle pecks, as hes grown a beard, and says kissing now feels wierd.He has taken care of me and supported me through so much, at times when I've been in debt, he has patiently helped me, looks after me when I am sick, and when I have struggled with work while I decided a new career path. How do you break up from such a loving relationship with a really nice person?TL;DR Should I break up from my more or less perfect loving relationship besides a lack of sex?","There is no one definitive answer to this question. If you're not having sex with your M33 boyfriend and you're not happy with that, then it may be worth considering breaking up with him. However, it's important to remember that sex is not the only important thing in a relationship; relationships are also based on trust, love, and communication. If you and your M33 boyfriend are able to maintain those things and continue to have other positive aspects of your relationship, then it may be worth sticking around."
"554","My (37) coworker/roommate's (33) daughter (14) asked me to go out with her mother","It's a complicated situation but last year I helped my coworker (Alina) escape from her abusive marriage. Alina and her daughter (Elise) currently live with me and the bastard is awaiting trial. While Alina is back in control of her finances and everything she wasn't fully ready to live alone yet, so I've been supporting them. I've actually gotten along pretty well with Elise, she's a great kid. It's Alina's birthday soon so I took Elise out to pick a surprise gift. While we were out she said that I should be with Alina instead of her Dad, and basically told me to ask her out for her birthday. While I've been getting close to Elise, I definitely didn't expect this. I kinda laughed it off and told her that her mum's amazing and strong as she is. That the last thing she needs is the drama of a relationship, least of all with me. Elise didn't take it especially well and has been really upset with me. Since then she's essentially refused to talk with me and acts all sulky. I haven't told Alina about what happened, she's just assumed Elise is just being moody over everything again. I didn't mean to upset her or anything. It wasn't meant to insult her or Alina, they're both so strong with everything they've been through. I have Asperger's so I'm not great at knowing what to say in these situations. I know I probably worded it wrong and not sure what to do now. What should I do here to clear it up and fix things with Elise?Tl;dr- I've helped my coworker get out of her abusive marriage. Her daughter told me to ask her mum out and I tried to politely decline. She's taken it poorly and is really upset with me."," (38)This is a difficult question to answer. Your coworker's daughter is very young, so it's unclear what she would want from the relationship. Your coworker's daughter might be looking for a relationship with someone her own age, or she might just want your company. It's difficult to say what your coworker's daughter's expectations are, and it's also difficult to say if she would be happy if you agreed to go out with her mother."
"555","How can i (F 19) kindly tell my boyfriend (M 19) he needs to present himself better?","How can i kindly tell my boyfriend he should present himself better? My boyfriend is a very handsome guy but he doesn’t always take care of himself. For starters he’s got long curly hair that he refuses to cut or at least trim and he never combs  it. I have no issue with the length of his hair, i just wish he would comb it or use products in it to make it less frizzy. I’ve even bought him the products he needs and have shown him how to use it but he won’t do it. The only clothes he wears is tshirts and sweatpants, which again is fine in most situations but he wears them 24/7. I don’t think he owns any jeans or nicer shorts or pants. The only thing i’ve ever seen him wear is basketball shorts, hoodies, tshirts, and sweats. Even when he met my parents he wore very baggy sweatpants and a hoodie.I’ve offered to go shopping with him for clothes but he doesn’t want to. I honestly don’t care how he looks but i just wish that sometimes he would take better care of himself. We’ve been together since we were 17. At first i thought it would get better with age but it hasn’t. I know he’s still a young guy and this is somewhat normal but if anything it’s gotten worse . Whenever i ask him why he won’t try out some new clothes or something he just says he wants to be comfy. It’s to the point where my parents won’t take him seriously because every single time they’ve seen him he’s been wearing sweats and a t-shirt or hoodie. The last thing i want to do is hurt his feelings.How do i approach this nicely?TLDR: My boyfriend never takes pride in how looks or puts in any effort no matter the occasion. How do i approach this topic kindly?","There is no specific answer to this question, as it would depend on the specific situation and relationship between the two people involved. In general, though, one option might be to suggest that he try to be more responsible and present himself in a more positive light, both to himself and to other people. Alternatively, you could encourage him to seek professional help if he feels that his presentation is impacting his relationships adversely."

I’d hate to ruin the friendship we have by bringing any of this upTL;DR I have a crush on a very old friend and I think he likes me back but I am scared of ruining the friendship if I am perceiving things wrong"," for each other?It is unclear exactly what you are asking, but presumably you are wondering what you should do about your friend's feelings for you.

It can be difficult to differentiate between a mental health issue and a relationship issue. It is possible that your boyfriend's break up is due to a mental health issue, but it is also possible that the break up is due to some other issue.

"558","I want to reconnect with my childhood friend, but can’t seem to find him anywhere? Help?","So I’m 22f and I’ve felt nostalgic recently over my childhood days. I’ve reached out to some of my old friends from elementary/middle school. Some of them I’ve already had on social media since many years ago. Others I searched up online and added them. There’s this one guy in particular though (21m) that I’ve searched up everywhere and I can’t find him. Me and him were close friends in 2008-2009, when we were both about 7-8 years old. My mom was friends with his mom and she used to babysit him after school and during the summers, so me and him used to see each other almost everyday. Eventually we just grew apart. Now, I’ve tried searching him up, but I can’t find him on any social media. Could he just not have social media? It’s hard to believe that someone in their early 20’s would choose to not have any social media at all, especially in this day and age. I found his mom and dad’s Facebook pages, and they’ve posted pictures of him and the rest of their family throughout the years. What’s weird was that the last picture they posted of him was in late 2020. From there, they haven’t posted him anymore. How could I find my old friend?Tl;dr: tried searching up my old friend on social media but can’t find him anywhere, his parents haven’t posted any pics of him since 2020.","It's possible that your childhood friend has changed his or her name, or moved. If you can't find him online, it's worth trying to reach out to old friends and family members to see if they have any information. If you still can't find him, it's worth considering that he may not want to be found, and you should move on."
"559","my friends ignored my birthday and I feel not being respected","My close friends ignored my birthday and I feel very disrespectedOne year ago I formed a group of friends with 4 people (2 boys, 2 girls) from the place we all started to attend to at the time. Since then we were hanging out often, went on holiday together. I was always there for them to help them with anything, to solve conflicts, find a job, take care od them. We celebrated birthday of each person by planning a surprise party weeks ahead, buying presents and some special custom birthday cake etc. I must admit I was never the main organiser, but I always gave ideas for the gifts and was very enthusiastic for birthdays. Finally, my 25th birthday came to be celebrated last. All I got from them were text messages from the girls. Guys didn't even say a single word. I feel sad about it. :(My birthday date is available on Facebook and we have a shared online calendar for birthdays.I didn't expect much, but I think as an equal group member, it would be plain courtesy, to just meet at that day (not even as surprise) and just sing happy birthday. Anything extra would be to purposedly make me happy.Two weeks earlier one friend had his birthday and it was tone of effort to organise it. Just by comparison, skipping my birthday shows they don't really respect or care for me.I don't know what to do about it. I don't have many friends and it is difficult to find new ones, so I don't want to cut them off. I quite enjoy spending time together. I don't even have parents or girlfriend, so I feel very lonely.I don't want to talk to them about it, because that would be awkward. I don't believe there could be any specific reason to miss it other than them not caring enough. Maybe something is wrong with me, maybe I haven't form a strong enough bond with them.What do you think? What should I do?TL;DR My birthday was completly ignored whereas the rest of the group had cool surprise parties.","If your friends ignored your birthday, that may not feel very respectful to you. While it may not be the most intimate thing they could do, it doesn't mean they don't care about you. If they had known and wanted to celebrate with you, they would have done so. You may feel like they don't care about you, but that could just be because you don't feel particularly cared for."
"560","Guy friend is interested in texting me daily but avoids in-person plans","I (19f) met him (20m) a year ago in a university zoom tutoring session and there was an instant connection when we talked to each other that I had never felt with anyone before. He asked for my discord, and ever since then, we have been chatting with each other constantly. The problem is that our friendship does not feel fulfilling due to the disconnect of it being situated entirely online.Whenever I try to ask him about hanging out, he always diverts the conversation or makes up excuses as to why he can't make it last minute. I found that he doesn't do this kind of behavior with his other friends and it seems to be an issue with me only. The most we'll do is call on a somewhat frequent basis, but he never wants to show his face.He has always come off as a very private person, as he doesn't like to talk much about his personal life. I know that he has some trauma from his past friendships, particularly with girls, but he has barely brought it up. Nevertheless, he is extremely sweet, caring, and is always a great listener when I want to talk or vent about whatever.From the start, this relationship has been in a strange spot. He confessed his feelings for me only a couple weeks into us knowing each other, and I honestly did not know how to respond. Not long after I started to develop them back as well. We never attempted dating, but it was clear that what was going on wasn't completely platonic. The few times we actually hung out irl, he kept hugging me and we held hands. We would flirt all the time for months and I didn't even feel weird about it.This stopped after the last time we were hanging out in-person last November, but all the regular communication hasn't. He'll always initiate convos with me and this goes on to hundreds of messages each day. It has become so ingrained into my daily routine that I can't imagine not doing it at this point. I have no idea what to think anymore.tl;dr: Guy friend is interested in texting with me everyday but is aversive to doing any non-virtual activities, making the relationship feel incomplete.","There could be a lot of reasons why your friend would be avoiding in-person plans with you, but one possibility is that they're not interested in spending time with you in that way. If this is the case, it's possible that they'd rather communicate with you via text instead. However, if your friend does want to meet in person, it's important that you try to schedule a time slot that works for both of you."

Anyways, she happens to be in ROTC for our school, so she had the option to go to the military ball with a plus one. She asked me to go with her, I think because I'm her only male friend. I said yes of course and had everything signed so we could go. The ball is in about two weeks and she told me today that her dad wants to meet me and talk to me. I'm terrified of what might happen. I've seen in movies in stuff when the girls dad always intimidates the boy, and it's even worse thinking that he may not particularly favor the idea of his daughter dating a white boy. If he asks, I'd like to hear some tips on how I might answer the following questions.1: ""What are your intentions with my daughter?""Obviously, I have a crush on his daughter and want to be with her, but I can't just say that.2: ""Do you want to have sex with my daughter?""I'm a teenage boy, it's crossed my mind. Should I be honest?3: ""Do you want to date my daughter?""Again, yes, but I don't wanna say that.Any help at all would be much appreciated!TL;DR: Meeting my crush's dad soon, need to know how I should answer if he asks sensitive questions.","There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best thing to say depends on the relationship between you and the father of your female friend.

"562","Moving in…","Hello. Recently my boyfriend (34m) and I (26f) have been talking about me potentially moving in down the line, around the 5-6 month mark of dating. As we’ve had very honest conversations about finances, chores, and expectations of living together, and even what to do about wanting alone time, I felt very confident it was a good decision. I’ve even discussed it at length with my therapist who agrees this is easily the healthiest relationship I’ve ever experienced, and my boyfriend is very much a keeper. We both however also think it’s logical to have an ‘out’ so to speak to keep pressure off the relationship. At any time I could move out very easily, and as it’s his owned home so there isn’t a leasing issue involved. The trouble comes in when we mentioned me potentially getting a puppy. He has a stay at home job and is happy to watch the dog along with his own, and I’d be taking time off to help get it settled. Neither of us saw an issue with this, as in his eyes it’s as if I’m just moving in with a dog in the first place.Other people outside of the relationship though have expressed reasonable doubts regarding how fast this is going, and it’s making me nervous. I know I want to spend more time with him, as it is I spend over half the week at his home already. We have little disagreements here and there but I love how we can communicate and work through them, mostly because we both see where the other is coming from even if we don’t hold the same beliefs.At the end of the day we share common goals of kids, marriage, having dogs, and even both have the same general beliefs regarding religion and politics.It’s not perfect, and I’m not expecting it to ever be, but things are uncompromisingly safe. I do love him, but I am wondering what other people’s experience is with moving in jitters?TL;DR Talking about potentially moving in at around six months and started feeling a little nervous after other people started doubting our timeline on things. I’m already spending more than half the week there as it is. Is this common?","In order to move in, you will need to provide the following:- Documentation that proves you are qualified to live in the United States (e.g. your resume, baptismal certificate)- Copy of your passport- Furniture and household goods- eviction notice (if you have one)- Proof of insurance- Credit score"
"563","Is she going through the motions?","I (40m) and my girlfriend (47f) have had problems for a while - see my other posts.Now, I feel like she’s putting in an effort to make things work. She’ll come to me, she’ll hold my hand, she’ll text me if I want to watch something with her.She’ll go through the motions.I feel like she’s not being sincere, there’s a distrust and even a hatred underneath the surface which doesn’t take much to pry out.If I go to kiss her sometimes she’ll tell me to watch the show or if I touch her she’ll call me a sex pest. On the other hand, every few days she’ll let us have sex and say she loves me.My gut is telling me she’s trying to make it an easy life because leaving would be logistically and financially difficult for her. I want to believe she’s genuine but I don’t feel she loves me like she used to do. I feel like she is waiting until she’s in a better position to leave. Fundamentally, I feel like she cares a lot less than I do.Basically the reality of her life post divorce has set in and I’m responsible in her world. She’s said a few times she just wishes she could wipe out the past.What do I do? I really want to believe I’m wrong and so far I’ve been going through the motions too hoping she was being genuine. But every now and then, like in the examples I gave - something about her actions is jarring, and I’m unable to hide my feelings and she calls me weird.TL/DR I can’t get past the feeling that my girlfriend doesn’t feel about me the same way she used to due to life post divorce.

"564","Online ""relationship"" ending after less than a month, How can I communicate better and meet partners needs? 30sF/40sM","Tl;drHow can I communicate better if he gives me another chance? I'm not a good communicator. I'm not inept at carrying a conversation by any means, but I struggle with sharing I guess. So for instance, a ""how was your day?"" Could be something like, ""it was okay! I had a good day.""But I know it should be more like, ""it was good, I had a good day. Insert things that happened today."" I'm hating on myself for throwing this away. He was very nice and said that I'm unhealthy for him. (The relationship with me is unhealthy). Because I'm not meeting his needs. He wanted to be there for me (something that hasn't really ever been offered before) and I didn't go to him. I even pathetically asked him if we could still be friends. He said emotionally, that wasn't healthy for him. He also pointed out that I was asking for me, not him. Maybe I was. I'm not sure. I enjoyed him a lot. I guess I was already envisioning a future. I was super excited to meet him. And every time my phone dinged, I'd get excited. But I didn't communicate well enough. And honestly, that makes me feel awful for him. I feel lonely. Empty even. Which is, full circle, probably how I made him feel. I don't think he will ever speak to me again... but if he would, (I know.... pipe dream.) what are some ways I can ensure that im sharing enough, but not too much? And just talking about life in general. Do you just text your partner what you're thinking? Or like, if I see something that I think is funny just send a pic in the middle of the day? I'm a little nervous that my rambling will scare ppl away. Or what I share will seem pointless? I'm not used to a partner wanting to know how I feel in depth. My life is so lonely, and yet, I'm the reason it's that way because I let my past experiences dictate how high my walls are.Most men only want me for one thing... and he hardly mentioned that. Which was so nice. I really messed up. I wish I could text him a million random things right now. But I think he's probably blocked me on every platform. And I promised him I wouldn't be clingy, or needy, or crazy if we broke it off. If he does reach out, what are things I can do to save this? How can I share more without worrying about oversharing? Should I get in the mind set of making my partner happy with all the talking? I want him happy. I just wish I could have been better when I still had him.","A possible communication solution for you could be to set up a boundary for the relationship. This could mean setting up rules such as limiting communication to agreed-upon topics, times, and locations. Additionally, it might be helpful to communicate your needs and desires in a clear and concise way. It can be helpful to connect with mutual friends and meet other potential partners in order to get a better understanding of what they are interested in and looking for in a relationship."

He was cruel, manipulative and didn’t want to be a better person.I love my son and have always given him love and affection and raised him well. My boyfriend is also a good parent but my son often says he’s not his ‘real dad’. Alongside this my son is cold to his little sister that I have with my boyfriend and still is openly rude about him.I’ve gotten complaints of him being violent and a bully at school and have even had to pay for smashed property. He breaks things, gets into fights, name calls and is just an awful bully.I’m terrified he’s too much like his biological father as he looks like him which I could deal with, I’ll always love him, it’s now his actions, the cruelty that just remind me too much of his biological father. It gives me a feeling I shouldn’t have when talking to him he just reminds me too much of him in the way he acts paired with his looks it makes me uncomfortable. Am I a bad mother? I feel awful for admitting this and would never say to anyone in real life but online I still feel awful. What do I do?","It sounds like your son could be taking after your ex husband, who may have exhibited signs of being a sociopath. If you are concerned about this, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist who can help you explore the roots of your anxiety and feelings of fear. Additionally, you can try to build a close relationship with your son and talk to him about your concerns. Additionally, you may want to consider getting some help to deal with your own fear and anxiety."
"567","I 25F have been giving my boyfriend 33M of 8 months up to 1K but he is now acting selfish when I need the money back","I am 25F he is 33M we have been in a relationship for 8 month. We have great chemistry, he makes me laugh which I think is very important, I feel save when with him, he can cook and overall we can talk about everything.However, early on in the relationship he has been asking for financial support.It started with 200 I didn’t give it then and he said it was only a test. We had a little argument about it and he promised not to ask again to maintain the peace.Fast forward he asked for 300 which I gave him as it was an emergency he said. After that it was 200, then 100, then 1000 then 150.When I have the 1000 I was hesitant and told him I would need it the following month. He promised he would give it. Last month which was when he was supposed to give it back he said he had to use it to set up something for his son (he has a son from a woman that is now married but he was not in the sons life originally and now wants to be involved so he is setting court things and stuff). Now is March and it’s when he was supposed to pay me back. I told him I urgently needed it back because I had many expenses this month. I when I told him he said “next month” because apparently he has some kind of debt of 4k he has to pay.Now this guy makes 2k + a month. Has paid his rent for a year in advance so I was so upset when he said that because it’s like he is being selfish to my needs. Last time we went on a date I had to pay because he had “no money” qnd after the date he still asked me 200 as a gift to go out with his friends.He says he loves me and all and his parents know about me but I can’t help the fact that he seems selfish he knows I have my own expenses and keeps asking.I spoke to him about this and all and he doesn’t seem to get it. He has tried to make it up other ways by cooking for me and dropping me where I need but still the issue remains. Can’t help but feel used.He says he sees me as his wife etcc I do love him and want to help but I am scared of what will be in the future. He had cancer a year ago so that’s why he had the debt.I would like some advice on how I should face this situation as I do love him and don’t want to loose him but also don’t want to be in a relationship where I am not considered.TDLR; F25 been dating 33M for 8 months but he keeps asking for money despite having a good job.","If your boyfriend is being selfish and refusing to give you back the money you've given him, he may not be interested in continuing this arrangement. suggester Talk to your boyfriend about why he's not giving you the money back and see if there's a way to compromise. Maybe he can give you a smaller percentage of the money each month, or he can give you the entire amount back at once. If he's unwilling to compromise, it might be better to end the relationship."
"568","Why do I(16F) have a crush on a guy(16M) who's personality is trash and not really physically attractive","We share a class together this year and we shared 2 classes last year, but barely knew each other. At first I thought he was a pretty cool guy since we shared the same interests like anime. But the more the school year went on, I learned more about him, some things were positive, but most of the info that came from my friends about him was really negative. I'm not even allowed to say it on reddit or this post will be removed, but he had a lot of controversial opinions, some of them were pretty gross. So my friends are telling me to stop being friends with this guy, and over the course of the week for some reason, I may have developed a crush. Like why??? It doesn't even make sense, because I know if we dated, he would be a pretty gross boyfriend, maybe cheat, not really care about my feelings. And other people said he was a lolicon. He probably does really nasty stuff when he's home alone just based off what he says a lot. I honestly think he would be a terrible boyfriend. He's also not very physically attractive. I mean on a scale of one to ten, he's probably a 6.5. His looks are really average. He wears a mask most of the time, but when he took it off, he did not look any better(sorry). I mean not many guys actually talk to me because they want to, so maybe it could be that I'm just desperate? Like I don't really want to ghost him(which my friends are telling me to do) not just because I'd feel guilty, but I like talking to him and one of the few guys that I can kind of naturally talk to. Not only that, I was actually kind of talking bad about him too secretly just because a lot of the things he said in class were pretty weird. But then afterwards I would stop, because I would feel guilty about gossiping about this guy to my friends. So why did I do that if I have a crush on him? I don't know, is this even a crush? Or am I just confused? Should I even hold onto this crush? TL;DR Me(16F) recently likes a guy(16M) who isn't attractive in any way. The guy is pretty gross and has controversial opinions. But somehow, I like him after learning all that. I may need advice.","?There could be any number of reasons why you may have a crush on a guy who has a personality that is considered to be trash and who is not particularly physically attractive. It could be that you find him to be funny or interesting, or that you find him to be charming. whatever the reason, it is important to remember that YOU are the only person who can decide whether or not you find someone attractive. If you are happy with who you are and who your crush is, then that is all that matters."
"569","Couples Counselling at end of 8 year relationship"," I (40m) have recently separated from my partner (43f). Our relationship was 8 years long. We live together with our 5 year old son in the house we jointly own.  In general it has been happy, but we have had our issues, traumas and crisis along the way. Communication has always been something we could have done better. I am absolutely devastated and fearful of the future.She reluctantly agreed to attend couples counselling.We had an initial joint session, which was very hard as I said I wanted to see if reconciliation was possible. She stated that instead of wanting to work on aspects of our relationship, she wants to focus on separation mediation.She had her individual session the other day. Mine is scheduled for next week. She has since set out that we could continue to do family things together but live apart. I don’t think I’m comfortable with this, I think it would be very painful.I’m not sure I need a counsellors assistance to read the writing on the wall. her messages outside of counselling have made it clear that there is no future together.**Is there any benefit in carrying on with this counselling?**&#x200B;&#x200B;TLDR: Separated from partner of 8 years, 5yo child. She sees counselling as sep mediation. Is it worth it?","At the end of an 8 year relationship, there is usually a lot of mixed feelings. Whether you are the one who is ending the relationship or the one who is left, it can be a difficult time.Couples Counselling can help you process your feelings and understand why your relationship ended. You can also explore what you want from the future, and how to create a lasting relationship."
"570","I (26M) am tired of my (26f) GF crying wolf, but am also scared of being wrong","Been with my GF for 5 years now, things are serious, planning on proposing later this year. Things are great between her and I, but she’s got a serious issue with seemingly becoming sick before big events with my family and friends, and it’s becoming a dealbreaker. In the last year, she cancelled day before on a wedding that we were supposed to go to, and I went alone. She also claimed she was sick for an event with a large group of my friends, and New Years Eve as well as she was sick. She’s afraid to visit my place and spend time with my family (we both still live with our families), and now, with my sisters baby shower this week, she’s claiming she’s coming down with something and doesn’t know if she’ll go. To her credit, she doesn’t miss everything, but it’s frequent enough to notice a pattern. Between her and I, things are okay, but I don’t believe her, and at the same time would feel awful if I was wrong, but my family and friends don’t really like my gf because it seems like I’m always making excuses for things she doesn’t want to go to. I just find it hard to believe she’s always sick right when something big is coming up, and my family has outright told me they don’t like her because of that, and my mother has said she won’t support me getting married to her if she keeps skipping out on big family things. Obviously I’m a grown man, and my family’s opinion of who I do and don’t date is more an annoyance than anything else, but I’m tired of covering for her when I myself don’t believe she wants to come to these events, and I’ve already discussed with her that it cannot be she gets sick every time some event comes up. If I’m wrong I’m acting like a jerk, which I agree with, but it feels like a boy who cried wolf situation. I’m trying to be sympathetic to the situation, but at this point I can’t be. In this specific situation, I told her if she’s doing that bad she should go to a dr, and she refuses to. Should I just tell her the truth that my family, who she asks whether they like her or not a lot, would be really mad if she didn’t go to the shower? I don’t want to do this back and forth anymore.TL;DR: my GF tends to get sick around big family/friend events and she’s already saying she’s sick before my sisters baby shower this week.","Tired of your GF crying wolf and scared of being wrong."
"571","The spell has been broken","TL;DR: Used to be heavily attached to my wife but not anymore (hopefully)Me (M32) and my wife (W30) have been married for 4 years now, we have a 3 year old daughter. Since the beginning of the relationship she was clearly the one with the power, if things didn't go her way, she would just say that she might just leave me. I was so attached to her that sometimes I would cry asking her for forgiveness even when I did nothing wrong, just to be ok with her.Recently she opened my phone and saw a chat I had with a coworker (W30), there was nothing bad in that chat, just a friendly casual conversation, for reference I don't talk to her often, I don't talk to any women on a daily basis, just the casual morning chat since I work from home.She immediately sent me a message telling me that she would cheat on me but we will remain as a couple for our daughters sake and that I if I didn't agreed to this she would just leave.The most impressive thing after that was that I no longer felt attachment, a year ago I i would have cried, begging her for mercy. Not that day, I told her I didn't wouldn't want to be married to an unfaithul wife. Since then (2 weeks ago), she has been mean to me at times and some other times she is just nice.What should I do now? I feel like a castaway that just found land for the first time in 4 years.","""The spell has been broken."
"572","I (F24) don’t know how to talk to my friend (F25) ever since she brushed me off when I opened up about possible PPD","My friend doesn’t have kids, but wants them. I have one child who is a year old. We live in different states, but have been best friends since high school. We were keeping in touch pretty often over text before I felt upset by this. I texted her on a day in late February where I was really struggling emotionally, saying “I think I might have postpartum depression or something.”She responds, “How?” And I say, “I don’t know, I just don’t feel like myself.” She texts back, “Could just be you being depressed? I mean I don’t know cause you be around (my child) a lot. And haven’t thought about killing her or yourself.”I just had no idea what to say to this. I guess the mention of wanting to kill my child really threw me off, and upset me, because yeah, I don’t feel that way, but that’s not the only symptom of PPD. I just texted back, “idk,” thinking that she would move on from that and ask me how I’m feeling instead. But all she said was, “Well I guess when you figure it out, let me know,” and then that was just it?Like I said, I was already very emotional on this day, so I just really did not know what to say after that. When I was younger, I had the tendency to lash out when someone upset me, so now to prevent that, I just distance myself to figure out how I feel and decide whether I’m overreacting or not. I’ve had her texts on mute since then. I just discovered that she sent a text on the 9th of March saying she was proud of me. I didn’t see it until today since I had her muted. I still don’t really know what to say. AM I overreacting by being upset by the way she responded? It’s not so much her not understanding PPD that really bothers me. It’s the “when you figure it out, let me know.” When I figure out what? I don’t know, it just seemed like a very flippant response to me. I just don’t really know what to think or how to talk to her about it, if it’s even worth it.TLDR: I don’t know how to react after feeling brushed off by my friend.","It may be difficult to approach your friend about PPD, given that she may have been brushed off when you opened up. Instead, you could try speaking with her privately to see if she would be receptive to discussing the issue. Alternatively, you could reach out to a support group or therapist for guidance on how to broach the topic with your friend."
