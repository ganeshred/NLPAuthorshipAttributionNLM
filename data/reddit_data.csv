"1","CMV: Demanding ""Asian people"" to have better grades than other ""races"" to be accepted to universities is inherently racist","Edit:I talk about the fact that Asian applicants need to get (statistically) higher SAT scores to get into Ivy League schools if it was not clear.https://nypost.com/2018/10/17/harvards-gatekeeper-reveals-sat-cutoff-scores-based-on-race/First, let me say it's just my initial opinion.I am not American, so I was surprised when I heard of it.I don't think I have ever seen a double standard worse than this idea.It divides people into race groups by definition (and race is just a fake generalization we invented & should be ignored, use social status or living areas instead if you want more fairness).Look, one of the proposed definitions of racism is:""of, relating to, or characterized by the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another.""Now, I see that diversity is celebrated in the USA, which is great, but I feel like people who think they understand why it's ok to give some groups an advantage or disadvantage in acceptance based on race, just spit things they read on Instagram and have no idea what racism is, which makes me perceive them as ignorant people who should not be taken seriously. Moreover, I am convinced this population (of people which I perceive as lacking critical thinking, i.e. celebrate diversity but encourage racism) can get brainwashed to be racist on more significant occasions, if it would come using the right politically correct terms, with the right delivery, from the right celebrity. Basically, a herd of sheep.If you think this way of enforcing diversity is acceptable, please change my view. I might be unaware of some ideas.",""
"2","CMV: Eating your lunch on the toilet is a disgusting habit.","I have a coworker who does this and it's pretty much his daily habit. He keeps a cafeteria style lunch tray in his office. Nearly every day at around noon, he set his lunch out on his tray, takes it into the bathroom, goes into one of the stalls, and does his business/eats lunch over the course of a half hour or so.I can see under the stall that he has his pants down too, so it's not like he's just sitting in the stall for isolation purposes (which would still be gross, in my opinion).This is not any sort of personal vendetta and I don't hate the guy. In fact, I otherwise like him. He is good at his job and always does his fair share of the work. In general, he comes across as a kind and generous person.But this habit of his is just plain disgusting.Eating food in the bathroom is disgusting. I could make a few small exceptions for cases where you already had a piece of hard candy (like a jolly rancher) in your mouth before walking in or something like that, but taking an actual meal in with you and eating while sitting on the toilet is unsanitary and unappetizing.",""
"3","cmv: I don’t see transwomen as women, but don’t yet fully understand the definition of women due to how people portray it in this generation.","Now, I don’t have any sort of hate towards transgender people, I’m just really confused here, I hope not offend anybody at all but here we go.I was born a woman, (or ciswoman??? I don’t know but I’d prefer woman) and I was raised as one, I’ve never questioned my gender, never felt like I had to work for it, never felt like it, I just… am. My personal view is that a woman is a biological human female. But I understand that apparently there are more definitions as such? A woman is someone who identifies as a woman? But that would imply that they know what one is? They identify as female even though… they aren’t?? It’s a sex…Right?If someone could explain it to me, I’d appreciate it. I’ve been called a transphobe for saying something along those lines before, but… ahI don’t know, if I AM being transphobic, please cmv.Edit: I get it now.",""
"4","CMV: there is nothing sinister or underhanded about ghost kitchens","I think ghost kitchens are just the inevitable next step in the way that food is prepared, it makes a lot more sense to have dozens of smaller companies sharing a kitchen instead of them all having their own, especially when catering for the delivery market specifically., It definitely streamlines the delivery process for the drivers and is more cost-effective and efficient overall and if the food is good, who cares where exactly it was, prepaired, ?I imagine the same thing will happen to banks eventually, instead of having lots of different banks they will all share a building and, you, would, be able to visit different areas of the building to access different banks, and although people might think that it’s strange I imagine people had similar reservations about the supermarket before it became as popular as it did.",""
"5","CMV: Megamind was morally justified in catfishing Roxanne Richie","Hey guys! Megamind is one of my favorite movies of all time, and over many rewatches, I’ve cultivated the opinion in the title. I can’t really blame Megamind for lying to Roxanne like he did. A few reasons come to mind:1. He originally didn’t intend to lie. He pretended to be someone else to covertly blow up the Metroman statue, and ended up rolling with it when he bonded with Roxanne. If he had set out with the intention of getting Roxanne to fall in love with him, that would change my view. 2. He was right when he said that his blue skin and distinctive appearance would ruin his romantic chances. To me, what Megamind did isn’t much morally different than someone getting plastic surgery and not revealing that history to suitors. I don’t think that’s wrong to do, either.3. Roxanne (nor anyone else) wouldn’t have bothered to learn what Megamind’s past and true personality were like if they knew they were talking to Megamind (based on his actions of, you know, taking over the city).I think Megamind was well and truly trapped by his exterior and his persona as “the villain,” and the only way to escape it was to lie about who he was. If you feel differently, please share your thoughts :)Things that will most likely change my view, though, are going to be evidence against points 1, 2, and 3, though.",""
"6","CMV: I don't see why a chef or cook needs to understand or respect the 'culture' from where a recipe came from.","I think that this is something I once heard Gordon Ramsay say, where a person asked him ""Does a chef need to respect the culture that a food comes from?"" To which Gordon answered 'Yes, absolutly . Chef's have a responsibility to do so.'I don't see why this is the case. Food is food. Just because a culture far away from you came up with a certain kind of food doesn't mean that I owe it to that culture or those people to understand anything, or even respect anything about them.Much of our modern mathematics is based on thinkers from the Golden Age of Islam, who's work was taken from the greeks, and then would go on to influence later mathematicians. But I sure as heck do not need, nor would anyone say that I am obligated to learn Islamic or Arabic history, learn anything about the Islamic religion, learn any arabic, or even know the names of the specific mathematics who's techniques I'm learning.I mean sure I know the name Pythagoras, but I couldn't tell you anything about him beyond that he was Greek and probably a pagan. And he's the *only* one who's name I even know. There are probably hundreds of other mathematicians who's work informed what I was taught in school, and I don't need to know about any of them.Why should food be any different? Why would I need to give a crap about anything regarding Thai history/culture to realize that orange, spice, and cashews are a fantastic combo? Why would I need to learn anything about Italy to appreciate a good pasta and red wine?I'm not saying it's *bad* to know these things of course. A richer understanding of history and the world around you is a good thing in and of itself. But it's not any kind of *obligation*. So I don't see a problem with a chef cooking 'authentic' cuisines and having zero interest in learning about that part of the world.",""
"7","CMV: The movie ""The One"" has the best ending for a hero and villain in any entertainment media","\*\*\*Spoilers for the movie ""The One"" for anyone concerned about that\*\*\*I definitely haven't consumed all books, TV shows, and movies out there, but at least of all those that I have seen and read, The One has the best ending for its hero and villain.For anyone who hasn't seen The One, the hero and villain are both played by Jet Li.  The villain seeks to kill the last version of himself in the multiverse in order to become all powerful.  The hero starts out not even knowing the multiverse exists, but ends up needing to survive against his other-self.  Both characters are incredibly powerful already because the strength of all their alternate selves the villain killed have been poured into them.In the midst of the fighting between the two, the hero loses his wife.Normally in a movie like this, there is a winner and a loser, and in some ways there is here too, but with a twist.  The hero gets sent to a new universe where he appears in a very idealized version of Los Angeles which has clean streets, nice people, and most importantly for the hero, a different version of his wife which he meets at the end, presumably to live happily ever after with.  The villain is sent to a penal colony in a very gloomy and dark world.  At the center of the area is a temple which seems to be the place the strongest criminals occupy the top of.  As the movie comes to a close it shows the unnaturally strong villain character making his claim to the top of the temple as he fights the other inmates while the track ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach plays.I've never walked away from a show or book thinking that if it continued on that we'd see both the hero and villain living their best lives, but I felt that way as this movie faded to black.  I believe that this is the best ending for a hero and villain duo in any entertainment media, but I'm interested in seeing if anyone can change my view :)",""
"8","CMV: The best voting system is ranked choice with a condorcet selection and runoff","This topic comes up a lot in this sub, but I can't find any specifically suggesting this idea so please give it a shot.First I want to immediately address a big misconception. **Ranked choice voting and instant runoff are not the same thing**. Ranked choice is any system where the voter ranks the candidates on the ballot in order of preference. At this point, there are multiple ways of determining who is the winner based on the ranked ballots. Instant runoff is just one method. There are many others. Usually when this topic comes up, people are suggesting a ranked choice ballot and an instant runoff (I'll refer to this as RC+IRV) method for counting the ballots. That is not exactly what I am suggesting.The main problem with RC+IRV is that it can fail to select the condorcet winner. The condorcet winner is the one who who win a heads up contest between any of the other candidates. Not all contests will produce a condorcet winner (think rock-paper-scissors; no clear winner) but if there is a condorcet winner, they should be the overall winner.Approval voting and STAR voting are often suggested as alternatives to RC+IRV. I don't think these are good alternatives. My view is that there are 3 critically important criteria we should look for in a voting system:1. It should select the condorcet winner (if one exists)2. It should make the voter feel that their ballot accurately reflects their opinions3. The selection of the winner should be simple and straightforward, so that the election feels fairRanked choice ballots exemplify the second criterion. Ranking candidates sends a clear signal. RC+IRV however fails the first criterion.Approval voting fails the second. Say the voter is faced with a candidate they like, a few candidates that they'd tolerate, and a candidate they hate. They must decide whether to vote for only the candidate they like (in which case, you are no better off than with FPTP), or vote for all but the candidate you hate (in which case you essentially get a bunch of negative ballots). This completely fails to capture information about who voters actually want.STAR is an interesting one, but I think it fails the third criteria. Say a voter somewhat likes a candidate. Do they score them a 3 or a 4? What are the implications of that choice? It is too complicated.I suppose a new method. If this exact idea has been proposed/debated before, please send me links.Voters cast ranked choice ballots. The ballots are tallied, and if a condorcet winner exists, they win! If no condorcet winner exists, (much like in a traditional IRV) the candidate with the fewest first place votes is removed and their votes transferred to the second choice of the ballots. Then repeat the process. If there is a condorcet winner amongst the remaining candidates, they win! And so on.This addresses the condorcet problem of traditional RC+IRV, while retaining the expressiveness of ranked ballots. It also does not require cryptic equations/processes to determine the winner. What do you think?",""
"9","CMV: the essentialist view on identity is correct, the anti essentialist is wrong"," [**SmilingGengar**](https://www.reddit.com/user/SmilingGengar/)**:** >I think the general confusion stems from a gradual paradigm shift around the concept of identity that is in progress. Specifically, the public is moving away from an essentialist view in which the reality of something can be discerned by observing its characteristics (substantial form) to an anti-essentialist view that sees identity as self-driven and influenced by social and political power.I believe an essentialist view is correct because it allows me to make up my own mind based on observation, whereas an anti-essentialist view is wrong because divorcing observation from identity denies me the ability to decide what behavior the other person deserves. I believe that making up my own mind about other people and adopting a behavior based on that is sacred and because of that any demand that is in opposition to this, is abhorrent. therefore, the anti-essentialist idea of identity is repugnant.",""
"10","CMV: ""Protest"" and ""Punitive"" voting is harmful","Since I don't reside in my country of birth and thus don't follow the local politics as much, for the past several elections i have resorted to an online tool that simply asks me a bunch of policy questions and tells me which of the parties' programs matches it best and picked what it tells me to. When I told this to my parents they were mortified. They think that it would be better to not vote at all and that it's borderline anti democratic. When I asked why they said it didn't take into account if they actually MET those promises or not. What you are ""supposed"" to do is to vote for different parties or not vote if they don't give you what you want as ""punishment"". This got me on a rant because ""protest"" votes are what led to Brexit and a bunch of populists taking over. This sort of spiteful action is against the democratic process.Personally, I don't care about the human I am voting for. I wouldn't even want to know their name in a perfect world. Only policy matters, and unless you are facing a literal life or death situation like the second coming of fascism, then I don't see any reason to vote on anything that's not policy related. If the government actually does what I want, then it's not my problem and I can't do anything about it. Isn't essentially ""meta gaming"" democracy by punishing the actual actors counterproductive?",""
"11","CMV: Netflix’s Fastest Car should move their races from unprepped airport runways to “prepped” drag strips","For those who don’t know, the basic premise of the show is that sleeper cars, or cars that don’t look fast but actually are fast drag race against much more expensive super cars that are some of the fastest cars you can buy from the showroom floor.The sleeper cars are often built from scratch so to speak from very cheap cars.There have been two times where there have been significant car wrecks during the races because powerful cars lost traction and spun out. One of the wrecks, an electric Datsun lost traction, spun out and crashed into a Mazda RX2, both rare cars. The other wreck a Foxbody Mustang spun out and nearly clipped several other cars before coming to a stop at the edge of the airport strip they were racing on.If the drag races took place on a quarter mile drag strip that allowed some minor prep work to the track, the conditions would be safer and the chance of cars spinning out and wrecking could be reduced.",""
"12","CMV: The Sonic Adventure games, while admittedly fun, are vastly overrated.","I semi-recently replayed the sonic adventure games. I played the first on a whim by myself, and played most of the second in a Discord call with my friends. I had fun, we all had fun, and that was mostly it. I say semi-recently because this was about a year ago, but the SA games recently came up in a discussion I was having.I'm not really a Sonic die-hard; I owned the first game when I was younger, handed down from one relative or another, and it was fun if a tad frustrating (I didn't really mesh with the speed and it led to it feeling like trial and error). It's important to know that, because I really, genuinely had no idea the Sonic Adventure games were held up so highly within the fanbase.And in all honesty.. I simply do not get it. Are they fun? Sure, I'll give you that. But, if I'm being entirely honest, I can't rate them much higher than 'okay'. They aren't particularly challenging, they're graphically competent, and they have good music - the gameplay forms are, well a mixed bag.The Sonic segments are probably the highlight, but even then they never really escape from what I feel has always been a Sonic problem - in my limited experience - of being wonky to control outside of the scripted 'go fast' sections.My enjoyment hits a snag there, though, because I don't think the Tails/Eggman or Rouge/Knuckles segments would have been all that enjoyable if I didn't have the ability to quickly look up a guide. Controlling Rouge or Knuckles is an exercise in frustration through fairly uninteresting locals.The Tails and Eggman sequences are easily my least favourite parts of the games. To be blunt, I think anyone praising them has serious nostalgia blindness. They're pathetically easy, too long for how uninteresting they are, and I'm pretty sure they gave me tinnitus or something.I won't mention the story much here, as it was not really of interest to me, nor were the characters all that much; it wasn't really what I decided to pick them up for at the time. That said, I found most of the characters fairly annoying and by the time I was done, they were getting on my nerves, Sonic especially. I'll totally jam to the music from these games any day, but I don't really see what makes people hold these games up as classic examples of the Sonic games franchise, and I feel like I'm missing something others didn't.",""
"13","CMV: #1 No one gender is more toxic than the other. It should be people with power many times abuse power. #2 Most toxic extremist views exist on the internet than IRL.","Disclaimer : Using men and women as the genders for conversation because I have had more opportunities interacting with these two genders. No hate please.\[#1\] I grew in a very patriarchal society/country but my dad and everyone in my family have more trust in me and encourage me than any other male child. Honestly, I did not experience this. I only saw my friends experiencing it. At the same time, my mom never complained about dad's salary which was common in some of my friends family. The toxicity I have experienced is mostly outsidea. Difficult men : I work in IT where majority of the power positions are held by men. So most toxicity I have experienced are from men, met men shaming women who wants to have a career, men who think adult women who are groomed should not be protected by law.b. Difficult Women : Women who wants to spend all the money on expensive stuffs while they don't contribute much to the family, women who spread hatred against other women, women who always criticize their partner, women who think all men out there are waiting to get them.\[#2\] When I analyze these people, most are not one dimensional. Some have unchecked bias about one specific thing because it has not been challenged or some other views that is stopping them to see reality. Very rarely they are 360 degree toxic.When I come to internet, I see comments that are so one dimensional and it is in larger number. One hating the other gender. And sometimes when I check their accounts, they have dedicated months and sometimes years commenting extremist views. But these are really smaller percentages. say 10/100 people. People who are very close to me over time have changed their views when challenged with some data and time.So here I am, change my view.FYI : I am in PST timezone. I am awake for another 30 minutes.

"14","CMV: filming / streaming in gyms should be banned","All different kinds of people use gyms, right?  There are professional body builders, there are people who genuinely enjoy workouts but aren't there to try to bulk up / slim down, and of course, there are people who really don't want to be there but know that they need to do something to get healthier.  The last group, among whose ranks I used to count myself, are often extremely self conscious about just about every aspect of being there.  Not lifting heavy enough weights.  Not running fast enough on the treadmill.  Not looking as good in my crappy sweatpants and stained baggy t-shirt compared to people wearing over $100 worth of athleticwear.  And then you have people who think that the gym is their personal fitness TV studio.  If you're a streamer who doesn't care about other people in your shot, then great - now my self-conscious ass is going on the internet for all to see.  If you're a streamer who does care - way too much - about other people being in your shot, then you may end up going off on someone for simply trying to use the gym and getting in your way when all they're doing is trying to access the gym that they paid a membership for.My view is simple: gyms need to stop allowing this.  Obviously outbursts aren't allowed and actively problematic people will usually be dealt with accordingly, but why even let it get there in the first place?  Why allow recording in a room full of self-conscious, sloppily dressed people?  And let's look at it from one more angle: what about the women who show up in workout gear that is barely more than a swimsuit, because they know they get really hot during cardio and are just trying to stay cool enough to not completely hate their workout?  Maybe they don't want to be shown like that in the back of some guy's gym videos either and become the target of some creep's online harassment. Ban filming in gyms.  CMV.",""
"15","CMV: The theory of evolution/natural selection as a means of explaining things is self-fulfilling","I know I only have a layman's understanding of ""natural selection"" from pop culture, so this might just be my clever way to get smarter people to explain science to me :)Anyway, something that has always really *really* bothered me is almost every trait or biological discovery being explained in terms of how it helps a species propagate. e.g. ""We suspect this geese-giraffe has purple pigment on its legs because it's one of the 5 colours other geese-giraffe can see and it must help with mating"" like *what?* Everything in this explanation seems to start with the premise that *the theory of evolution/natural selection definitely correct and we move backwards from it.* But isn't the entire *point* of science that we don't actually ""know"" and can't assume anything? What if the theory of natural selection is a local maximum and it's ""kind of"" a good approximation (good enough, like Newtonian physics) but if we just start all explanations from assuming it's true, isn't it just kind of... self-fulfilling?It just seems to me that you can always come up with some kind of bullshit reason why something is ""contributing"" to the species being able to propagate. The geese-giraffe's legs might be purple because eating more purple grapes makes it run faster. Or maybe potential mates like bright colours. Or maybe *it's just a random thing that happened, and it has absolutely 0 bearing on anythign at all* but apparently that can't be an answer. Like, you see homosexuality all over the animal kingdom. Natural selection clearly can't explain *that*??? What if some folks just wanna engage with their own kind cause they were *born that way* 🎤 And yet we completely ignore these cases and just explain everything else based on propagation.The absolute worst of this is when I see ""natural selection"" getting applied outside of narrow realms of biological research, and we almost start justifying the current state of the world as the de-facto ""best fit"". I *think* this is called Social Darwinism? Anyway, I see this thinking used all the time to justify all sorts of terrible things but maybe this is an irrelevant aside. The point is, it uses the same self-fulfilling self-justifying logic because it's very hard to argue with ""Well this is the current state of the world, and we already take for granted that things only last if they're the ""best fit"", therefore everything dominant in the current state of our world is de-facto best fit.""Hopefully what I'm saying makes sense.",""

This creates a split in our nation** that other powers, like China, can easily exploit to weaken us.That's why I hate the whole idea of ""identities"".

By identifying yourself as something else you are essentially splitting the population into various factions.**If you try to preach about integrating immigrants into being an America and assimilating, they'll call you a racist and ""white-washing"" people**, which is absolutely ridiculous.

"17","CMV: The bodily autonomy argument for abortion doesn't work","Disclaimer: i support abortion rights up until 18 weeks (and later in exceptional circumstances) because i don't believe a fetus has moral value prior to that as i value sentience. However, the bodily autonomy argument has never sat right with me.People using this argument often say ""it doesn't matter if it is a person or not, it has no right to use her body without her consent"" and the necessary logical conclusion of this argument is that she should have free choice to abort it for any reason up until 9 months, which i think is abhorrent. Pregnancy is often compared to being connected to a violinist to keep him alive, but the fundamental difference which makes all the difference in my eyes is personal responsibility. In the violinist analogy, its only really comparable to rape, whereas most of the time, the baby is in her womb due to actions which she took.The three criteria which i think give the baby rights to use the woman's body for survival is 1. The baby being in her womb was caused by her actions, 2. The baby was forced into a state of dependence on her (violating the babies rights), and 3. she knew the risk of the baby being forced into a state of dependence on her when the act took place.The three criteria must be met to give the baby this right. For example, it the baby was forced into her due to rape, it would satisfy criteria 2 and 3 but not 1, therefore bodily autonomy would still hold in my view. If someone drives recklessly and injures someone, i don't think that the driver should be forced to use their body for donating organs or blood to the person they hit, as the person who was hit can be helped by medics so the driver didn't force them into a state of dependence on them. Even if the driver was the only one whose organs could save him, the driver would have had to have known that that was the case in order to fulfil all three criteria, which in the real world doesn't happen.The baby is not violating her rights, it is the other way around. The baby did not choose to be in her body, it didn't choose to be dependent on her, it is in there due to actions she took, therefore she violated their rights. If i knowingly cast a spell on someone, where that person is put in a weakened state and is then magically attached to my body for survival, whose violated whose bodily autonomy? I  think a much stronger case could be made that i violated their bodily autonomy not the other way around. Even if there was just a chance that that would happen when i cast the spell, i still think i violated their rights, i don't see why they should be punished for actions i took.""Forcing a woman to carry a baby is slavery"". Not to sound callous, but parents are already slaves to their children, especially their babies. They have to feed them, wash them, provide them with shelter, take them to the toilet etc. You wouldn't be obligated to do this for any other child so why your own? I think its for the same reasons i listed above. By bringing children into existence you are knowingly making them dependent on you, therefore you are obligated to care for them. If a woman doesn't have to use her body to keep her baby alive, why cant parents just abandon their children since the baby doesn't have special rights? I know that intuitively, using someones body seems different to using someones house, but i don't really see a morally important difference between having the right to someones body and the right to someones food, shelter, time, energy, money etc. If a woman can abort a baby, i would have to hear a reason why she can't just abandon her child on the side of the road.The analogy i will use is this (it's pretty ridiculous but as long as its analogous i don't care). Let's say that there's a cursed video game where every time you play it there is a chance that someone will be shrunk, put in a weakened state, and attached to your body to survive for 9 months. If i play the game, knowing the risk, and that happens, should i have the right to kill them to get them off of my body?Furthermore, for later stages of abortion, i would argue that since the woman had lots of time to get the abortion already and chose not to, she is even more culpable and therefore less justified in aborting it (unless of course it is for medical reasons).So i do still support abortion, but i argue from the point of when the fetus gains moral value (which i think is about 18 weeks as that is the earliest time at which it is sentient as far as i know) rather than arguing from bodily autonomy. Would be interested to hear critiques of my arguments above and if there is anything about bodily autonomy i'm missing.",""

Hanging out with friends, family, significant other, etc. Enjoying hobbies. Working out. Cooking, cleaning, doing chores. Any time you spend researching politics or catching up on the news is time you could spend doing something better. Even just relaxing and messing around on your phone is better. Even if you are going to research stuff or try to acquire knowledge, just about any subject is better than politics or the news. For starters, consuming too much information in the politics/news realm makes you more annoying. Politics is probably the worst conversation topic to have in the real world because it usually leads to counterproductive arguments, disagreements, etc. No matter what angle you are coming from, you are going to annoy some other people who disagree with you. It also makes you less interesting. People who are super into politics and the news are usually somewhat of bots / NPCs who have too many generic talking points in their head. Additionally, there is zero real benefit to it. If there is a news story that is actually important, you will end up hearing about it without having to go out of your way. It will come to you. You don't need to follow the news. When it comes to voting, you only have a limited number of choices, and it's pretty obvious who to pick based on your values and preferences. You don't need to do all this research for an easy decision. Not only that, but someone who is super well researched in politics ultimately has the same amount of voting power as someone who doesn't really care that much. You could be the ultimate debate lord, and you still only have as much power as the next random person who spends zero time researching it. Lastly, politics and the news are toxic in general. When it comes to politics, it ends up devolving into tribalism, and the more invested you are in it, the more likely you are to become tribalistic. Meanwhile, the news you hear about is mostly just bad things happening in the world, which you really don't need to know about.",""
"20","CMV: Genuine, reciprocal friendships are a myth, and most people are only looking for the minimum investment required for support","I've come to believe that there is no such thing as genuine friends who are truly invested in a mutual and reciprocal relationship. Instead, I think most people who claim to be friends are only looking to maintain the absolute minimum level of investment in the relationship in order to have someone available for emotional or logistical support when needed. The less effort they need to put in, the more blatantly unbalanced the relationship becomes.I'll admit that I don't have many friends, but I believe this is due to two specific observations I've made:1. I have ""friends"" who will go silent for more than six months, not sending a single message or birthday wish, only to suddenly reach out when they need help with a job, moving, childcare, etc. This has happened on numerous occasions, leading me to question the sincerity of these relationships.2. When I attempt to engage with these friends after seeing a post on Facebook or a story on another social media platform, their responses are often basic and dismissive, like ""Yeah, I know, it's great!"" They never acknowledge the time that has passed, suggest meeting up, or show any interest in my life. This pattern has repeated itself consistently, making it difficult for me to believe in the idea of genuine friendships.I know I might sound bitter, but this has been my experience with about 95% of the people I've encountered, and it seems blatantly obvious to me that this is just how most people behave. I understand that there are exceptions to this rule and that some people may indeed have genuine friendships, but I have yet to experience this for myself.Despite my negative experiences, I am open to having my view challenged. If you can provide counterexamples, personal stories, or any other evidence that supports the existence of genuine, reciprocal friendships, I would be more than happy to reconsider my perspective. So, can you change my view?",""

"22","CMV: Star Wars' Andor is about 9/11","Andor's heist on Aldhani is an attack  by a small insurgent group, some of whom used to work for the empire,  on a target of symbolic value. The aim of the attack is to provoke the empire into an overreaction they cannot sustain, which would lead to an increase in resistance, cause the empire to over-extend itself, and ultimately bring about its collapse. This is pretty much exactly what Bin Laden wanted to achieve with 9/11. Additionally, both attacks were made possible by imperial complacency and repeating them immediately became impossible as the empire and the US cracked down with  additional security measures.The analogy would not be entirely unprecedented either, since the original Star Wars was directly inspired by the Vietnam war (with the US being the empire and the rebels the Viet Cong).There  are differences in that Aldhani did not have a significant civilian death toll, and in the ideologies of the rebel groups and their origins, but the fundamental aims and effects of both events are too similar to be coincidental.",""
"23","CMV: Sex is broader than Gender in USA right now as Gender is what you are assigned at birth","Here is the logic1) Sex refers to the biological attributes of a person.  While typically XY and XX, you can have stuff like Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY), SRY transposition, androgen insensitivity, and other items that create - biologically - a variety of possibilities as to what one’s sex is beyond male/female.2) Gender is a social - not an individual - construct and is how society (not the individual) classifies a person in relation to sexual differences between people.  Gender definitions can vary from society to society and time period to time period.Where people get mixed up is believing that their individual gender identification has a bearing on how society constructs their gender.  It is asserted frequently that it does (see various definitions online that assert gender identity has a bearing on gender), but there is scant evidence that society agrees.  Recent polling, from Pew back in 2022 shows that an overwhelming and increasing majority of Americans (60 vs 38 percent) say that whether a person is a man or a woman is determined by what is assigned at birth as opposed to something that can be changed later.https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/So what is the implication?  If society does not believe one can change being a man or a woman from what you are assigned at birth that means the society views gender as immutable and also as independent of one’s gender identity.  Moreover, it is some indication that society views gender as binary or at most binary with a neuter option.  And if sex is more complicated than three options and gender is at most three options with it likely being just binary then you end up with the following:Unless society recognizes a neuter option: gender is what you are assigned at birth and is narrower than your sex.To change my view on this I would need to see evidence through polling that a society in question currently regards gender as determined at least in part by self-identification.  Legal fictions and dictionary definitions that were created without examining the social construct do not count in my eyes.",""
"24","CMV: Kindness has never actually built anything and a society could theoretically perfectly function without it and all these uplifting news or love stories are actually full of shit","I will say my biases before going in, as I think it'll make it clearer to understand where I'm coming from. I am from eastern Ukraine (the type of Donbas that was occupied in 2014), and also I have a an uncommon brain type and used to have a lot of physical health problems as a child which made raising me exhausting resourcewise and difficult. I think these are things affecting my judgement.So, the collision I'm experiencing is that now I live in one of the most developed and peaceful countries on the planet. And my therapists are doing something that's very confusing with my ""civilian reentry"", for the lack of a better word, they're teaching me all these soft unicorn fluffy values of ""kindness"", ""compassion"", ""empathy"". Like I'm not an asshole or a lowlife, i just... feel something about these words that is the reason why i'm posting here.So my opinion is that kindness, compassion, etc. actually the reason why societies fall instead of thriving. Consider basic values like freedom of speech, democracy, pretty much everything you cherish. And they exist because humans are evil by nature. Term limits, freedom of speech laws and amendments, power checks and balances exist exactly because humans are by nature tyrannical and evil, and checks need to exist because of that. And on the contrary, tyranny rises because people are politically inept and don't do anything, or equally bad, enjoy the new government because it favors them. And prety much positive news story these days is ""homeless guy works 4294967296 hours a millisecond to help his cancer girlfriend who is drowning in student loan debt"".I think kindness, compassion, and empathy actually bear a little resemblance to communism. Every time people try to build a society off of them, it falls apart because that's simply not realistic, and then advocates for kindness mop it up by saying ""That wasn't *real* kindness!""... Besides, was it kindness that freed minorities from oppression? No. Only armed resistance.",""
"25","CMV: it is rude to expect others to wait to eat their hot food if you haven’t been served yet.","This only applies to hot meals, if it’s a salad or other cold item I think waiting is appropriate. But if person A orders something hot, and person B doesn’t have their order yet, it is rude to expect person A to wait while their food is getting cold. Then person B is eating fresh, hot food, while person A’s meal is not as good as it would have been. I think waiting a minute or so is fine, but if it’s apparent the meal was forgotten or going to take a long time, this applies. Even though I have been in this position as person A, I still wait because it feels taboo, but I think it’s a stupid cultural expectation. If I am the one waiting to eat I always insist everyone around me eats and I think that should be the norm. I am not so important that everyone around me should have subpar food. It’s not like I’m on the brink of starvation, I truly don’t get why this has become expected.ETA: this is coming from an experience where someone did not and would not allow others to eat even though there was a mistake and we knew their food would take a while. Someone else asked if they minded if we started and they said that it was rude to start. It seems the general consensus is that this is rude, but not common.

"26","CMV: You can be severely depressed and/or anxious without having a blatantly obvious reason, and it’s not because of character or moral defects","So I just want to start off by saying that I’ve have been diagnosed with severe clinical depression on multiple occasions, and have mild anxiety. I’ve had some small hard things, but for the most part, I’ve had a pretty affluent and smooth life.I know that I feel miserable, and that I by definition meet the standards for severe clinical depression (x amount of symptoms for most days for 2 weeks that impairs daily functioning). Even with meeting the criteria for depression, I can function somewhat well (I have friends and a job).I’ve gotten implicit and explicit messages from family, friends, coworkers, and society that mental illness isn’t real. And if they are, that only severely traumatized people get depressed or severe mental illnesses, or that there has to be this big reason for someone to have depression. And if anyone claims otherwise, they’re just lazy/selfish/wimpy. While I think that big life events is a big factor for mental illnesses, the idea of trauma is relative. What’s traumatic for me may not be traumatic for you. So it’s unfair to say that only people who go through “big” traumas can have mental illnesses.Also, genetics have some impact here. I don’t want to get in the whole nature vs nurture debate, but I feel like it’s fair to say there’s at least some genetic or physiological component to depression.And lastly, I’ve worked my butt off. I go to therapy multiple times a week, take psychiatric medications, work out daily, have a job, see friends, do daily self help stuff, have hobbies, and eat relatively well- yet I still feel deeply depressed sometimes.Tl:dr- I want/choose to believe that mental illness is real and doesn’t have to have an obvious cause. This doesn’t make the individual lazy, stupid, or whatever. And depression isn’t just a matter of sucking it up and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Having a mental illness doesn’t have to be justified by some major tragic event, nor does it mean you “failed” at life.Edit 1Ok thanks for all of those who’ve replied. I appreciate the feedback and support. I know many of you find this question unhelpful at best and harmful at worst, and that wasn’t my intention when posting.

A) Trump was still the president, there was a legal doctrine declaring him as such.  He was going to come back into power with a military coup.    B) Same as A, but his VP of his new world was going to be a resurrected JFK Jr.???  C) A few more believable theories that simply state that the democrats are trying to eradicate American culture and Trump, and consequently a fascist regime by the political right, was the only answer.

I am not an apologist for Japan's actions in any way. The Japanese fascist imperialist state acted in aggression upon other countries.  However, I believe Japan has sufficiently apologized for its actions. Also, I won't downvote anyone in this thread.  I'll be able to spend about 2 hours in this thread and I'll read replies after, too.**My position:**Immediately following its defeat, Japanese war criminals were tried, with many of Japan's government executed. Japan paid reparations to the countries it assaulted\* which often totaled several years worth of those countries' GDP in addition to giving land back - though even this amount is low to me, it was an amount decided on by Japan and its peer nations at this time. Since then, Japanese politicians at the highest levels of government have apologized readily, often, and willingly - until recently. As of now, a modern Japanese person is well removed from the imperial era. Modern Japan is a peaceful place and modern citizens shouldn't be made to feel like they haven't done enough to atone for the sins of their fathers.\*This asterisk is for China, which I will get to later.**Arguments against my position that have not yet convinced me, but maybe could if people put some additional context/effort into them.**1. **Some nations have not accepted Japan's apologies, and therefore, the apologies are not good enough.** Not accepting Japan's apologies allows Japan's neighbors to seek additional grievances and make claims against Japan's government that allow politicians to whip up fervor amongst their base. I believe there are incentives for many nations to not accept or downplay Japan's apologies, especially in places where populations believe Japan is beyond forgiveness.2. **\*Japan hasn't done enough to acknowledge crimes against China and Nanking.** This is a particularly difficult thing for Japan to do because the Chinese government's official estimates of losses and crimes committed against their citizens is inflated. For example, the consensus estimate for the death toll at Nanking is 200,000 people. China's estimate is 100,000 (33%) higher.3. **The recent Japanese governments, especially under Shinzo Abe refused to apologize, and this indicates Japan as a nation is not sorry.** How I read the situation is that Abe is done with the apologies. Abe's predecessors apologized openly and often, even after Abe was the prime minister. I think if I was in Abe's shoes, I wouldn't apologize either, because the apologies are never good enough. That said, Abe's *denial* of some aspects of the war, eg. comfort women, is unforgivable. Abe is now dead so we will never hear him apologize.4. **There are factions within the Japanese government and society that downplay the war and other atrocities.** I agree this is a problem, but there are science-denying, history-denying, ultra-nationalist evidence-denying people in every country.Please help me change my view or add more context to my view.",""

It seems entirely reasonable to assume that mammals raised for food’s internal lives and inter-species relationships are just as vivid as my dog’s.

I get that it’s easier to say, but to British and Irish ears, the former is a direct statement taken at face value.**Edit 2**: A *lot* of responses here boils down to the idea that, somehow, American English language conventions are more correct and more important than actual English language conventions.

This relates to metabolism etc. although I don't really understand the biological aspect of it.I don't think many here would doubt that theres some level of bounce back effect with weight and metabolism, but the question is can that be overcome?Anecdotally this has been my observation. I've never met someone who was obese and developed into athletic or skinny shape for the long haul.

"33","CMV: Whilst learning about lived experience is important, deferring to people for answers on what one should or shouldn't do, purely because of their unchosen characteristics, is illogical and ironically bigoted."," Hi All, I appreciate getting feedback from people who are involved in an issue, but there's a worryingly ever growing trend of deferring to people purely because of their unchosen characteristics, instead of the quality of their logic, the evidence they provide, and their ethical reasoning, and that's what we should always be basing our decisions off of, not the speaker's characteristics, etc.   (For those who don't know, unchosen characteristics refers to any aspect of a person that they did not choose; e.g., sex, race, sexuality, birthplace etc.).   After all there is no universal consensus on *any* issue on the planet held by such groups, and if someone assumed otherwise, that would be incredibly bigoted.   As there is no universal consensus, there will always be disagreements that require additional criteria to discern the quality of the argument; e.g. ""Two X-group people are saying opposite things. How do I decide who to listen to?"" And the answer is: the quality of their logic, the evidence they provide, and their ethical reasoning. Which of course means, that often the whole exercise is a pointless one in the first place, as we should be prioritising our capacity for understanding logic, evidence and ethics, not listening to X person for the sole reason that they have Y unchosen characteristics.   I think that listening to lived experience is important, re: listening to lived experience (e.g. all X groups experience Y problem that Z group wasn't aware of); but that's not the same as deferring to people on decision making because of their unchosen characteristics.   I try to have civil, productive discussions, but that's getting harder and harder these days.   For those who appreciate civil dialogue, feel free to skip this; for those who don't; I humbly ask that you refrain from personal attack (it's irrelevant to the question), ask clarifying questions instead of assuming, stay on topic, answer questions that are asked of you, and as the above points to:   \-Provide evidence for claims that require it   \-Provide logical reasoning for claims that require it   \-Provide ethical reasoning for claims that require it   I will not engage with uncivil people here.",""

Nonetheless, I think it is crucial to talk with kids about it.The school is a place that should give life skills, in addition to profession skills like mathematics and English. If it wasn't saw, you might as well argue to also cancel the humanities in school (though a small portion of society can earn a living from it - academia, writers, etc.). Hence I believe that a crucial aspect of human life like sex should be talked more about, even if it's very embarrassing. Of course, rules should be enforced so discussions don't slide to problematic areas. As a teenager, I had a class on sexual education. It went like : 1. use condoms. 2. sexual diseases. 3. sexual harassment, consent and rape.As many before me said, it's important to speak of the importance of pleasure for both; the importance of feeling good with your body; toxic relationships (for men and women, in hetero-relationships or gay, etc.); the anxiety it might provoke and how to live a good sex life.",""

(License revoked)I think this should apply to all who had an impact. That would be CEO, CFO, and any risk management people and possibly board members. We need to curb risky behavior and permanently being removed from thier career should be an option. Often times criminal behavior isn't provable, but negligence when dealing with other people money should exclude you from being able to do it again. When we look at SVB, we see certain people grabbing their money and running, those seem to have advanced knowledge of a collapse, and there should be punishment to anyone who had insider information and acted as well. I support making depositors whole, but people caused this issue and there has to be real long term consequences for them. To change my view, why wouldn't licensing solve this? Or maybe a better solution to hold the decision makers accountable.",""

I don't think they want me defending this position, so I will stop aggravating them by ending my replies. Thanks for all the great feedback!!!  :)&#x200B;For many people who cannot afford to have children--or simply don't want to have children--it has become too risky to have sex in states where abortion and day after pills have been banned. Some may take the risk, of course, but for many others, such as myself, I can't imagine having sex when it could totally ruin my life (as well as the life of potential partners and future children).Although I am middle class and middle aged, there is no way that I can afford children---and I've never wanted children. So I simply can't imagine sex being a viable option in my life.It could be said that contraception is still available, but it's not 100%. Why take the risk when having children would mean raising them in a world where their parents can't afford to feed them and don't even want them?Another objection might be that technically there is no ban. True! But that's why I said ""effectively banned."" The phrasing is intended to convey the point that the negative consequences have been raised so high---either go to jail or ruin your life with children you can't afford--it's simply unrealistic in actual practice for many of us to have sex as a viable option in life.CMV!!  :)&#x200B;EDIT: Condoms are only 98% effective. Someone in their 20s or 30s having sex a couple hundred times a year really is taking a risk with life consequences.  Also, partners can forget to take their birth control or lie about it to you, which is another risk. And many poor people cannot afford or have insurance for a vasectomy.EDIT 2 on Deltas: I've awarded 2 deltas so far on insurance covering vasectomies and day after bills still being legal. Great job!

"41","cmv: ""anti-woke"" just means selectively preventing freedom of choice and diversity.","The governor of my state is proposing to abolish many diversity related courses and safe spaces for students in public universities, such as the one I'm attending. This includes courses about Jewish or African Americans, gender studies, and centers for African American, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Latino, or LGBTQ+ students. The language in the bill also suggests that black sororities and fraternities would be banned from campuses. None of the things that the governor's bill is targeting are mandatory for university students to take part in or complete for graduation. They are simply options for students who are interested in them, which happens to be a lot of underrepresented students, myself included.His goal is to target and diminish ""woke-ness"", especially in education.I attend a predominantly white university and in recent months, centers for black students have been vandalized with racist graffiti messages MULTIPLE TIMES and anti-semitic messages have been publicly displayed by conservative student clubs. There is a lot of animosity between conservative student orgs. and religious/cultural orgs. like the Hillel Org. at my school. As someone who is ethnically black and Jewish, I already feel unsafe at my university but the possibility of the bill mentioned above being passed (which is highly likely) just makes me feel like transferring to a university in a less red state even though I have a full tuition and housing ride at this school.I'm sharing very specific examples here but the point is, I find self-declared anti-woke people like my governor to be disgustingly unpatriotic. It's one thing to not hold the same beliefs as somebody else but stripping away peoples' rights to safely explore their own beliefs/interests/identities with other like-minded individuals infringes on freedom of speech and expression. I'm saying this as someone who is not even super liberal or woke myself. I don't agree with everything that's deemed woke but I do believe it's dangerous to bar people's freedoms when they pose no physical threat to society.I am open to different views and possibly having my mind changed on this topic. I am not interested in ""what-about-ism"" on woke people, just a direct discussion on anti-woke people and whether or not their intentions are hypocritical.edit: 12 hr mark. i'll wait a few more hours to see if someone presents a view that changes my mind significantly. otherwise post will be deleted if i find it useless. but i have enjoyed hearing your opinions.

Just try to get the concept here, if you can wrap your head around the concepts then fire away!Our society propagates extremist feminist narratives that have yet to be dismantled. How are they still here? Any of these examples ring a bell?:1. A father in a playground with his child? must be  a pedo, call 911!. Thats the default assumption2. A guy out on the street? must be upto no good. Why is he hanging about? is he a criminal? yet we would never expect a woman to be a criminal. We'd think she's waiting for friends or a uber ride.

I am a firm supporter of abortion for reasons I will not go into in this OP as to not derail the comment sections. If you are pro-abortion and want to enact change, violence is one of the worst things you could probably do it.There are many reasons as to why abortions are seen as immoral by some. One very popular one is that either embryos or fetuses have reached a stage in life that the same people interpret as a state **personhood** worth protecting. Most states in the United States consider the murder of a pregnant woman to be ***double*** **homicide,** lining up with the type of state of mind that I'm trying to highlight.Take, for example, **Nazi Germany** when they were genociding jews and other minorities that they deemed undesirable. ~~I can't think of a single person that~~ Most people wouldn't disagree with killing people who were in charge of concentration camps, the guards, the Germans who were executing them.Racial hygiene and the disposal of undesirables wasn't seen as evil. Nazi Germany wasn't a bunch of villains twirling their evil mustaches trying to spread evil for the sake of evil. They were **convinced** that what they've been doing was good.Thus, while I think that anyone who murders an abortion doctor for handling abortions should be punished and convicted for murder, I do morally sympathize with their not-so-far-fetched view that these people were committing murder and deserve to be stopped.",""

I think that with a little ingenuity, Japanese and European cars powered by Japanese and European engines can compete with and even beat American cars at these events.Looking at the results for the Haltech World Cup Finals, there are a lot of super fast import cars that run in the 6 second range like Supras with big turbo 2JZ’s.

"45","CMV: Dr Fatima Cody Standford is misdirecting America","I have recently in the past few months become obsessed with obesity. Looking at the data, it's so hard not to be pessimistic about the future of civilization. As Harvard projects, close to half of the USA's population will be obese by 2030 (1). I'm not going to trying to convince people that they shouldn't be obese, that is a personal choice someone is going to have to make. I'm also not going to tell people that they shouldn't love who they are or be happy with themselves.However, what I do think, is that America has a serious problem and its stubbornness is not helping. Before I start my rant in the title, let me go through a few points that I think are very important. Nutrition education in America is absolutely terrible in the public school system. I could go on and on about how lobbying has destroyed every iteration of the ""food pyramid"" or now it is called ""myplate."" If you wanted to do your own research on that I highly recommend (2). From my personal anecdotal experience, I hope some of you can provide your own; outside of elementary school, we were not taught anything else about nutrition. (I was taught the food pyramid, which said you should have 6-11 servings of carb filled foods everyday). It's no wonder that people don't understand much about nutrition. It's taught to you at an age that you don't even know how to cook or even close to being able to understand your body. What they teach you still doesn't teach you what the different macronutrients do, why you need them, and why is it important at all.I'm not going to say that parents aren't to blame, but they are also just products of a country that prides its freedom and profits over longevity and happiness. Semi-rant over.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_I recently got introduced to Dr. Fatima Cody Standford (a health expert on the Biden administration) from her 60 minutes (3). In this interview she claims that the leading cause of obesity is genetics and that it is a brain disease that causes their body to not be able to lose weight. I was a bit stunned as a knee jerk reaction, as I'm sure most people were. After thinking about it and reading a few other of articles in which she is interviewed, I still disagree.I'm not saying she isn't partially right, however, I think you can't realistically say that obesity is mainly caused by genetics, at least statistically. There are a few things I would like to point out.1. If obesity was majorly caused by genetics, then you would expect that obesity levels would have always stayed around the same, however we are not seeing that as the obesity levels are rising every year at dramatic rates (4).2. If obesity was majorly caused by genetics, you would expect Europe to have similar obesity rates to America, we don't see this at all. I think these statistics are a bit outdated, however, it can be seen that in Europe, generally is about 10% behind America in obesity prevalence. (5). Most American's lineage derives from Europe. If obesity was majorly genetically linked we would expect that Europe would have about the same obesity prevalence as America.In another article Standford claims that ""This is the largest chronic disease worldwide, not just here in the U.S. Yes, everybody assumes it's a U.S. issue. We're actually ranked number 14 out of 200 countries. So we're not award-winning, we're not number 1, but we're behind 13 other countries. So this is a major, global issue."" (6)What Standford fails to mention is that that 12 out of the 13 countries above us are island nations with insanely small populations and the only one that is notable is Kuwait, which has a population a little over 3 million. No where close to the population of the USA. This is such a lousy argument and seems like she is coping with how bad the problem has gotten in America. I'm not saying that obesity isn't a global issue, it most certainly is. However, we are the LEADING first world country of obesity. I think dismissing this and saying ""Oh we aren't number one"" is so ignorantly dismissive and loses credibility towards her arguments at least for me.So where does this leave us? Well, I'm glad you asked. In my opinion, obesity can be attributed to a lot of different aspects of our lives. The list is long. Genetics, Processed foods plague America, loads of sugars are caked into everything, children adopt the diets of their parents, there isn't enough proper education of nutrition, and the number one reason of all; personal choice and the fact that most people simply just don't care about their health. (It can be an entire other post about this, so I'm not going to go into it). At some point for an individual, this spirals out of control and becomes chronic obesity in which there isn't much that can be done to help an individual besides medications or surgery and to the point in which Standford calls a ""brain disease.""I don't think we can sit there and point a finger at one specific aspect of obesity and say ""this is what is wrong!"" It's not different than what we have done in the past, blaming fat or blaming carbs on people becoming unhealthy. None of these macronutrients are harmful by nature, but too much or too little is.\------Now this is when I get a little angry. I'm sure most people have seen the recent craze about Ozempic (generically called semaglutide). As many of you probably already know, this is a drug to treat type 2 diabetes, but has the side effect of losing weight. Dr. Standford is pushing this drug heavily. She consults pharma companies and touts this drug heavily while also being apart of the Biden administration. She claims in this news interview that these medications are making people realize that their weight changes ""are not all their fault."" While I have read up and have seen the benefits of this drug and it does work (albeit with a lot of side effects), it doesn't change the fact that once these people are off the drug, they will just regain the weight the lost.As this article from The Journal of Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism says ""One year after withdrawal of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg and lifestyle intervention, participants regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss, with similar changes in cardiometabolic variables. Findings confirm the chronicity of obesity and suggest ongoing treatment is required to maintain improvements in weight and health."" (7). This article states that Ozempic is only safe to use up to 68 weeks (8).I think Dr. Standford is being a shill for these pharmaceutical companies. Promising a miracle drug that will fix your problems. I agree with her that how we think about obesity is wrong, but I think she's is going down the wrong path by scapegoating genetics instead of trying to help fix a systemic, multi-faceted issue.Anecdotally it seems that most people want simple solutions to complex issues in all aspects of life.Let me know how you all feel about this issue, I would love to hear personal anecdotes and direct criticisms of my logic.Thank you all for reading.&#x200B;edit: (I have sources for the labeled numbers, however I am not allowed to post links as reddit automatically removes them.

"47","CMV: Hitler absolutely committed suicide in his Berlin bunker on 4/30/1945 and conspiracy theories suggesting otherwise have been thoroughly debunked. However, Hitler could've easily escaped Berlin and lived out the rest of his life under a concealed identity if he wanted to.","As far as I am concerned, both of the following statements are equally true:1. ""Hitler committed suicide in his Berlin bunker on April 30th, 1945. The official account of Hitler's death is completely accurate, and all conspiracy theories implying otherwise have been thoroughly debunked.""2. ""Hitler could have ***easily*** escaped Berlin and lived out his days without being caught if he had wanted to.""It seems to me that people who believe Hitler escaped fundamentally misunderstand the man and his worldview. There is no doubt in my mind that Hitler did not wish to escape. His ego was too large for him to live out his remaining days in anonymity like many of his Nazi colleagues did. For 12 years, Hitler possessed absolute power and enjoyed a luxurious life of fame and fortune. Hitler was far from the type of person who could just lie low and live shabbily for the rest of his life. Furthermore, Hitler was a ""Darwinist"" who truly believed that history's ""losers"" deserved to die, and that he, if he lost, deserved to die as well. Additionally, teeth found in the bunker perfectly match Hitler's dental records, and there are several witnesses to Hitler's suicide, among other things. There is no doubt that Hitler committed suicide on April 30th, 1945, and theories suggesting otherwise have been thoroughly debunked.Nevertheless, many claim that even if he wanted to, Hitler could never escape to South America and live out the rest of his life undetected like many of his colleagues did. But is this true? While I initially believed this as well, the more research I've done on this, the more apparent it appears to me that Hitler could have easily fled to South America if he so desired.First of all, during the Soviet invasion of Berlin, Hans Baur ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans\_Baur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Baur)), Hitler's personal pilot, had a plane on standby ready to fly him out of Germany (of course, he declined Baur's offer and chose to commit suicide instead). Hanna Reitsch ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna\_Reitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Reitsch)), another Nazi pilot who could have flown Hitler out of Germany, flew into Berlin on April 26 and returned on April 29, demonstrating that aircraft could fly into and out of Berlin undetected during the Soviet invasion of the city. Hitler had pilots who flew aircraft safely into and out of Berlin during the invasion just waiting for him if he wanted to escape, yet people believe it would've been impossible for him to successfully escape.Throughout Third Reich territory, there were literally massive tunnel networks constructed for the purpose of allowing Nazis to escape in the event of a defeat. Several countries in South America and the Middle East were eager to assist Nazis in escaping justice by utilizing extensive ""ratlines"" networks. There was a great deal of assistance provided by organizations such as Oddessa and many members of the Catholic Church in helping Nazis escape.Furthermore, the so-called ""Nazi Hunting"" of the Allies was an absolute joke. They didn't even try to bring many Nazi War Criminals to justice. In fact, they were all too eager to use their talents instead (Operation Paperclip). Many Nazi War Criminals did not even try to conceal their identities, and several Allied governments received information regarding their whereabouts, but did nothing with it.An example of this is Adolf Eichmann, one of the top men in Nazi Germany. Eichmann didn't even try to conceal his identity. Apart from changing his name to ""Ricardo Klement,"" he did nothing to conceal his identity after fleeing to Argentina. He did not change his appearance whatsoever, all of his family members kept the surname ""Eichmann,"" he literally flew from Argentina to Germany and back several times in the 1950's to meet with old friends and family (and the German authorities did not even give a shit), and his son would even casually brag to others about how his father is the Adolf Eichmann who heroically slaughtered Jews during WW2. And although he made no effort whatsoever to conceal his identity, it took 20 years for him to be brought to justice.Josef Mengele was also one of the most nefarious players in Nazi Germany, did not make efforts to conceal his identity, and was still never found in his lifetime. His fate was only revealed after his death.If these men could evade justice without even trying to conceal their identities, why couldn't Hitler have done the same if he had actually tried to conceal his identity? He literally had body doubles who looked very similar to him. In order to prove that ""Hitler killed himself"", the Nazis could have sent the Soviets the dead body of his body double, while the actual Hitler fled to Argentina. It would be impossible to determine his identity if he had just shaved his mustache off. Have you seen Hitler without a mustache? No one would ever be able to recognize him walking down the street because he looks completely unrecognizable.[https://i.imgur.com/gd9gZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gd9gZ.jpg)[https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--ktr2QVwFEk/WAwXHdZbryI/AAAAAAAALmk/s4qWC2iiogEBhV2MUBPHABM1fPacU9HDQCLcB/s1600/Hitler\_in\_disguise.jpg](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--ktr2QVwFEk/WAwXHdZbryI/AAAAAAAALmk/s4qWC2iiogEBhV2MUBPHABM1fPacU9HDQCLcB/s1600/Hitler_in_disguise.jpg)If you saw Hitler walking down the street in regular clothing without a mustache, I guarantee that you would not recognize him. He looks like a completely generic 1950s British white guy without it ([https://ibb.co/zSyQM6Y](https://ibb.co/zSyQM6Y))!He looks like a completely different person. To be on the safe side, he may have taken more drastic measures to alter his appearance, such as shaving his head bald or dying his hair. There is no doubt that Hitler had the resources and connections necessary to obtain fake identification documents.Ok, it is true that Himmler did try to disguise himself and escape but was caught. Specifically, Himmler shaved his moustache, replaced his glasses and wore an eye-patch. However, Himmer was picked up by the Allies not because they recognized him but because of his forged papers which identified him as belonging to the field police, members who the Allied MP had standing orders to detain. They didn't even know they had him until he gave his real name to the Allied Commander of the holding camp. If Himmler hadn't stupidly disguised himself as a Nazi field police officer, but instead posed as a regular German civilian, he probably would have never been caught.Within fairly recent history - and in this media-saturated modern world - we had a famous war criminal Radovan Karadic hiding right under everybody's noses for more than a decade simply by having grown a big bushy beard. The man was living in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. That is the same country where he was president and committed his crimes. *He was living under the noses of everybody in the very same capital he presided over UNRECOGNIZED for a decade.* The world is a very very big place and even the CIA would have never found Bin laden if he had just decided to live in a village in Turkmenistan for the rest of his life even with all our 24/7 surveillance tech and billions of dollars. He instead lived in a massive house with dozens of people and was still actively and heavily involved with terrorism.Overall, I believe Hitler could've easily escaped without ever being caught if he wanted to. I challenge you to convince me otherwise. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.",""
"48","CMV: The EU should extend membership to North Africa and the Fertile Crescent if they can meet the necessary requirements to join","Basically what the title says. For most of history, “Europe” as a concept has been defined by the Roman Empire. Various states tried to claim themselves to be successors of it, and most states try to trace themselves back to it. The same is true of the states of the Levant, Mesopotamia, and North Africa. Yes, they are mostly Muslim, but besides that they’re far closer culturally to say Italy than they are to Pakistan or Indonesia or even a place like Saudi Arabia. They also have deep trade connections to the EU, and make up half of the Mediterranean’s coastline. Economic migrants from these regions also make up the backbone of many European economies, and it’s in Europe’s best interest to stabilize these countries and help them grow economically. With the exception of Egypt and Turkey, they also all have populations less than existing EU members, so they wouldn’t alter the balance of power that much. On the subject on immigration, the Sahara Desert is also a bunch more defensible border than the Mediterranean Sea, if you care about that. Culturally, many of these states once attempted to emulate European secularism, but failed, somewhat due to Europe closing them off and refusing cooperation or even harming them. I think opening those doors again and making it clear that the EU values these people would make democratic and secularizing reforms much more popular in the long run. I’m not saying that these countries should join tomorrow, far from it, just that they should be given that goal. States like Tunisia, Lebanon, and Israel would be a good place to start if expansion was considered (although again not at the current moment given their instability). I also think that encouraging cultural exchange through programs like EuroVision, NATO, and European sports leagues would be a good first step at improving relations. I think Europe as a cultural zone should end with the Zagros mountains, urals, Caspian Sea, Arabian desert, and Sahara desert, and I think as we move into a more globalized world, that will become clearer and clearer.",""

"50","CMV: Vinyl is an objectively bad audio storage format when compared to digital","Disclaimer: I'm not an audio engineer, scientist or audiophile. I don't own any vinyl records. I'm a relative layman, and my primary interest is computer science, but I'm looking to learn more about audio formats.As you might know, vinyl has been going through a resurgence in the last decade or so. I don't have issues with that, and I'm indifferent to people buying vinyl to collect physical media or for nostalgic reasons. However, I do take issue with some people claiming the vinyl is ""simply better"" than any digital audio formats, saying that there is something irreplaceable with vinyl sound and that it's simply the best format for storing audio. Here is why I disagree:1. **It distorts the recorded sound:** in my mind, an audio format should have only one primary goal - to be able to reproduce a recording that was put onto it as closely as possible. Now, vinyl was a good and cheap solution for its time, but in comparison to modern technology, it seems very outdated. Think of the stereotypical ""vinyl sound"" - the hissing noise with scratchy, cracking sounds. I've never heard a vinyl recording that didn't feature these distortions, and it points to an inability to record clean-sounding audio, which is bad. Add to that the potential distortion from other sources (like a turntable not spinning at precisely the right speed), and it feels like analog formats like these are just.. worse. I'm not saying these are major factors that everyone will care a whole lot about, but reciting the first sentence - if the goal is to reproduce recorded sound as closely as possible, then I don't think anything can rival a digital recording. With a digital format, the only difference between the audio you have and the audio that the music producers had is the equipment that you play it on.2. **It's not really subjective:** a fairly common argument to give credence to vinyl is that people simply experience music differently, hence why the artifacts and noise in a recording might actually be enjoyed by someone. But why should we want that - and more importantly, is this unique to vinyl? Seriously, to offer a comparison - we're pretty decent at grading and comparing, for example, monitor color reproduction. With that industry, there is such a thing as simply being better - a monitor having better brightness, contrast, color accuracy, etc. If no one wants to view everything on a distorted monitor, why would anyone want to listen to distorted music? And.. speaking about these artifacts, couldn't they just be reproduced digitally if needed? Since it's all just sound, I don't see what would stop someone from recording a vinyl to digital, or making a digital filter, and getting the exact same listening experience.3. **It seems extremely fragile:** ideally, a storage format should be fairly durable. Digital is perfect, or almost perfect, with this - if you record digital data, it will always stay identical, no matter how much you access it. This, of course, excludes the possibility of the actual storage medium (like a hard drive) degrading and breaking down, but even then, the digital data can be easily duplicated indefinitely. The 10000th copy will be identical to the first. On the other hand, not only will analog recordings degrade in quality as they are copied, but vinyl just seems extremely fragile. Even in the audiophile circles, there seem to always be discussions on keeping records dust-free, clean, temperature-controlled and so on. But even then, temperature fluctuations and just mere normal use (with the needle scratching the record's surface) will eventually wear it down. How is this not viewed as a major flaw of the format? If I had a record that I knew was going to wear down quickly just by playing it, I'd probably not play it at all to avoid damaging it. When comparing this to infinite replayability of a digital format, this seems like a no-brainer to me.",""
"51","CMV: People who label themselves as 'transgender' are attention-seeking, and/or want to feel like they are a part of a minority group.","Hello all, let me preface this by saying I know I am going to get ripped apart for this post, but I am genuinely open to having my mind changed. I come from the south and didn't meet my first openly LGBT person until I moved out of my tiny hick town at 19. I used to have weird prejudices and repulsions until I opened up to the world a bit more.Anyhow, to get to my reasoning. A few years ago, while working at a warehouse, I met my first trans individual. We were the only two people within 20+ feet of anyone else, constantly working together 5 days a week/8 hrs a day. Due to this, we developed a good friendship, added him on social media, and it was kinda my 'woah-this-is-just-another-person' moment, due to the fact we shared a lot of the same interests. The thing is, they never told me, or as far as I know, anyone else they were trans. They were just a man. And that is what everyone considered him to be, even if some small features still retained from their previous gender. They don't have it on social media, either.Fast forward a few years later, I have a very open-minded (and patient lol) girlfriend and she happens to be best friends with a person who is trans. They're a good person to be around, very funny and laid back. However, they are very loud about the fact that they are trans. she has it on their social media, she brings it up in casual conversation.Now, of course it shouldn't matter how anyone label themselves. However, what has been explained to me through my own research, accounts of trans individuals on socials like Reddit, and my girlfriend is that (correct me if I'm wrong): They felt out of their body as their assigned gender, and having to act in accordance with the gender roles they were assigned to was torturous. So it is either transitioning, or living life like they are lying to themselves. Which I 100% get and empathize with.What I don't get is, if it was so torturous to live life as that gender why would you advertise you used to be it and now aren't? Why not just be firm in your stance ""I am a man."" ""I am a woman.""? It feels like attention-seeking behavior to me, and somewhat akin to me saying ""Hi yes, my name is X and I have a penis. What's up?"". Whenever I hear the words or see someone label someone themselves as transgender, I can't help to feel weirded out by the fact they are even saying it.  So, I am hoping maybe if I understand it more, I can get rid of that feeling. There must be something I am missing for something so glaringly obvious.&#x200B;Edit: Thanks for the responses, I won't be answering to anymore though. My view has been changed.",""
"52","CMV: I don’t think there is anything that is not okay to joke about.","I recently had a debate with someone who thought that certain things are not okay to laugh at and I completely disagree.I think EVERYTHING can be funny if the joke it told the proper way. I would even say I’ve probably heard/seen something funny about every serious, sad, horrific and distressing subject matter.There is one main prerequisite that needs to be met for everything to be okay to joke about. * Time & place: I don’t think unsolicited jokes will be received well and that’s understandable. In passing, on the street, at work, at school or even among friends. If someone comes to a show or chooses to watch/listen to media with jokes, I think that those are the few places where *everything* is okay to joke about. Telling a sexist joke to someone while they are looking for their brand of bread at the store is not the time. So given the proper time and place, I think everything has the green light. I am not saying just because a joke takes places in a situation that is proper will make the joke funny by the way. I’m not saying no one will be offended, doesn’t make it less funny for some either. There is nuance, there is talent when it comes to jokes. Not everyone can write and or perform them as well as others.So let’s see if you can come up with something that I have not found humorous.

"53","CMV: I think the only reason there isn’t as much blow back from men portraying/acting like women is because of transgenderism","When it comes to actors portraying someone that doesn’t match their actual weight or ethnicity, there has been some issues. Simpsons, Family Guy & Big Mouth all had white actors who played non white characters and it was a “problem” and they switched it up.Tyler Perry, [Brendan Fraser](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/brendan-fraser-oscars-2023-fatphobic-49114114/amp), Martin Lawrence, Eddie Murphy & Robin Williams have caught flack for wearing fat suits. When it comes to white actors playing non white characters, there is a racist history in the US behind that. Some shows were performed that highlights stereotypes.There is a sexist past in different cultures (Greek and Japanese for example) when it comes to women on stage. They simply were not allowed. No equality there. No opportunities for the same position. So if a racist past is enough to stop a white actor from playing a black character, why not a male playing a female?On Fox when it comes to two shows that had an issue with a white person playing a non white character, they have another show where men play 3/4 characters. Big Mouth as well has a man playing a female character. Why is that not an issue?I think because some men like to dress as women and or like to perform drag, not much is said about those occurrences. Drag shows seem pretty similar to minstrel shows to me. Non women highlighting/exaggerating stereotypical female behavior.

"56","CMV: I believe that U.S. Organ Donation Should be a soft Opt-out system, not opt-in."," This argument was probably already said before. But organ donation is something I feel like everyone should do. I know some hard opt-out policies infringe on individual body liberties and choices(government taking) and also religious complications. It was stated that 95% of Americans are in favor of organ donations, but only 58% are actually registered (Donor Network West 2023). So how do we get the 37% of people to register to donate? A Soft Opt-out organ donation system, where everyone is defaulted “presumed” to want to be an organ donor. Those who do not want to donate would be able to opt-out easily through a nationwide website registry. Under this opt out policy:* Those who are above 18 will be automatically added to a donor registry* Those who are under 18 will still need parental consent to be added to the donor registry, but will automatically be added once they are 18.* Individuals who are unable to make their own decisions will still be added to the donor network registry, but their Next of Kin or legal guardian can opt-out for them.* To be added to the registry you need to be a US citizen or have a SSN* Anyone during anytime can opt-out of becoming an organ donor* During a death of a patient who did not opt-out, a representative from a donor network will talk to the family and “authorize” the default of donation in terms of the status quo. This gives the family an opportunity to ensure the potential donor’s preferences are regarded, in the event they have not opted out for whatever reason.I feel like this is similar to the current opt-in system. Where if someone dies, whether they are a donor or not, a representative from a donor network still goes and asks about organ donation. But in the opt-out system, a representative goes and authorizes the default decision of organ donation if the person did not opt out. This principle goes on the assumption that people will just go with the default choice on what society normally does. By normalizing organ donation, we can increase the number of organ doners.It can make the Next of Kin less stressed during this time because they do not need to think about what person actually wanted, because if they didn't want to donate they would have opted out. In the event the Next of Kin does not want to donate(and the deceased did not opt out), then we would go by what the Next of Kin wanted (similar to the current organ donation process). I feel like this would be the best of both worlds policy. It may increase the organ donation pool in a sense that people will want to go by the status quo, but still take into consideration family and religious views, so they can opt out for the deceased.Would there be any downsides to this policy?Edit:Interesting point of views. A lot of comments mention that it may be hard to opt out. So my plan would just change it from""Please check this box if you want to be a doner."" To""Everyone is automatically registered to be a donor. If you do NOT want to be a doner. Please check this box.""If they didn't check the box, they can always visit a website to be taken off the registry. The point is its just as easy to go off the list compared to opting in under the current system.",""

I get that it probably won't take long for the AI programs to catch on, but a temporary solution is better than no solution. Also I believe that our insistance on everyone using the same exact wording every time can be distracting. For example, are you still paying attention or were you distracted by the fact that I spelled 'insistence' with an 'a'? Is that level of distraction really the fault of the writer if their point is clear anyway? Yes, their our homophones. But these are usually cleared up by context.

"59","CMV: People are just generally too stupid to have a say in anything, including me.","Not a native speaker so be patientLately I feel like i just don't believe that people are smart enough to argue anymore. People are too stupid to understand simple things, people are misinformed, critical with information they don't agree with and yet at the same time those people can't view some other information critically. People are divided, unteachable, unchangeable. It doesn't make sense to sway people in the ""right"" direction by talking to them, trying to change their view. It is far easier to manipulate the masses and ignore the individual. They will follow, or maybe they won't - they are only one in a hundred.Politicians are just saying the same phrases over and over without engaging in meaningful conversations, the public doesn't think, neither while criticising nor while praising said politicians. People just go with their gut, people love to think they are smart, and most of the time they are not. People are simply to stupid and there is no sign of change if we don't go with the populism route, doesn't matter if we sway them to the left or right, in the end they didn't understand, they just believe.Everyday is see more and more idiots, i am at a point at which I think way over half the population of my country is too stupid to grasp simple concepts. I don't expect everyone to study every topic that the general public discusses, but maybe, just maybe people should at least lean their individual bias towards the opinion of experts that know what they are talking about. All of this includes me. I am no better. I am an expert at some things but I want to discuss all the things. I can be manipulated and I probably will be in the future. All of this leads me to believe that people are too stupid for almost anything. Trust me, i want my mind to be changed, i want to be able to believe that people as a whole can become informed again. People will learn to use the digital inventions as tools rather than a weapon. Misinformation and manipulation of the masses will be stopped. But right now, I don't believe that. (Quick heads up, i would like my view to be changed regarding a big group of people, i am aware that deep meaningful conversations can happen at a personal level, we can't go around and ""enlighten"" everybody one by one though, and who would I be to assume that my way of thinking is superior? I don't want to push my view onto other people, i just want everyone to have a view that they can argue with facts and a solid fundament. Not with the 5 sentences they hear repeated over and over on television)TLDR: I believe people don't know anymore, don't think anymore. They just believe. Therefore they are to stupid to be trusted with important stuff like voting or whatever. I believe this is true for all ends of the political and social spectrums.

"60","CMV: Voting should be mandatory in democratic countries","Listen up, folks! In democratic countries, low voter turnout is a serious problem that cannot be ignored. [According to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, more than 70 countries around the world hold elections where less than half of eligible voters actually cast their ballot.](https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout) The United States is a perfect example of this. [In the 2016 presidential election, voter turnout was only 55.7%](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=McDonald's%20voter%20turnout%20data%20for,VAP) - that's less than 6 out of 10 eligible voters who actually took part in deciding the future of their country. How can we call this a true democracy?That's why I firmly believe that mandatory voting is the solution we need. Mandatory voting would not only help ensure that every citizen has a say in their government, but it would also encourage greater civic engagement and political awareness. Critics argue that forcing people to vote is a violation of their individual freedom, but I call BS on that. In reality, not voting is just as much an act of political expression as casting a lottery. When people choose not to vote, they're effectively letting other people make decisions for them. And let's be honest, those people are usually the ones with the most money and power. If we want to level the playing field and make sure everyone has a say in government, mandatory voting is the way to go.Now, you might argue that forcing people to vote will lead to uninformed or careless voting. But let me tell you, this is not the case. Look at Australia, where voting has been mandatory for decades. Their voter turnout consistently hovers around 90%, and there's no evidence that people are making random or careless decisions at the polls. In fact, mandatory voting has actually increased civic engagement and political awareness among the population. In Brazil, where mandatory voting was introduced in the 1930s, voter turnout is around 80%, compared to the 40% seen in the US.mandatory voting is just one of many factors that affect voter turnout, and it can't be expected to solve all the problems on its own. But we need to start somewhere, and mandatory voting is a no-brainer.Some opponents of mandatory voting may argue that it is difficult to enforce, and that people will simply show up to the polls and spoil their ballot. However, there are ways to address these concerns. In Australia, for example, those who fail to vote without a valid reason are fined. And in Brazil, voters who fail to cast their ballot without justification can face a range of penalties, including being banned from getting a passport or a driver's license.So, what's the holdup? Let's make voting mandatory and ensure that every voice is heard. And don't give me any of that ""freedom"" nonsense – the freedom to stay home and do nothing is not a freedom worth fighting for. The benefits of mandatory voting are clear: higher voter turnout, more representative governments, and greater civic engagement. If you think you can change my view, you better come with some real facts and figures. Because mandatory voting is a no-brainer, and it's time we made it a reality..",""

"63","CMV: Joel made the right choice in the last of us finale","Firstly, I’d like to say that I believe Joel did the right thing in a general sense. Not the right thing by the world nor by Ellie.Sections of my reasoning: 1.) “First, do no harm” 2.) Reliability and probability3.) Who will be in possession of the resulting vaccine. 4.) Choice “First, Do no harm” This is the first phrase that new doctors recite when they become Medical Doctors during the Hippocratic oath. This phrase comes from Hippocrates work “Of the epidemic”. In this work, among other things Hippocrates states: “The physician must be able to tell the antecedents, know the present, and foretell the future—must mediate these things, and have two special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm” The key take away from this is that no modern physician weighs the good of many more than the good of a few. If this weren’t the case we would kill hundreds of people a year to save thousands waiting on the transplant list. Hippocrates states “Know the present, foretell the future” which leads me to my next point. The probability that the operation that kills Ellie results in a vaccine is unknown. While the firefly surgeon is hopeful that it will be a positive outcome, they have no way of knowing what the actual result would be. Could the vaccine actually be made? Could it cause a mutation that would be worse? Could it all be for nothing if cordyceps evolves to counter the vaccine? With so many variables, the only thing that is a sure thing is the death of Ellie. The surgeon is ensuring death of his patient for the small chance of ending the apocalypse. The surgeon is violating the sacred oath he took. Rationally, it makes no sense. Secondly, let’s say that the operation went through, Ellie died, and a vaccine was successfully made. Who has possession of it? The firefly’s, who for better or worse are just the apocalyptic version of the Taliban. A terrorist group using indiscriminate explosives to wage war on a regime in the name of freedom. Do you think they’d sing songs with FEDRA while equally giving access to the vaccine for everyone? No, probably not. they’d use it as tool for their own personal gain. Now, let’s say that FEDRA, The firefly’s, and every other group all got along and wanted to disperse the vaccine. Looking at Covid, do you think that the remaining survivors would openly agree to a vaccine? I don’t think the vast majority of them would even consider getting the vaccine, let alone even allow people close enough to them without violence. Even if the vaccine was created, and that’s a huge if, the distribution and handling of it would never work.Lastly, Ellie deserves the power to make the choice for herself. Before Joel and Ellie reach the hospital Ellie directly states plans for after she “saves the world”. Which if I’m not mistaken didn’t include dying less than a few hours later. This shows she had no intention of dying as a result of the operation. Marlene decided to not tell Ellie that she would die as a result of the operation, she lies to her in order to “protect” her.

"65","CMV: Fighting serves no purpose in hockey anymore and should just be banned.","I grew up watching and enjoying fighting in ice hockey, but over the years I've come to find it to be a bit of a sideshow. Hockey is a sport that rewards speed, coordination, reaction time, and physicality. The idea that you're just going to stop that game every now and then for a bareknuckle boxing match -when you really think about it- is kind of absurd. The typical argument you hear in favour of fighting is that it serves as a form of ""self-policing"" among players. Outside of a few anecdotes, I'm not sure this is supported by any data. Leagues where fighting isn't permitted don't have a higher incidence of violent, illegal hits. In my experience, it's leagues where fighting is more pronounced that have a tendency to be more goon-ish in general. Just look at the old NHL. I don't think anyone would suggest that since the NHL made fighting more rare, the league has become more violent or dangerous. Quite the opposite, it's proved that a different approach to officiating can ensure player safety without fighting. If anything, it's clear that fighting is more of a hazard to player safety than anything. How many guys end up with serious health issues stemming from that repeated head trauma, to say nothing of those who have actually been killed on the ice?It creates a race to the bottom, where teams feel they need to have players on the ice whose value is derived from being obscenely physical. Since the opposing team has one of those players, you need one too, and so on. Then there's a critical mass of players on either team who can't really contribute beyond their ability to potentially hurt other players. It's just an arms race. I think the real argument for fighting is that some fans enjoy watching it. It's not about player safety. It's not about the 'code.' But if you want to watch a fight, watch MMA. The NHL's rule changes that have greatly restricted fighting have also allowed it to become a more graceful, skillful game. I'd rather see the Cale Makars and Connor McDavids of the world do what they do then see a few guys who can barely skate rearrange each other's faces a couple times a game.",""
"66","CMV: Movie critics should stop reviewing MCU movies","Ok now this isn't necessarily a fully-formed opinion, but I think there's something here so please hear me out and help me poke some holes in it.Many critics of the latest few Marvel/MCU movies (e.g. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Thor: Love and Thunder) have left reviews along the lines of ""there are too many Marvel movies, the tropes are tired and the beats are predictable"". Is this a valid opinion to have? Yes, of course. ...Is this a useful criticism of the 35th installation in a superhero movie franchise? I would say no.My opinion is that MCU movies reached a point (probably after the Infinity War saga*) of being nerdy enough that the only people in the public still watching them, are people that have watched all/most of them, enjoy the superhero trope, and appreciate the weird universe-expanding format.At this point it's like a comic franchise... imagine if critics reviewed each new Marvel comic by saying ""there are too many superhero comics, the tropes are tired"". That's not a fair criticism of a Marvel comic, so should it be of a Marvel movie?The critics' Rotten Tomatoes score of Quantumania is 47, and the audience's score is 83. This to me perfectly illustrates that the consumers of Marvel movies are generally much more bought into the format, than the average critic. People who are sick of superhero movies are no longer watching these movies, and will not go see the next movie depending on critics' opinions.  So to round up my opinion, I think that most critics should stop reviewing most MCU movies. Maybe some stand on their own as fun stories and can be watched in isolation, but the more world building weirdness there is, the worse this will get, and at one point critic reviews will be completely useless.",""
"67","CMV: Debating about ""robots rights"" outside the realm of science fiction is ridiculous","I love robot stories. I think it's really interesting to think about how robots would be integrated in our society, from the most basic ones to complex IAs that could perfectly mimic human behaviour. It's an interesting thought-experiment that can also serve really well as social commentary.But that's what it is for me: fiction. I can't take the idea of robots having rights seriously. A robot, no matter how advanced, complex and human like, would be nothing more than a home appliance. It would be a human creation, just like cars, not a human, not an animal, they wouldn't even be sentient, just lines of codes mimicking human behaviour and thinking, depending solely on our tendency to anthropomorphize non-human things. Giving robots rights is no different than giving an intelligent fridge rights.I often see discussions about robots popping up here and there, with some fervent defendants that they should have rights as long as they reach the point where they ""act just like humans"" (which is a problematic view for whole other reasons, like ""what does acting like humans mean? So less intelligent robots that couldn't pass as humans wouldn't have rights? Why not?""), but for me a robot with human like intelligence still holds less value than a fly (of course, I'm talking about the ""value of life"" here, not monetary or personal importance).",""
"68","CMV: The new prevalence of remote work is bad for anybody who doesn't WFH","I live in North Idaho, in a city that used to be almost entirely blue collar. Rural lifestyle, conservative politics, all that. It's always been a bit of a resort town, and then a few years ago a huge number of celebrities bought vacation homes here and drove thousands of people to move here.I'll preface the rest of this by saying I am *not* a Conservative and my ideology aligns with very few of my neighbors. I'll also say that while I'm specifically talking about my city, this has happened to any notable city in the West, including Montana, Wyoming, Utah, smaller cities in Washington and Oregon, and so on.In my area, there's always been a general dislike among locals towards people who move in from other states, namely California, Washington, and Oregon. A lot of that dislike was/is based in the idea that people from blue states would somehow corrupt Idaho's politics, which wasn't, and isn't, the case.The other reason people have been wary of outsiders is because we know they're bringing big money with them. Even before the pandemic, people were selling their homes in California and building McMansions worth five times the median home price here. Obviously that helps the economy of the city and state, but it has driven a huge increase in the wealth gap here for over a decade. However, it wasn't a *significant* problem until 2020, when the widespread adoption of work from home policies led droves of people to move to more ""affordable"" cities, especially those with excellent outdoor access and reasonable proximity to bigger cities. I'm sure part of that is driven by the new-ish trendiness of ""wellness"" and the general fetishization of the aesthetics of outdoor, healthy life. There's a cryotherapy spot downtown now, a few vitamin IV places, countless juice bars, and *so much yoga.* I'm not saying I hate these things, but nobody I know who's from here is into that stuff. I also don't hate the people who move here - I totally understand (and unfortunately now empathize with) the idea of moving to a more affordable city.Anyway, my rent has literally doubled since the pandemic. My parents' house's value doubled. Hotels were booked out because people trying to move here were waiting for a home to buy or rent. Several friends and coworkers were priced out of the city (population 55,000, I might add). Property taxes have become untenable for some. The second an older home goes on the market, it's bought and flipped. There's no opportunity for upward mobility for almost any local. There's no affordable city to move to within a few hundred miles, because people from here fled to them and most of them were equally affected by the crisis.I know that work from home isn't the sole reason for the housing crisis (which has affected most of the US), but I strongly believe it has played a leading role in the problems we now face. People like myself, my family, my friends, my neighbors, who used to be able to lead a comfortable, affordable life, have been squeezed out of the middle class (which, I know, has been shrinking for decades) to the point of near-poverty. The income gap here is unbelievable now, and I'm sure it's the same in many other cities. Remote work made up 61% of work in 2020, and now sits at 29%.",""

"70","CMV: Veganism is a radical ideology similar to a cult that is not really defendable rationally.","EDIT 1: I meant it figuratively, yeah, the title was rather clickbaitry, sorry about that, but I still think most (not all, of course) vegans are inherently very strict in their values and guidelines, much more than the more vast animal-eco-friendly community of Vegetarians. I myself like the practice of pescatarians.  EDIT 2: I have seen many people calling me out for strawmaning and also people arguing that there are many more important reasons to be vegan apart from the philosophical/ethical one . It is my fault for not being clear enough that I'm all in for the environmental and harm reduction aspect of VEGETARIANISM and even VEGANISM which just want a better world. But my main point was to try and present a counter argument to all the times I tried to ask vegans why not eat humane-dairy, or pound fish or shrimp and only heard the aforementioned ""it against what it means to be vegan"" or ""causing pain to an animal with nervous system is wrong"". By all mean I know not 100% of vegans think like this, but I dare say the majority when confronted with some more ""specific questions"" would resort to some pre-made answers without puting much thought about it. \-----\-----The reason is that every discussion regarding health and environment can be eventually dealt with moderation and a model that reduces animal suffering but don't completely stop using their products all together. The problem with veganism is ultimately its central dogma that can be summed in a single sentence:""All suffering of sentient beings must be avoided by humans if possible even at high cost"".This is further extrapolated as follow:- If an animals possesses a nervous system, no matter how simplistic it is, then it needs to to have equivalent rights as humans because by having nervous system, such animal is thus ""sentient"" and thus ""capable of suffering"".This line is extremely arbitrary, by a simple philosophical and neuropsychologic point of view, this extrapolation of the definition of ""suffering"" is absurd. Like a small child that covers their teddy bears with a sheet so they can be more comfortable, Vegans, are people that seem to have confused empathy and projections to how actually emotions are formulated on a human brain. Nevermind the fact that vegans try to preach this dogma and all the full set of rules of how to live like a cult-like religion, and fail to understand that moral is relative. If a group of people fail to impose their moral view to other group, they are the one seen as immoral by the other group.\- This is also another point I often seen being misused a lot lately: Not understanding the difference between moral and ethics, and how moral is relative to specific set of values of a group, and not necessarily superior to a different group's set of values. Only religious people deals in absolutist morals, secular people trend, however, with a more logical approach in the field of formal ethics. Sometimes we see vegans trying to arguments about how ""harming another animal is unethical"" and that is also a misconception that I'll deal ahead:Returning to the problem of suffering, one can draw several deconstructionists rhetorics to dismantle the need of veganism in the first place:a) How can one objectively define SUFFERING from simple animals such as insects, bees or even fish? If you consider the concept of qualia in philosophy, the answer is pretty simple: It can't be. it is all subjective projection from human perspective. Thus the second point:b) Why avoid negative neurological stimuli at all? Why is it so bad? Isn't pain part of life? Would a pup deprived of all negative stimuli in all of its life even mature properly?\- Stating that ALL negative stimuli should be avoided at all costs is, again, ARBITRARY. Why stop at natural life and neurons? Modern A.I. simulations can be based on two types of simplistic stimuli to evolve a neural-network: avoidable and pursuable stimuli equally to a simple insect, in fact there are computer simulations more complex than insects currently running in many Tech universities around the world, shouldn't anything causing negative stimuli be avoided at all costs even in artificial machines created by humans?c) Even if you ignore the concept of qualia or the definition of suffering, why draw the lines at neurons specifically and what kind of neurons one must possess to be considerable negatively enough of a stimuli? Nociceptors? - Plants also act according to positive and negative stimuli in nature (heat, cold, sunlight and even pressure-sensitive receptors i.e. Carnivore plants).d) If you must avoid ""negative stimuli"" of all animals possessing a nervous system, then shouldn't people also stop washing their faces altogether, as doing so kills hundreds of commensal mites that live in your eyelashes known as demodex? This is an example of how extremely low this line has been drawn and how ihenrently an appeal to emotion it is.In fact as someone with a Neuropsychology background and following the concept of simple negative stimuli being simply a biological mechanism that doesn't generate suffering in itself, suffering is a far more complex HUMAN concept, and extrapolating it to any simple negative stimuli is a misplaced empathy projection at best. I can say with certainty that not only insects can't actually ""suffer"" like humans do, neither do other creatures such as crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks or even fish. Any attempt to try and compare a fish splashing on a deck to a human experiencing all the emotional trauma of suffocating is ludicrous.Allowing fish to ""feel pain"", or bees to work more for producing more honey to replenish the ones we take will not cause a quantum disbalance in the subatomic scale that would rip the fabric of space time apart or drag your soul to hell like your dogma makes people think it will. ""Pain"" does not annihilates gluons. This is just arbitrary oversensitivity nonsense that won't make you morally superior than omnivorous,There is however a much more complex discussion to be made about if higher mammals like pigs, dogs or cows actually experience ""suffering"" like humans and if self-awareness and consciousness are needed for that. I personally would draw the line in not causing suffering to animals with consciousness like great apes, cetaceans and some birds (no, chickens definitely do not have enough telencephalon to have consciousness even if they do feel pain), you can try and bring the bar down to cows and pigs too and I'd gladly bring qualia back again to justify how without consciousness this is only projection and oversensitivity, but that is a much longer discussion and also, irrelevant, because fundamentally vegans only bring the suffering of pigs dogs and cows as an appeal to emotion of how much they suffer compared to our precious little pets, the inherent fundament of Veganism has already been deconstructed above. You can chose to not eat cows or pigs because you personally feel bad about then, that is absolutely fine, But there is absolutely no logic in refraining from eating shrimp, tuna or honey. Because there is no reason to follow an arbitrary line created by a cult-like pseudoscientific dogma.Now, one may extrapolate and try to ignore the moral core of veganism and try to formulate environmental and health arguments, but for those, you aren't trending within the veganism radical bonds anymore and we can start and construct a more sensible argument in favor of more sustainable and ""humane"" pecuarian production instead of completely and nonsensically getting entirely rid of it.",""

There is an edge case where these comments may cause a poster to check more carefully before submitting a post.

"73","CMV: Politicians, the news Media, and even social media mods do not do enough to remind people that disliking/hating a foreign government should not be applied to citizens of those nations.","I am Chinese. I came here when I was two and grew up in this country (US). I went to school here. I work here. I pay my taxes. I do my part as a human of this planet to give back to charities and organizations that better the community, the world, and the earth.What I am currently seeing by way of political rhetoric is that China is bad. And I recognize the US and China have had economic/political competition for decades but it seems now things are more tense than ever. I see it both from the left and the right. On Reddit, I often see 'fuck china' this and 'fuck china' that - even for non-political posts. It's pretty intense.   Given the political climate, and angry rhetoric from both sides of the political spectrum, along with some of the shit I have seen on Reddit, it has created some level of anxiety in me - both for traveling purposes and just being more apprehensive about acknowledging a part of me that is outside my control. I guess we generally use 'fuck (country)' colloquially to mean fuck that country's govt but now it seems that phrase has expanded to create a suspicion and hatred towards Asians.I've travelled to different parts of the country and in predominantly white states, I get stares but I have not explicitly experienced any racism or prejudice - so far. That being said, I am a bit more apprehensive and cautious more than ever about traveling to certain parts of this country due to the rise of Asians being targeted with assault, etc, so it's definitely happening.I'd like to think most Americans can separate hatred of the Chinese govt from Chinese citizens or Chinese people living in this country but I am not always confident in American exceptionalism due to some of the angry rhetoric I have seen in the news and media. Culturally, I am assimilated into the American experience with minimal exposure even to my own background, but no matter what I say or do, I ultimately have no control over my physical ethnic traits and how strangers might perceive me based on their own political views.I fear that the lack of constant reminders from the news, politicians, social media platforms, means more people will blur the line or end up holding irrational prejudices against Chinese people - especially in America where people sometimes struggle with separating personal political values from an individual - sometimes even deliberately targeting Asians due to one's own political views. Even if one does not personally hate Chinese people, using language like 'Fuck China' seemingly only risks potentially extending that hatred beyond politics. We have seen this quite a bit with members of other minority groups. Since East Asians are distinctly and noticeably different compared to members of other groups, it is not easy to simply ""blend in.""I suppose hating the CCP isn't anything new and there are many reasons to not like the CCP but with the rise of media coverage on Asian people being targeted, and politicians not seemingly doing enough to remind people to separate govt from the people, there seems to be an immediate negative reaction when people drop the word 'China' and often people can find it difficult to separate hating 'The Chinese (the govt)' from hating 'The Chinese (a chinese person)'My take is that both the left and right politicians are not doing enough to remind people to adopt rhetoric that might be more appropriate such as expressing hatred towards a political party or politician instead of a whole country. Saying 'Fuck China' and 'Fuck the Chinese' seemingly encompasses the people, the culture, the good **vs** 'Fuck the Chinese Govt' or 'Fuck the CCP' 'Fuck Xi' which makes it far more clear that one's discontent is not with the people but rather only with the government.Politicians and the news media can do more to help change the rhetoric and remind all of us to separate politics from the people. We all say we know it but it doesn't seem to be emphasized enough. I believe we should adopt an approach with the way we use our language that minimizes risks of people letting their political views against a government transfer to become prejudice or even racism against someone who might be from a certain country. Not just for China but with Iran, with Russia, or any state that we have deemed to be antithetical to America's values.Some may argue free speech but I'd challenge these people if we can be more precise in our language if it means it can minimize potential fueling of hatred and racism, etc.   Thanks for reading.",""

"76","CMV: People make too big of a deal about tipping culture","I get it, you’re already spending seven dollars on a coffee but if you’re doing that you probably have a dollar or two more to spare, however that’s not even my main point.So often I hear people saying, “tipping culture has gotten out of hand.” I don’t agree with capitalism or the way we currently treat service workers and agree that businesses should 100% foot the bill to pay employees a living wage. However, that is not the system we currently live under and in the real world today, most service workers do not make a living wage and rely heavily on tips.Here’s my thing; nobody is making you tip. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. But it irks me when people are anti-tip but try to spin it into being a workers rights thing. No, you’re not tipping because you believe employers should pay their workers more and you think they deserve a living wage. You’re not tipping because you simply don’t want too. That’s fine, but don’t try to make it sound like you are some kind of pro-worker amazing person. When you don’t tip a server you are essentially screwing them over in the current system because nobodies rising up to change how restaurants pay them. I get it more for other businesses but again, nobodies making you tip. I think it’s good that more businesses are offering tip options. Should it be necessary? No. But in the system we live under I think it’s great that there’s an option, option being the key word, for a barista or cashier to make a dollar or two more during a transaction. If you feel like it do it, if you don’t then don’t. But when people just outright dismiss tipping as a whole it makes me think you just don’t want to feel guilty for not doing it and you put that higher than the positives it can bring for the worker. I think it’s good in todays system for there to be an option for people to make a little more money.Edit: I’m not saying people who don’t tip don’t actually care about workers rights but choosing to not tip a service person seems like an odd way of showing support. I get the idea in theory but let’s be honest, the tipping system isn’t changing anytime soon and you not doing it is not making some big statement to big business it’s just not giving extra money to a single worker, which is fine if you don’t want too. I guess it just bugs me that people act like them not tipping is some big act of rebellion against big business, they don’t care and the workers are the ones feeling the brunt.Edit 2 - I almost put in the US in the title because I figured people would assume since tipping is much more of a thing here than other places but yes, I am specifically talking about the US.",""

Many of these VCs are calling for the government to step up and pay depositors back their money beyond the insured FDIC $250K.I don’t think taxpayers should be forced to bankroll rich, Silicon Valley executives, most of which are tech bro white men from rich families and networks who could easily make up the funds lost privately.I’m a founder of a tech startup. I have raised money from investors. I have learned the ins and outs of my industry and have lots of fellow VC-backed founder friends. But I don’t think the general taxpayer should be responsible to pay back private deposits that were lost due to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank’s management and the VCs who caused the bank run that led to its demise. If it were me, I’d figure out a way to operate within the insured amount of funds or put my money in various banks for more security. The same VC investors who are so gung-ho about capitalism and have no qualms about screwing the poor and middle classes for their own wealth are now expecting the government, and the general population, to bail them out of something they brought upon themselves.Yes, some of these startups will have to shut down as a result. But being an entrepreneur is about being able to be scrappy, manage resources effectively, and operate in times of uncertainty. Those that fail due to this SVB situation probably were not using the capital efficiently anyway (maybe that private jet and those fancy dinners weren’t the best use of funds, eh?). Startups fail all the time because of forces out of their control. This is no different and it shouldn’t be taxpayers’ problem.CMV!EDIT: 1. I’ve gotten a lot of people who assume I don’t know anything about how companies, startups, or VC funding works. I do. I own a tech C-Corp and have a cap table with investors. We run payroll and have multiple business banking and credit accounts. We are early stage and have not raised hundreds of millions of dollars yet, but I understand how it works.2. I want to clarify that I don’t think these startups should automatically fail. But I think this ‘bailout’ should be dealt with using private funds vs a government purchase or agreement requiring general taxpayers - especially from groups that are consistently and systemically discriminated against by the very investors crying for help right now - to foot the bill for SVB’s collapse.EDIT 2: Parts of my view have been changed - I do think the depositors should be made whole to pay employees and so businesses can continue operating. However, the part of my view that still stands is that US taxpayers should not be responsible for it. These are things I still believe can be fixed with private funds: additional venture capital infusions, loans, corporate buyouts, whatever.A lot of interesting comments and conversations are happening here, and I've replied to a lot of them.

Explains why criminals of all degrees were usually forced into their life due to environmental factors (such as poverty).Explains why in American style prisons the return rate is 76%, while in Denmark where they have much different prison environments, the return rate overall is only 27% & in open prisons the return rate is 19%. Keep in mind that the open vs closed prison are in Denmark, so that percentage difference is due to environment. Denmark figured out that if you treat people like humans/give help while in prison & more importantly out of prison. Then those people are much less likely to commit crimes.

Even though they were all genetically identical, raised in the same country/state (which is a big deal actually), they all came out very different. I mean people were really trying to force them to seem alike & even then it was clear how different they were personality wise. One of the brothers specifically was so damaged from his past, that he ended up committing suicide. Explains why depending on the country you were born in, that your IQ varies. I mean it varies by A LOT, even just a 15 point different in IQ is huge. Yet as it turns out, countries with IQ average above 95 are mostly wealthier nations (compared to the world). While countries that are very poor, rank low in IQ, many in the low 80/mid 70 IQ range & a fair amount in the 60 range. Some countries like Nepal and couple others were in the 40 IQ range. Source: https://wisevoter.com/country-rankings/average-iq-by-country/Please include this specific point when providing a counter argument:Also something that has to be explained if the belief that genetics plays a bigger role than environment. That something is the IQ gap not only in poorer countries, but minorities in America vs White people. There is a significant IQ gap between the average Black American vs a White American. If the the belief that genetics plays a bigger part than environment. Then by default the explanation for IQ gaps are due to genetics, therefore you would also have to say that minorities are less intelligent than white people genetically. With the big racial discrimination implications aside, I find that explanation hard to believe. Because even asian countries like Nepal scored very, very low on IQ tests, as well as African, middle eastern and so on. What those countries & the minorities in America have in common is their wealth (aka environment), not genetics.Source: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-black-white-test-score-gap-why-it-persists-and-what-can-be-done/amp/So again, I believe that the environment plays the biggest factor in peoples outcomes, compared to their genetics.

"81","CMV: I consider Christians to be frauds if they haven't read through the Bible at least once throughout their life.","I've recently started reading the Bible (usually to fall asleep at night) and have made it halfway through Genesis. Whenever I converse with Christians, it seems that many Christians have not delved deep into their religious text beyond simply reading scripture during Bible study. I am an agnostic, so I'm still exploring my own beliefs, but even if I were to believe in God, I don't think it would necessarily align with the Christian conception of a deity. Another reason I am reading through the bible is that many video games and media entertainment have religious references. For example, Assassin Creed: Odyssey and the God of War series made me more interested in studying Greek Mythology. I started to study Christian Mythology and have encountered interesting stories like Paradise Lost and the Tower of Babel, which had created a lot of insightful discussion with experienced Christians.The Bible contains material that is fundamental to Christian belief, and it's generally considered important for Christians to read the Bible at least once in their lifetime. Many would argue that it's a crucial aspect of their faith. I estimate the Bible to be the length of about two Harry Potter novels, and many people in the world have read the Harry Potter series. Anyways, if they truly have faith in a deity, then why wouldn't they invest the time on learning about such deity? It doesn't make sense to me.",""
"82","CMV: ""Trumps"" Banking Deregulation was NOT a bad thing","I've been seeing a lot on Reddit that Trump caused the recent banking failure because he passed the 2018 Economic Growth Act, and that he was deregulating banks which caused this crisis. It seems most people didn't even read the bill or understand why it was recommended by researchers at Harvard Kennedy School (people much smarter than that orange baboon). This was done for reasons outside MAGAland.Since the Dodd-Frank Act got passed all banks with more than $10 billion in assets were treated much the same way; this is good right? All banks get regulated? Well, there were more second-order effects than regulators realized; these banking regulations were applied to tiny, regional, and commercial banks even though they had nothing to do with the MBS shenanigans that resulted in the financial crisis.**Regional and community banks had nothing to do with the financial crisis.** These are the banks that service communities and sectors that high finance regularly avoids. They did not have capital markets desks that traded MBS or speculated in OTC derivatives. They were focused on lending to mom and pop shops and helping fund their local communities in rural, more agriculture focused areas. For example, over 50% of small business loans made in the US were serviced by these community and regional banks and over 70% of agriculture loans were issued by regional banks. These banks only hold **20**% of the total capital in the financial sector. These banks focus on places that JP Morgan and Goldman don't give a shit about.Regulations were killing small banks' ability to compete and were leading to a rapid concentration of wealth among the biggest banks;JP Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, etc.Regulators and researchers feared that having most of the wealth in the country concentrated in these banks would lead to increased wealth inequality as the regional and community banks were the only banks available in low-income communities, historically disenfranchised communities, and agricultural communities that did not have access to these financial giants.The regulations crippled small banks' ability to compete with large banks in a number of ways: One is that the vast number of regulatory compliance that Dodd-Frank enacted required massive compliance departments and legal teams that banks like JP Morgan could stomach the costs for, while a smaller bank would be completely gutted by. For example, hiring just two compliance officers **reversed** the profitability of a smaller bank.JP Morgan has over **4 trillion** in assets. *A smaller regional bank would have less than 1% of that.*The SVB debacle was caused by rising interest rates making the bank's HTM securities hit badly; SVB wasn't trading Dogecoin or some other random nonsense; it was holding a variety of low-default risk bonds and securities. This was a Black Swan Event not caused by simple deregulation, but rather a lack of analysis by the government and poor management by the bank caused by a decade of low rates and optimism. SeekingAlpha and short seller Marc Cohodes rang the alarm on SVB months ago, why did the government not step in a long time ago, isn't that their job?LCR requirements were on banks of over $75 billion in assets, shouldn't their liquidity coverage ratio have triggered alarm bells for regulators? Other risk-based capital ratios were also required and SVB was not going under the radar as it WAS a category 3 bank. **This was not a regulatory failure.**The SVB case would be an entirely different post, looking at their HTM portfolio, balance sheet, and how it created a prisoner's dilemma in which Peter Thiel would trigger a bank run. It wasn't a 2008 situation where the bank did some goofy NINJA loans nonsense and went under.Big banks WANT regulators to pass more bills and restrictions on regional banks; it hurts their competition and makes capital flee to the big banks. Hurting commercial and regional banks hurts the little guy, and in many ways it might even hurt you, dear reader.Great resources that I've used for this post:[https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp37](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp37)[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/19/2018-08066/regulatory-capital-rules-regulatory-capital-enhanced-supplementary-leverage-ratio-standards-for-us](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/19/2018-08066/regulatory-capital-rules-regulatory-capital-enhanced-supplementary-leverage-ratio-standards-for-us)[https://www.mercatus.org/research/federal-testimonies/regulatory-landscape-burdens-small-financial-institutions](https://www.mercatus.org/research/federal-testimonies/regulatory-landscape-burdens-small-financial-institutions)[https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2018/05/23/how\_dodd-frank\_hurts\_the\_little\_guy\_110645.html](https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2018/05/23/how_dodd-frank_hurts_the_little_guy_110645.html)Edit: With regards to SVB balance sheet; holding Government Bonds changed to variety of low-default risk securities.

"83","CMV: AIs are not going to destroy industries as much as people think","I’m a travel agent of 20+ years and ever since Chatgpd went viral I’ve gotten more and more people (including my 21-year-old son) telling me that both my job and the whole travel agent industry will be made obsolete by AIs currently available like [Stravl](https://www.stravl.com) & [Chatgpd](https://chat.openai.com)I disagree. Sure, AI might be able to do some basic stuff & sound very convincing at it, but even with seemingly simple stuff (like planning a trip), it’s missing the distinctly human touch. For instance, it can find popular destinations and list information about them, but will it ever truly understand the nuances of what a human being wants to experience through travel?A large part of my job is talking to customers, asking them about themselves, & getting a feel for their travel preferences. There is so much human connection that goes into planning the perfect trip for them. I don’t think AIs will know what to ask people. I don’t think they can have that “human connection” with travelers. There’s just something about sitting across from a real human, who you know you can trust to make your trip extra special, that makes this process so much more enjoyable for travelers.I have tried some of the “Virtual Travel Agents” online & they seemed to have proven my points. Talking to a chatbot just seems awkward, untrustworthy, & fake. Maybe I’m just getting old, but is there not something special about having a human on your side that can step in if something goes wrong, that can listen to you, & personalize your vacation?Is it true that people don’t care about that “human touch” anymore?

"84","CMV: we should not be blaming Tems for obscuring people's views at the Oscars with her dress.","Social media was crazy this morning blaming Tems for her huge dress which may have blocked the views of people behind her. And people are being really aggressive about it on Reddit and Twitter. This aggression, in my opinion, is unfounded. What's more, I think it is premature to blame her at all. Here's my reasoning:1) If she was given the design beforehand, there is no reason to assume that she knew better. This is her first year being well known, whereas previously she was an unknown musician from Africa. I don't know anyone who has ever worn a dress that has a collar higher than their head. It's not exactly a common thing. So would the average person be able to immediately see from a design that that would be obstructing someone's view? Hard to say. Especially if you are not used to wearing performative pieces and going to events like that. If you were exceptionally tall, or usually wear hats, then maybe you would think of it. But as it stands, I have yet to be convinced that the average person would anticipate this.2) Once she got the dress, if she noticed it was too large, that would have been too late. For the most part, actresses do not wear dresses that they own to the Oscars. They sign a contract with a designer to showcase a dress. Often these dresses cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to make. So at that point she couldn't have just not worn it and could even have been sued for doing so. 3) Lastly, some people have commented online that Tems should have pushed the dress down or changed seats. You don't know if either of those were actual options. Changing seats probably would have been impossible for an event like that, and pushing the dress down could have damaged it. Plus, it's not even clear that the people behind her even _mentioned_ to her that they could not see. That is just pure speculation at this point",""
"85","cmv: I think that the existence of closed spaces exclusively for people of a marginalized identity is not inherently a bad thing.","There is this ongoing discourse about the existence of closed spaces for members of specific marginalized communities and a lot of progressives will say this is “self-segregation” or regressive. Let me say that I know there are people who, because of trauma or past experiences or honestly because sometimes people are just shitty, are way too eager to turn the tables and exclude the people groups who previously excluded them and I agree that insofar as that is the motivation, it is not something I support.However, there are plenty of legitimate reasons why marginalized people would want to have spaces primarily or even exclusively designed to cater to their needs and shared experiences because the wider world is still not safe for them. People from more mainstream identities (read: cis/het and white) may get legitimately upset by feeling excluded (exclusion is an ugly feeling), but they inhabit a world that is mostly built to cater to their needs and shared experiences so it’s not like they don’t have anywhere else to belong. Plus, a lot of times these spaces will welcome people outside their in-group so long as the guests don’t take up too much physical or emotional space in them. Maybe the most I am willing to sympathize with their perspective is that closed spaces not be intentionally hurtful when establishing and protecting boundaries.I think a lot of the discomfort from (mostly) white, cis/het progressives is that they are afraid that bigots could use similar rationalizations to try to re-establish whites-only, or straights-only spaces or whatever, but truth is:1) these things already exist (how many Black people do you see at country clubs, or how many gay people can be themselves openly at evangelical churches?) And2) marginalizing someone because of their identity is NOT the same as having a space that caters to people who share a common experience of marginalization.EDIT: I am surprised by how aggressive the backlash against this post is, especially since most people seem to be upset by something I explicitly said I was not endorsing.I literally said on the post that I do not support vindictive discrimination against people from the majority identities (e.g. white people, straight people, cis people, etc.) and that when I was talking about ""closed"" spaces I did not mean people weren't allowed in because they didn't belong to the specific marginalized identity, but rather that the space was specifically built to cater to the specific identity and that people outside that identity who chose to enter should be mindful to not take up too much physical (i.e. numerically overwhelm) or emotional (i.e. try to police the expression or embodiment of the people for whom the group was created) space.I will say there were a few comments which introduced nuances and arguments that were not already addressed in the original post, and to those few commenters I will say this:I think you convinced me that creating closed spaces for marginalized identities can open the door for discrimination to occur between marginalized identities (e.g. homophobia in Black spaces, racism in queer spaces, religious discrimination, etc.). This is actually a real problem and I need to become more informed about what can be done to prevent this from happening or if creating rigid boundaries around group identity will inherently lead to this problem. Thank you for bringing this up.Another concern I found compelling was the ability for potential allies to the marginalized group to experience camaraderie with marginalized peoples is minimized if they retreat into safe spaces which do not allow for much interaction with allies from the majority group. I think this is more something to look out for in specific instances than a problem at large since people of marginalized identities are often also part of diverse spaces (e.g. workplaces, schools, fandoms, etc.) to where it is very unlikely they will not build relationships with people outside their groups, but with the Internet and the increasing ability for people to retreat into echo chambers, I still think this concern is worth keeping in mind.Lastly, for those of you who immediately jumped into accusations of ""racism"" or ""segregation"" or bringing up examples of how ""white nationalists are marginalized, should they be free to create their own closed spaces?"" I will say this:Do you understand what racial segregation in the U.S. was like historically? Do you know how many Black churches and businesses were bombed and burned to the ground by the klan? How many activists and organizers were killed in cold blood, lynched, or otherwise had their lives ruined? How many murders of innocent Black people happened at the hands of police for ""crimes"" such as ""loitering"" or ""speaking to a white woman,"" or ""trespassing"" on public property?Do you know that until the 1960's, the U.S. had laws which prohibited certain nationalities or ethnicities from coming into the country legally? And how if people from these countries or nationalities came here illegally they had absolutely no legal protections because any attempt to try to advocate for themselves would get them deported or worse?Do you know that in the Southern border of the U.S. it is a crime to leave out food or water for migrants crossing the border? And that border patrol agents routinely search and destroy rations left out for migrants in the desert South of Arizona, New Mexico, and California? Or that one third of all agricultural workers in the U.S. are undocumented migrants who are payed well below the minimum wage, and are often turned in and deported by their employers after the harvest season is over and they have to cross the border yearly? Or that the reason they go through all that trouble is because American corporations have basically purchased the governments of many Latin American countries and absolutely destroyed their economies and any kind of labor protections? And that the U.S. literally had a military academy that taught fascist authoritarians how to overthrow democratically elected governments through military coups?Did you know that until the 1970s, being publicly gay or trans in the U.S. would get you forcibly sterilized, and in many cases also would get you imprisoned or institutionalized? Did you know that Ronald Reagan ordered the CDC under his administration to halt any mitigation efforts or research into treating or preventing AIDS because he viewed it as a divine punishment from God on the queer community, and it wasn't until the late 80's when straight white women started contracting the disease in significant numbers that he lifted that order? or that to this day, most states still accept gay/ trans panic as a defense for murdering queer people? or that recently leaked emails between Republican politicians and conservative influencers shows that part of the reason for all the anti-trans legislation that is getting passed right now is explicitly to cause more trans people to off themselves?Did you know that during the westward expansion, the U.S. military literally waged a war of extermination against Native Americans? Did you know that Native Americans have fought and won Supreme Court cases to prevent being forcibly relocated after surrendering to U.S. troops and the U.S. government relocated them anyways? In blatant violation of the Supreme Court! Or that some tribes were relocated multiple times because the land to which they were first relocated to was later found to have gold reserves, or oil, or simply to be desirable farmland, so the Native Americans who were forcibly moved there were again forced to relocate to basically wastelands? And that today, even in those badlands, the U.S. is still allowing businesses to build pipelines and other hazardous infrastructure through Native land without and against Native Americans' consent?So please, please, PLEASE, unless you can point me to examples of similar atrocities happening to the same scale and with the same impunity to white/cis/het people because marginalized people want to have localized closed groups for their own enjoyment and safety, PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU do not DARE compare the two.

Feel free to still comment just know that I’ve already changed my view significantly. —I always been perplexed when people get upset at the addition of (or someone saying they’d want an addition of) an easy mode to games that they enjoy.I’m someone who enjoys modes and will use a variety of modes depending on the mood I’m in/ how much time I have. If it’s a genre I’m familiar with and I feel like I challenge I would choose “hard.” If I’m not as into the gameplay for a game and just want to enjoy the story I’d have no problem choosing “easy.” For times where I’m feeling somewhere in-between I’ll choose “normal.”I really enjoy the flexibility of different difficulty modes in video games but see pushback against difficulty modes a lot so I wanted to hear other perspectives.I understand that some people always want a challenge, but I’m not sure how it affects their gameplay to simply choose “hard” and let others do as they wish.

"87","CMV: Most feminist groups only care about men's problems if they affect women","Tl;dr: Mainstream groups that aim for gender equality are useless at addressing issues that mostly affect men because they only really care about women.Usually when people bring up areas where men are worse off than women (e.g. college enrollment rates, suicide, homelessness, loneliness) and say that efforts should be made to address them, the response is that gender based issues already have a solution which is feminist groups. I'd argue that feminist groups shouldn't be left to solve them.It seems to me that **most** feminist groups only care about men's issues if they affect women. Recently I saw [this article linked](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/) and it describes how men are increasingly likely to be lonely. The article argues that this is a problem because it affects women who are stuck dealing with the men in their lives who are otherwise isolated. That these men are miserable is an afterthought.Similarly, boys who start to be exposed to Andrew Tate are seen as problems because of how they might behave later in life with women. Incels are problems because they might hurt women but the fact that they're lonely and miserable is ignored. Usually when feminist writers bring up the way women are a majority of college students, it leads to complaints that these women find dating harder and that they're more likely to struggle with student debt.It seems that if men would only be miserable, lonely and suicidal on their own and avoid women, these groups would be perfectly happy so I don't trust them to care about these problems beyond trying to further isolate the men affected.**EDIT: For all the people saying ""this is like asking the NAACP to care about anti-semitism"", I'd argue feminism portrays itself as fighting sexism and gender inequality, not a group for one demographic like the NAACP.**",""
"88","CMV: All this AI tech is good, actually + AI art is real art.","Disclaimer: I don't think it's okay to steal art in order to build your AI. Privacy is important.I see a bunch of CMVs about how all the new things about AI aren't that bad, implying that they think it's bad, just not \*very\* bad. Me, I think it's not bad at all. I actually think it's \*good\* and I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.This is not the first time we see people lose their jobs or worry about losing their jobs because of new technology. It happened with the Industrial Revolution when dozens of farmhands got replaced by a single tractor, and countless of other examples out there.It's not the first time something gets called ""not art"" because of how a machine was involved in its production. Back when photographs were new, people were malding about how photographs aren't real art, you just pressed a button and hurr durr I'm an artist. Nowadays we know better and professional photographers who do the photograph thing way better than I can exist and are paid for it. Although someone who can paint a picture manually tends to still be, to me, more impressive (when it comes to their skill) than a photographer who managed to take an outstanding picture.See that previous paragraph? I believe AI artists work the same way. It's not easy to make AI art -- I've tried to do it and by god, is it tough. You need to choose the right words, find the right prompts, pick the right seed -- sometimes even different AIs (compare a different AI with a different camera) because NovelAI is good at a specific thing while, say, character dot ai is good at another -- and then you have to comb through several pictures. Like with being a photographer, it takes effort and it IS fascinating to see what people can do, \*even\* if manual pictures are still more impressive. ...Just like fabric, too! I love me some industrial clothings, but if my mom makes something I can buy on the store with her own hands? Holy smokes.I don't think people losing their jobs for AI is an actual bad thing at a societal level; sure, it sucks for them and it'd suck for me if I were one of those people, but it's necessary (perhaps even healthy?

They have in fact, left bad beekeepers, but stay with good ones.So it is to say, that bees and beekeepers have a symbiotic relationship. The bees consent to the harvest of honey (by not relocating).

In the lab:- copious behavioural research has demonstrated that people do not think or make decisions the way econ thinks they should. Moreover people do not behave 'as if' they were econs - the outcomes of their decisions are different.In reality: - in my own field of environmental and climate economics, neoclassical assumptions have been profoundly damaging. They consistently suggest absurd decarbonisation pathways that rely on rates of land use change 3x faster than any observed in history. Such transitions are not only implausible, they are highly undesirable. The rapid pace of soybean uptake, e.g., has led led widespread spillover deforestation in the amazon. Econ denies such problems by assuming perfect policy oversight and an absence of counterproductive decisions. - more absurdly still, econ suggests 4degrees of warming is compatible with a growing economy, and indeed is the optimal tradeoff between costs of decarbonisation and climate damages. 4degrees of warming is borderline incompatible present day human societies. Therefore, neoclassical economics is not only false, but profoundly damaging, making absurd and unworkable policy recommendations in important areas of work.It should no longer be taught or researched.",""

Personally, I like the more personalized approach to spirituality. &#x200B;Monotheistic religions like Christianity is more limiting in terms of the range of beliefs and practices even though there are different denominations, as it requires its followers to place all their faith in a single deity. With polytheistic religions, I am not placing all my eggs into one basket.&#x200B;Also, I find the lore behind many polytheistic religions to be more interesting like the Greek Gods  than the Christian lore.",""

"97","CMV: STAR voting is superior to Instant Runoff Voting aka Ranked Choice.","STAR voting is a voting system where you give as many candidates as you want a 0-5 rating.  Then,  there's a stimulated runoff between the two candidates with the highest average ratings.  The candidate who is higher ranked on more ballots is the winner.For example, if you give Alice a rating of 5 and Bob a rating of 4, you count as a vote for Alice in a runoff between Alice and Bob.   If you gave them both a 5, you'd count as an obstention.This is a useful deterrent to certain kinds of strategic voting.  For example, suppose you're voting in a presidential election, and you're trying to maximize the chance of Bernie Sanders winning.  Naively, the way to do that is to give Bernie Sanders a 5 and everyone else a 0.  However,  the problem with that is if the runoff is actually between Elizabeth Warren and Trump, you've abstained even though you presumably prefer Warren to Trump.  Likewise if the runoff is between Warren and Biden,  Biden and Kasich or Kasich and Trump.  If you want your vote to count in the runoff, voting honestly is a far superior strategy than bullet voting. Instant runoff voting is a voting system where voters list their first, second, third, etc choices.  Then, if there's not a candidate with an absolute majority of the remaining votes, you eliminate the candidate with the lowest vote total and reallocate the votes to their next *remaining* preference.In IRV, your second place selection gets no support from you until your first place is eliminated, assuming your second place wasn't eliminated first.  This means that compromise candidates with a lot of second place support could easily be eliminated early, and that election order is very important.Instant runoff has some really weird edge cases because elimination order is very important to the results.  For example, in the 2009 Burlington mayoral election, the Progressive candidate won.   However, Republicans could have caused the Progressive candidate to lose by having the right number of Republicans put the Progressive as their top choice, or by staying home.IRV makes it so that voting for additional candidates can't hurt your favorite, but at the cost of making it riskier to support your favorite. [Ka Ping Yee has an interesting voting system visualizion, coloring in a 2d political compass by the color of the candidate who would win if the center of public opinion is within that area.](http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/)  Most systems produce sensible diagrams, but IRV produces the oddest looking diagrams, with shapes that make no sense.  STAR isn't on there, but it shouldn't look too much different from approval. [An important way to look at voting systems is 'Voter Satisfaction Efficiency'](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic), a measure of how happy people are with the results.  IRV is slightly better than plurality, but significantly worse than approval voting, STAR or 3-2-1.There's no such thing as a perfect voting system, but IRV makes a worse set of tradeoffs than STAR.",""

A friend of mine asked me if I had thought about getting an Xbox Series X/S, and while the thought had crossed my mind, I think I've been pretty settled on the opinion that owning an Xbox doesn't really serve any purpose anymore, and hasn't since at least the Xbox One era.    As far as I know, Xbox has no exclusives anymore that aren't also available on PC, and GamePass is available on both as well. Most if not all of the features on the XSX are matched or beaten out by the PS5, and for the price of an XSX you can buy a fairly capable PC as well (possibly for less if you buy a secondhand PC).    I don't understand why people continue to buy them anymore outside of brand loyalty or ignorance at this point.

"100","CMV: The #1 long term goal of humanity should be to expand sustainably","I think that the title of this post should be a **universal truth**. Please let me know why it shouldn't be.1. I assume that collectively, humanity as a species wishes to survive.2. Humanity can be likened to a parasite and our host is Earth\*3. It presently appears that our parasitic nature may cause ecological collapse that would in turn destroy ourselves.4. The only way we might survive this is to either: (a) build successful colonies off-planet; or (b) find ways to live sustainably on Earth, i.e. live in symbiosis with our host.5. Even if we achieve 4(a), failing to achieve 4(b) will mean that we will need to continuously jump planets.6. Thus, preferably we achieve 4(b) so that 4(a) is optional... barring non-human threats like the Sun burning out.7. Assuming 1-6 is true, we all really need to wake up to do whatever we can within our individual power to make 4(b) possible.8. Ideally 4(b) can be done with kindness and inclusion. Eg. EV cars made from forced labour cobalt mines are not ideal.Notes:* This is about humanity's #1 long term goal, not Country X, or John Doe individually. I'm sure the top goal of a starving person is to eat, not question whether the food is from sustainable sources.* This is a bloody idealistic post. I have no answers on how we may achieve it, and  I acknowledge that tradeoffs may need to happen against other goals of humanity. But I stand firm that this should be our **#1 long term goal.*** I include the words 'long term' as I recognize short term crises may arise (eg. covid) that steal attention from the long term. I feel though that short term crises never end. Like whack-a-mole, one will always pop-up after the other, so we really need to be managing short term crises **while simultaneously** progressing towards our #1 long term goal.* I have assumed that humanity deserves to exist and even expand, the validity of this could be discussed in a separate topic in itself.* I have made assumptions that things more or less stay the same until we achieve that goal. However, who knows, something more pressing to human survival may crop up in between, like a giant asteroid, or Skynet.* \*Sorry for the negative connotation of the word 'parasite'.

POC of girl is subservient to a white patriarch. White abusive love interests who she changes herself to appeal to rather than love herself. Her mother is gone and her father is a hispanic white passing male. This all perpetuates the white male patriarchs. 2. Asian women as one of the main casts and other POC of women. But lack of black and Asian men. Asian men are typically invisible in American white media, but blatantly so in this movie. Black men are typically portrayed as funny tropes similar to Asian men but zero to be seen. Except Sebastian who is played by Daveed Diggs. 3. Potential male romance role is once again a white male. While black, asian, and other POC of males are shafted. No black Eric. This could reinforce white patriarchy and white male worshipping while POC males are shafted, either played as joke roles or not at allMovie is very concerning now. May have to really reconsider my position and view. Hopefully the movie doesn't perpetuate white male worshipping and white patriarch. Shame disney.[ORIGINAL POST]Working with children in a very diverse area. It's nice to see better representation for children of color. Ariel is a good step in the right direction, it's not about us old timers anymore, it's about the children. Think about it like this, while it's nice to see white men in there 30s heavily concerned about the race of a mermaids in a children's movie. Growing up, it's always this:White man saves the day, is the hero, is the main character. White female is the princess, the main character, sometimes hero, center of attention, is the main character. But we hardly see much positive representation of people of color, only recently changes have been made, but with a lot of push back. Black men? Often times portrayed as male thugs, gangsters, needing a white savior, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Black women portrayed loud and obnoxious.Asian men? Weak, feminine, thugs, or smart but expendable resources, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Asian women are made to hate the Asian men and worship a white man, while hating and denouncing Asian heritage and culture.These things propagate into our real world through in a sense manipulation and have extremely negative consequences. So I'm happy for this movement for better representation. Is it perfect? Nope. But I'm optimistic and think our kids will have a bettee time with more relateable and positive role models through the media.",""

"104","CMV: No objective prescriptive statement or objective moral framework is supported by reality.","Status: minor change on all claimsI believe no objective moral framework exists, and only subjective meaning exists.Following the previous conclusion, I also believe objective prescriptive statements do not exist. By this, I mean any statement like: “if you want to have blue hair, you SHOULD dye your hair blue.” Although this statement is logical, I believe the objective “should” is never justified. This chain of logic obviously feels very unintuitive to me, but considering that I believe there is no objective meaning or actions that should be taken It seems only logical that prescriptive statements are always subjective.To this end, I will make several claims for two cases.If a god does not exist:1. An objective moral framework does not exist2. All meaning is subjective 3. All prescriptive staments are subjective 4. Good and evil is entirely subjectiveIf an all-knowing god exists:1. No noncircular explanation for an objective moral framework exists2. No non-circular explanation for the existence of meaning exists3.No non-circular explanation for the existence of objective prescriptive statements exists.4. No non-circular explanation for the existence of objective good or evil does not exist.Edit change: I am longer claiming any of these points with certainty, that I am claiming they are more likely to be the objective truth. You must now prove it is likely, rather than possible for me to be wrong.An example of a circular argument would be: an all-knowing god exists, it knows killing people is wrong, and therefore it is objectively immoral to kill people. You must prove how the conclusion can be reached by a method other than knowing it is true. *Additional standards I will hold myself to on CMV.*If a comment causes me to change anything about any claim I made, that will award a delta, but if I simply need to modify the logic used to reach my conclusions, my mind hasn’t been changed.If I have not replied to your comment and you have read through the entire thread and believe your argument to be sufficiently different and/or better than any other comment please repost it as a top level comment if it isn’t already and start the comment with (unique) and I will make sure to eventually get to it.

"105","CMV: Teachers persistently wearing gag breasts should be promptly removed from in-class duties","Teachers persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding through their shirt should be promptly removed from in-class duties.Such behaviour is a form of sexual harassment of children who are not free to leave the person doing this, and who are not free to complain about the behaviour without a risk of reprisal from an individual in a position of authority.Working in a workshop while wearing gag breasts poses a risk of an accident which may injure the teacher or possibly someone else. While some may not care if the teacher injured themself, part of OHS is forbidding workers from working in an unsafe manner.Persistently wearing gag breasts with nipples protruding is disrespectful to students and other teachers, and is disruptive to a school being a place of learning and personal development. It also promotes disrespect towards women when schools should promote respect for diverse groups of people. (If you’re female and you don’t feel offended, that’s fine, but that doesn’t mean others aren’t offended)If the teacher claims that the breasts are real, the teacher, possibly during paid work time and paid by the employer, should have a doctor certifying that the breasts are real.If the teacher is wearing gag breasts because of a mental issue which is not their fault, then they should be removed from in-class duties until their issue has resolved.If they can’t remove the teacher because of a teacher shortage or restrictions on disciplining teachers, fix the shortage or labour regulations.Schools should forbid inappropriate clothing for teachers and other staff, not just students.The school should not wait several months to act, or only act when international media gathered evidence that it was a charade. It should try to avoid punishing students for photographing the teacher - only doing so if it’s to prevent a lawsuit against the school or if the photography is disruptive or endorsing the teacher’s inappropriate behaviour.It should go without saying, but I’m using “they” because it’s about a hypothetical teacher who may be male or may be female, not because I’m asserting that the teacher is non-binary. And my view is about the school’s handling of the teacher, rather than about the teacher themself.Change my view.",""
"106","CMV: Financial incentives will not solve decreasing birth rates","A common reason I hear for decreasing birth rates is that people can no longer afford it due to increased cost of living. I disagree, I believe the main reason birth rates are decreasing is because people are simply not interested in having children.Many countries have tried providing financial incentives to increase birth rates, (China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Denmark, Finland, etc). All of their birth rates are projected to continue decreasing. Even countries with the most generous child care subsidies, like the Denmark and Luxembourg, have below replacement fertility rates. If even the Nordic countries, which subsidize child care, high quality public education, college expenses, and healthcare (reducing the financial burden of raising a child) cannot bring their fertility rates above replacement level, it suggests that financial incentives are not enough to meaningfully increase birth rates.I believe the biggest reason for the decrease in birth rates is because more and more people don't see children as necessary to having a meaningful life. It's no coincidence birth rates decrease as a country develops; more people (especially women) are able to be educated and find careers/afford pastimes that provide them a sense of fulfillment. This would explain why people with higher incomes/education have less children: there are more options to life.Societal values have shifted. Back when women were discouraged from pursuing higher education and professional careers, a lot of them followed societal expectations of ""women are supposed to be mothers."" Now that the societal pressure has decreased, it's only natural that less women choose to follow the traditional lifestyle that was once pushed onto them. We see women are having children at later age, and having less children overall.Children are a lot of work. Even if you paid me to be a parent, I wouldn't be interested, because it is a huge time commitment, it can be emotionally taxing, and can sometimes require sacrifices in our personal goals.There was an interesting observation made on Chinese social media. The post stated that for a long time, men never understood how difficult parenting can be, since they dumped all the heavy lifting of childrearing onto their wives. Now that women have more opportunities in life, the father has a greater role in childrearing, and many Chinese fathers are realizing it was much harder than they initially thought.After you finish your 9-5 job for the day, the second shift begins. Tantrums in the early years, worrying about your child's academic performance, making sure your child has good values and stays out of trouble, requires a lot of quality time. Considering all the implications parenting has on your career, the decrease in free time for yourself, the emotional toll of seeing your child go through hard times, I'm not surprised more people are choosing to embrace other lifestyles like DINK, being a Disney adult, or raising a pet.Unless societal values experience a DRASTIC change, or we enter some utopian post-scarcity society where people have too much free time on their hands, I believe fertility rates will remain below replacement level.",""

"108","CMV: The Federal government should not handle social issues","It seems I can't edit the title, but upon receiving feedback a better title for this post would be the following: The federal government should not pass legislation that only applies to a specific sub-group of people until majority of states have passed the legislation. &#x200B;I'm not taking any stance on any particular social issue for this argument, but it is my belief is that things would be much better and much less divided if the federal government handled only economic,  and defense issues, among others and not social ones (such as lgbtq+ issues and race based issues). This does not mean they should ignore discrimination against a particular class, but their role should stop at ensuring that the government treats all INDIVIDUALS equally, rather than trying to effect things like trans people in sports and rates of employment for particular classes of people, for example.I'll make two arguments for why I believe this:1. The Federal Gov can only do so much, and has it's hands full already without taking on complex issues of race and identity politics. We would have better outcomes in the non-social areas if the political discussion and elections at the national level avoided focusing on social issues.and2) Social Change happens much better and faster if it starts locally and then moves to state level, with any federal legislation being done only after the issue has been worked out at the more local levelsI will use gay marriage vs trans sports inclusion as examples:Imagine if in the 90s the congress had passed a law mandating states accept gay marriage. There was much less public support at the time, so this would have cause states to rebel and challenge this with state laws and supreme court challenges, and had it been forced through it likely would have led to a more conservative congress and president being elected in the following cycle, who would then overturn the legislation and possibly pass legislation banning gay marriage that would then be harder to overturn. The way it happened was a much better outcome than this (I am of the opinion that allowing gay marriage is absolutely the right thing to do, as treating gay people differently than straight people is unconstitutional and wrong, but this is just an example for the purpose of this post), and by waiting to pass federal legislation protecting gay marriage until after the public opinion was swayed, we got to a better outcome quicker with less chance of it being reversed.The trans rights issue is a counter example, where the Biden admin mandated that trans athletes be allowed to compete as the gender they identify within high school sports. (I am not taking a position on whether this is the right or wrong policy, it is a complex issue but it is beyond the scope of this post).We are now seeing backlash against this and other trans issues, and ultimately it seems the pushback is favoring the opposition in popular opinion.I believe that this approach will lead to a result that is counter to the result that those who believe it is the right thing would want, ie more backlash and more power going to politicians that oppose the rights that those in favor are pushing for.&#x200B;In summary, I think forcing social change at the federal level is counter-productive to the goals of said social change, and it also distracts the public, allowing special interests to essentially sneak by other legislation that very few want that hurts everyone (except the very few who want the legislation).&#x200B;Edit: It's been made clear that I need to define my position more clearly.I believe that the federal government should not deal with/debate issues that address a specific racial or social group until the majority of states have reached a consensus, they should only deal directly with issues that affect all individuals.For example, they shouldn't make a law or executive action that says ""people of X gender must be treated in such and such a way"" they should only pass laws or actions like ""ALL people must be treated in such and such way"". In the gay marriage example I used, the federal government passed legislation specifying rights for a specific group (gay people) only after the majority of states had passed the same legislation. I believe this is much preferable to the other way.",""
"109","CMV: there is no reason to assume animals can’t experience love like we can.","A question I keep asking myself is this: why do people act like every instance of animals showing affection can be explained away as different than ours?I’ve heard people say things like “dogs don’t really love you, they just love that you give them food.” And I guess I just don’t really understand because we could do the same with humans if we applied that logic consistently. “Oh, you don’t really love your family. You’re just conditioned to show them affection because they raised you and gave you food. You’re biologically wired to stick close to them because often times that would have given you a bigger chance for survival in the wild.”Why are people so determined to separate themselves from animals? Sure humans are different from a lot of other species in the world, but every species is unique. If the affection shown by animals isn’t indicative of love, then how can we say that the affection we feel and show is? I guess I should clarify I am not speaking about all animals here, but mostly about mammals who have an amygdala. If we’re willing to call our own biological feelings “love” then I don’t get why we can’t call that of animals the same.Edit: I’ve gotten some great responses here, thank you all. :) It’s true that I don’t think that all animals express their emotions in the same way that humans do. I guess I should clarify the reason that I think about this sort of thing is because I am concerned about animal cruelty and I have heard people justify hurting animals with the excuse that they don’t feel things like we do.Edit 2: I think I understand where the idea that animals experience emotions differently than us is coming from.

I'm also horrible with words, so I hope I'm able to have the intended meaning of my words come across properly.I don't think trans people are evil, that they should be punished or that they should have mean words thrown at them; this is not what this is about.For some reason, I get this visceral reaction when seeing that someone's trans online or irl; I just grimace internally and am like ""It's probably not a good idea to interact too deeply with this person."" While this isn't the case for other LGBT people or most leftists, it is the case with radical feminists or people you'd see at FDS. And for trans people. I've got a few trans/gender-fluid acquaintances, and sometimes it's like they're all the same person. I'm not sure if this is some actual pattern recognition or just confirmation bias, but I swear I can sometimes actually predict what their thoughts on random stuff like music will be. I don't think I've met a single transgender person that wasn't autistic or had some other sort of mental disorder either.This is all based on personal experience and I've got no studies to back my thoughts up other than that one time where I read somewhere that said transgender people are five times more likely to be on the spectrum. ...But there's a clear pattern here. I see conservatives sometimes make similar claims that there's a clear correlation between being transgender and having mental issues... but people just dismiss them as being lunatics, like they're intentionally trying to distort the original person's claim.I'm not saying they should be forced to detransition or whatever, nor do I think they're actual menaces to society or something, but just like it's \*weird\* to walk on all fours around the mall, it's \*weird\* to buy into all the rhetoric, partake into cancel culture, have pronouns in bio, all that stuff. Like, I get it: gender roles suck. I actually wish I were born a woman myself 'cause it'd affect how people treat me and shit. But I wasn't, I'm not, and I frankly think it's a bit, well, grimace-inducing to think you've become a woman or a man or some new sort of individual just because you decided to start/stop wearing makeup or dress like a 70-year-old grandpa. I once read a story about a happily married straight couple that was perfectly average until one of them realized she was a lesbian and the other one that she was a woman. And then they're happily married lesbians. ...And to me that makes no sense! Sexuality isn't a switch you can flip! People don't become hot just because they claim to be something different than you thought they were, now do they??Help me out please.

"111","CMV: The people of the United States have the right to refer to their country as ""America"" if they want.","(Disclaimer: I'm not from the United States of America, but I'm also not Latin American either.)I'm a huge believer in self-determination on scales as small as the individual and as large as nations. I generally think that groups of people should be allowed to determine who they are and how they want to show themselves to the world. Of course, we can never control other people's perception, but we can self identify and try to shape that perception. In recent years I've seen a lot of people (mostly on the internet) arguing that referring to the US as ""America"" is a misnomer because ""America"" refers to a continent (or two continents, depending on your worldview). I think this argument often comes from people living in Latin America, but there could be others, I'm not certain. I've seen some people argue this from a linguistics standpoint, like calling the US ""America"" is a grammatical error, and I've seen others make an anti-imperialist case, arguing that Americans (or United Statesians, maybe) are trying to assert themselves as the masters of the Western Hemisphere.I think policing language is often (though certainly not always) unproductive. It seems to me like this is a case of outsiders (people not from the US) trying to police how people inside the US describe themselves. I think that Americans should be allowed to call themselves whatever they feel. Beyond this, I think the linguistic argument just doesn't work. Most North American english speakers don't think of ""America"" as being a word for a single continent, they think of ""North America"" and ""South America"" (or maybe ""The Americas"").**EDIT:**The original post above is unchanged for transparency's sake, but I want to make a few follow up points:* I use the word ""right"" pretty melodramatically here. I'm a melodramatic person. I don't think this is a life and death issue. I'm not advocating for this to be enshrined in law or whatever, and I thought the body of the post was decently clear on that.* A lot of people are pointing out that ""US"" instead of ""America"" reduces confusion when speaking with non-Americans/non-English speakers, and I 100% agree. But the core of my question assumes no ambiguity; it's about the fundamental nature of the name of the country and its people.",""

Currently all they can do is speak. Freedom of speech and diversity of thought is one of the most important aspects of a functioning democracy. When people begin to physically assault others for their beliefs it is a sign of a movement towards authoritarianism.This is because violence towards people who have any differing opinions is only dependent on the common idea and can be turned in any direction if enough people agree. Ex. If I think that transgenderism is wrong and immoral and as dangerous as fascism and I have people that support me and we assault people who support transgenderism how are we any different than people who assault nazis?We’re not as it’s just about beliefs and if we decide to say it’s okay to assault people of x belief it opens up the door to assaulting people of any belief just because you disagree with them.

"120","CMV: Gary Lineker should publicly apologise or lose his role at the BBC","To give some background:- For those who don’t know, the BBC is the appointed national broadcaster, which role is to give British people impartial access to news.- Gary Lineker is an ex-England footballer and is currently a BBC Sport presenter- Gary Lineker has come out on Twitter actively criticising the government’s new Immigration policies on illegal immigrants (being denied asylum by default and permanently banned if they come to the UK illegally).- He went a bit far and compared the current policies to that of pre-war Nazi GermanyNow, I’m not saying I’m in support of the UK policies but I think it’s largely irrelevant. Taking a position with the BBC, employees are bound by that same impartiality. It’s a choice to work with the BBC, there are many other places Gary Lineker can choose to work and have public opinions…. but the impartiality of the BBC is brought (further) into question if it condones it’s employees actively opposing the government.I don’t think this is too far different from any employee causing instability for the company they’re working for. For example, let’s say I was known for working at company X advocating for legalising marijuana… that may reflect negatively upon the company and they would have a right to take reasonable actions. Like it or not, you’ve voluntarily entered a relationship with a company and are responsible for upholding their reputation or risking consequences. The main arguments I can see for a Gary Lineker are:- Freedom of Speech. I would argue he still has freedom of speech but, being paid as a celebrity, he doesn’t enjoy the same privacy and people know the organisations he represents. The BBC still have reasonable ground to take action against him and he’s still representing the BBC in some way, even if it’s just their hiring policy. - “The greater good”. He may be on the right side of a political debate and want to do good… but that’s what this is: A POLITICAL DEBATE which he’s precluded from engaging in as a BBC presenter. It also doesn’t mean he has complete immunity to the repercussions. That’s why people who take this stance are enshrined in history as they faced the consequences. - The BBC aren’t always impartial and have slipped up on a number of occasions. Although this is true, I don’t think there’s a lot of strength to say “well it’s not perfect. We may as well continue and sweep new instances under the rug”. If anything, I would argue this justifies an even stronger response to squash future claims.I wanted to hear others thoughts; maybe there’s another way around the issue or I’ve not considered an angle!

"122","CMV: Minorities should NOT be allowed to have institutions that only use their own language","Pretext: I am a Romanian citizen of Romanian-Hungarian descent and I live in Romania.I think it is detrimental to both minorities and the majority to allow minorities to have institutions that are exclusively or primarily using their native language.They should, however, be allowed to use it as a secondary language and to use it in any other private or public context.For a real life example, I will use public schools. Currently in Romania we have schools that explicitly teach only in Hungarian and we also have Hungarian sections in normal schools that only teach in Hungarian. I think they should be taught in Romanian, but they could have extra classes for Hungarian language, literature, history, etc. Reasons:1. Minority children that go to such schools often are completely or mostly illiterate in the majority language. Anecdotally, I can say that I know plenty of Hungarian kids(including relatives) that reach the age 18 without the ability to communicate in Romanian. This might mean that they fail their finals(which are at a national level, thus in Romanian) and that their opportunities are severely limited(in terms of education and employment)2. It contributes to cultural segregation and xenophobia. Again, this is anecdotal, but being part Hungarian myself and coming from a town with a high number of Hungarians, I've noticed Hungarians that are educated outside the Romanian system tend to be a lot more xenophobic and they also tend to be supporting separatist movements(they'd like the Ardeal region of Romania to join Hungary)Conclusion:Minorities should be forced to primarily use the majority language in public institutions in order to ensure they are integrated into society.Notes:1. I think they should be able and even encouraged to maintain their culture and language through other means. I don't have children yet, but when I do, I'd like for them to retain our Hungarian culture as well2. I've written this because I've heard plenty of Romanians complain and say that we shouldn't be helping Ukraine because they started forcing Romanians within Ukraine to have schools in Ukrainian, which they consider to be cultural genocide(I obviously disagree)Updates:1. I have decided that trying a softer approach by forcing Hungarian schools to at least teach their language and literature classes in Romanian primarily, rather than the whole curriculum, could be a better solution.",""

"126","CMV: Total Abolitionists who wish to eliminate the prison system do not truly believe that (California CDCR perspective)","**Introduction**Correctional Abolitionism is a rapid-growing ideology in today's society. Past social media and advocacy, the concept of abolitionism has entered law school forums and the legal curriculum itself. See from [Harvard](https://harvardcrcl.org/a-safe-and-flourishing-future-one-law-students-case-for-abolition/); [Columbia](https://cccct.law.columbia.edu/content/abolition-practicum); and [UCLA](https://law.ucla.edu/events/abolition-legal-field-discussion-about-abolitionism-classroom-and-beyond). (Note: These examples vary in approach; my argument will not be focused on these contents' paradigm.) As a personal anecdote, having attend various legal panels and seminars hosted on law school campuses, abolitionism seems to be more ""trending"" now more than ever.This is not to say there are not issues with the current criminal law system and certain laws. For example, Three Strikes law still exists in California. There are many good arguments against it. But that point also envelops the solution: the law is constantly changing, and its amenable nature makes it imperative to work within its system to progress change rather than deconstruct it entirely.I have had plenty of debate with abolitionists, from formal to informal settings, who have focused on various issues, i.e. racial disparities or the private prison complex, to justify total abolitionism. While these concerns have merit for discussion, these do not warrant the ""total abolitionist"" ideology. Instead, I see these abolitionists as highly opinionated and critical of the correctional system, but I do not believe any ""total abolitionist"" believes what they are claiming.The ""total abolitionist"" perspective I am arguing against: ""**Abolition rejects the expansion of** [**all aspects of the prison industrial complex**](http://correctionsproject.com/wordpress/portfolio/prison-maps/#jp-carousel-644)**.** **This means eliminating prisons and police as well as removing “policing” from society.** ""I do not believe any abolitionist truly believes in eliminating prisons, outside of it being a talking point. I am open to having my mind changed as I truly want to be convince of at least one reasonable argument. But I have yet to discover an argument consistent with viable solutions and incorporate enough nuance that merits any legitimate considerations. For my mind to be changed, I'd love all three premises to be reasonably challenged (in the context of California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.)**Context**I am aware of people having tough times and making difficult life decisions / mistakes, and the importance for rehabilitation. Thanks to the correctional system, they gain vocational skills, college educations, and much needed self-help trainings and programming (i.e. CALPIA) to re-enter society. Another underrated aspect is developing suitable parole plans: Once they get out, where will they stay? Do they have a support network? Will they have work to sustain themselves? Will they be in the best position possible to not revert to criminal behavior? These are all services that my State provides to the inmate. These are measures so a former criminal who committed lewd and lascivious acts against a child do not get tempted when they see a child on the street. Someone who murdered someone for rejecting him develops the self-control needed to not do it again.**Premises**I believe abolitionists, specifically in California, who are against the correctional system are very uneducated on the subject; in fact, I truly believe **they don't believe** what they are arguing. The main premises for my position:***1) Regarding total abolitionists - those who believe in fully abolishing the prison system - do not have viable nor practicable solutions for malicious crimes.***The premise explains itself. Someone murders twelve kids. How does an abolitionist suppose we deal with them?***2) The argument that criminal punishment should only focus on rehabilitation rather than be punitive unjustifiably undercut theories of retribution.***Why should your ""perfect world"" views take precedent over hurting victims and their families who want to feel relief and justice? If it was my wife badly beaten and assaulted, I would want them to receive punishment. You would the same if someone kidnapped, assaulted, and murdered your nephews and nieces. Why do your outside feelings take precedent over those directly impacted?***3) Our current system, and improving this system, is the best way to rehabilitate inmates.***It's hard to see **how or why** an abolitionist would disagree with CDCR's approach. Rehabilitating and reducing recidivism is exactly what states have been doing through proper programming. A total abolitionist view seems more argumentative than substantive.I'd include that in my State we are accommodating inmates more than than necessary -- in fact, we even allowed inmates to create their own podcasts distributed throughout prison radios. The State provides inmates commissary catalogues, allowing them to buy Nike shoes, watches, etc.**Conclusion**I think I made my points clear! Tl;dr total abolitionism / eliminating the prison system as a whole is more argumentative than substantive. It 1) does not provide practicable nor viable solutions for malicious crimes 2) rehabilitation > punishment does not fit the script for every crime and is unfair to victim families and 3) our current system and improving it is the best balance between punishment and rehabilitation and the best way to rehabilitate inmates already. Withstanding these three premises, it is impossible for someone to truly believe in total abolitionism.Edit #1Thank you for the thoughtful responses. I have a motion to prep so I will respond later.Edit #2It seems my post is not clear. Here is a revised title to help clarify my position: “People who believe in total abolitionism have no viable nor reasonable solution”.

If we can prevent something very bad from happening without sacrificing anything of moral significance we are obliged to do it. His example is, you see a child drowning and you can save him but it will ruin your clothes. The cost of your clothing would not be of moral significance so you are morally (not legally) obligated to jump in and save the child. We would probably view someone who didn’t as a bad person.2. Famine, preventable illness, death etc. are very bad things3. Organizations like unicef, against malaria foundation etc prevent the suffering described in premise 24.

"130","CMV: Using BCE and CE instead of BC and AD seems pointless to me.","I’m not a Christian so I don’t hold any religious value to BC and AD, but I personally don’t see the point in using BCE and CE in their place. They are for all intents and purposes the same calendar, and to me at least, BC and AD don’t hold a religious connotation anymore. They’re just the years to me. From my point of view, it seems a bit pointless to change the name of the calendar, when it retains the same root. CE and AD are the same thing in all but name. The common era still comes from the biblical date for Jesus’ birth because it is based off of the Christian calendar. Is the reason people use common era dates not because of a religious reason? I understand that AD stands for Anno Domini, Latin for the year of our Lord. Is this seen as too on the nose for some people who are either atheists or believe in another religion? I don’t think the majority of people know about the Latin meaning of AD, and I can’t see a reason why CE is preferable to AD when they hold the same meaning in practical terms. Again as much as I understand that BC and AD used to hold a religious connotation, I don’t think that is relevant to the modern world. Perhaps that same reason compels others to adopt the common era naming system, but again to me it seems a pointless gesture. At least to me, it has lost its religious meaning. It’s just the date system that we use. To me it’s like how “committing suicide” has lost its old meaning as a crime against god, it’s just what people say when referring to the action of taking your own life. It’s lost all religious meaning in the modern day, and I think BC and AD are the same, and therefore I can’t see a reason to change the dates I use.",""
"131","CMV: I don’t think most suggestions on gun control address the underlying issue & therefore I am against most suggestions that are offered.","Over 40,000 dead. Over half a 1,000 mass shootings.Something needs to be done and usually what I hear does not seek to rectify the underlying problem. Instead it would just make gun ownership more difficult for the vast majority of civil people who have a right to own one.I think most suggestions on gun control stem from two types of people.1) Those who are just ignorant about the situation and agree on what sounds good.2) Those who ultimately want to eliminate private gun ownership regardless of a constitutional right and know they need to take baby steps to slowly get rid of it. Here are some things that people usually get wrong when it comes to guns and why I don’t think suggested legislation doesn’t address the underlying problem.1. Suicide: A majority of gun deaths come from suicide. Trying to make it harder for people to get a tool to kill them selves does not address the underlying problem. People are still getting to that place where they wish for death instead of life. THAT is the problem. So even if you still have people living, what quality of life are they going through? I would like to point out that Japan has next to eliminated private gun ownership and they have a very high suicide rate. A firearm is not needed… again, that doesn’t address the problem.2. Mass shootings: Most people think mass shootings are a white male in a place with a lot of foot traffic. That’s incorrect. Most mass shootings are actually black on black violence. I’m sure people would never believe that due to the way the media really focuses on a certain type of mass shooting. Most mass shooting stem from a generational cycle of poverty & poor education. Lots of the time in those situations, these people are repeat offenders and or the firearm was procured by illegal means. Varies from place to place but upwards of 80% in some areas. 3. “Assault Weapons”: People who know the truth try to ban “assault weapons” first so they can eventually an handguns. People who don’t know think “assault weapons” are more dangerous and used in most mass shootings or shooting period. That’s absolutely not true. “Assault weapons” or AR15 variant rifles, AK variant rifles of rifles period are one of the LEAST used firearms in crime period. They are not the most used in suicides, murders or mass shootings. The percentage is tiny and I’ll leave it at that. Handguns are the most used for suicides, mass shootings and murder all together. So for those who know, they want to ban rifles first and then handguns because they know the numbers won’t change. 4. Loose gun control laws in other states: Some people think if the whole country followed NJ, NY or CA when it comes to gun control, the country would be better. First, those states have far too restrictive gun control measures. Second, those measures actually show it’s the people who are the issue, not the guns. Takes Texas for example. Texas usually has 2 or 3 of the safest cities in the country. Texas has “loose” gun control. But then certain parts of Houston are horrible. Look at California, some of the safest and richest towns there… then there is Compton. They all live under the rules of their individual states but the outcome is different in certain areas, why is that? I assure you if you look up median income, percent of people who have a college education, two parent homes and high school graduation rates of the different areas… they would be quite different. Points to what is the underlying cause… poverty and education. So in short, I believe poverty, mental health & abysmal education are the underlying issues for a majority of death when involving a firearm. I don’t see how most legislation looks to address those problems. Most of the time it’s trying to treat the cough and not the lung cancer. So can someone give me a federal law or proposed bill that would actually address the root cause of most gun violence and simply not make it more difficult for most good people to purchase a gun?",""
"132","CMV: As a Gun Control Method, Banning ""Assault Weapons"" Makes Little Sense","Let me begin by stating that I am in favor of most gun control policy ideas, at least the more mainstream ones (i.e., better background checks, registration, and banning guns that are more dangerous). However, many pro gun-control groups are pushing for another ""Assault Weapon"" ban, just like the one we used to have 20 years ago. In the 1994, there was a federal bill passed, and then sunsetted, that banned ""Assault Weapons,"" which included AR-15 style rifles, and most groups pushing for assault weapon bans seem to want to import the definition from this bill.The bill in question banned the following rifles:*Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and has two or more of the following:** *Folding or telescoping stock** *Pistol grip** *Bayonet mount** *Flash hider** *Grenade launcher*The bill also banned some other forms of ""assault weapons,"" however this is the part of the bill that would apply to AR-15s. &#x200B;My problem is not with people saying that AR-15s should be banned, my problem is fact that this bill made no sense. On one hand, this definition allows to much. According to the bill, a gun can have a detachable magazine and a grenade launcher, but still not be considered an ""Assault Weapon."" I for one think that any gun with a grenade launcher is more dangerous than need be, regardless of if it has a pistol grip. On that note, this bill's definition also banned things that really have no bearing on how dangerous a gun is. For instance, why should a pistol grip matter? Or, why should a telescoping stock matter? I fail to see how adding a pistol grip to a gun makes it anymore dangerous. Basically, my problem with banning ""assault weapons"" is that it really doesn't change anything. Very dangerous guns are still able to slip through gaping loopholes and the guns that it does ban are not really any more dangerous than the ones that it does not. Also, conservative groups have pointed these facts out. While I tend to disagree with the NRA, they are very much correct when they say that a Semi-automatic gun with a pistol grip cannot do any more damages than one that has a traditional handle.  For these reasons, I don't think that pro gun control groups should be pushing for another assault weapons ban. Or, at the very least, they should not be pushing for the same definition. Instead, they should focus on things that actually make guns more dangerous. For instance, a better definition would ban all guns with grenade launchers, but allow cosmetic changes, like pistol grips.  Change my view.",""
"133","CMV:Contemporary mainstream Films lack a central creative vision because too many people are involved in making them","If anyone has heard of the  parable of the blind men and an elephant it is a story of a group of blind men who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and imagine what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective knowledge.So. How does this apply to filmmaking? Well. For starters they're increasingly not written by a person, but a committee. There are also notoriously a number of boxes to check. And each person is looking at a very specific aspect of the story that they think is the most important. While ignoring an overreaching central vision. Since films are consumed by one person, these disparate views create films which are flat and predictable.Another contributing factor is that filmmaking has become more democratic. A Kubrick film looked like a Kubrick film. A Tarantino movie the same. Now a James Cameron film just looks like... What? To me its just pandering to the lowest common denominator and you can no longer see the hand of the director in the work. Now. There are exceptions of course. Todd Phillips Joker would be one of them. But, it's also worth noting this was a low budget film. Costing around 55 million to make. But grossing over a billion. Why? I'd say a large part is due to the fact that Phillips vision shaped the film into something of his own and audiences crave that. However taking a risk on a small budget film like this isn't a sure thing for investors, so they're more likely to just put their money on avengers and be assured they can get it back.",""
"134","CMV: The cliche of marriage being expensive is flat out wrong considering the value of combining resources","It's been a common trope that marriage is expensive. jokes have been made about it on sitcoms, in cartoons, stand up comedy routines etc but that legitimately couldn't be further from the truth.For nearly everyone the main expense they have is housing, for most people it consumes between 20 and 50% of their income. This really cannot be changed, especially in major cities where there is a very real lower limit to how much rooms, apartments, and houses cost, even in ""undesirable"" areas.[Americans are increasingly burdened by rent](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2018/04/american-families-face-a-growing-rent-burden) and with skyrocketing housing costs for many it's the only way they can get housing.But marriage, or a significant other you live with, is a big help to this on an individual level. Each partner cuts their rent expenses in half once they move in with each other, many stop needing roommates entirely because 2 people can live in a studio or one bedroom apartment. There are people who are able to live with multiple people in one bedroom apartments using bed sheets as walls, however, this is illegal in many jurisdictions due to zoning restrictions. With (roughly) twice the income, and twice the necessities, married couples often can better utilize buying in bulk, without worrying about food going bad prematurely, or that 18 pack of paper towels being enough to overdraw your bank account. This brings the cost per unit of necessities like groceries down as well. Buying in bulk has such a drastic effect on people's finances that it's been cited as a factor that [keeps poor families poor](https://www.wpr.org/study-low-income-households-miss-out-savings-because-they-cant-afford-buy-bulk)I cannot think of anything that gets *more* expensive per person when one gets married, due to the simple fact that combining resources is so effective at reducing costs.",""

If your hands literally cannot come into contact with water (very rare), why not use some alternative? There are vulnerable people out there, and handwashing has been proven to protect them. And unlike wearing a mask, washing your hands doesn't impede your day-to-day life. So, people who do not wash your hands, why? Is it just laziness, or is there something else going on?

"137","CMV: It’s not wrong to glorify historical people despite their immoral deeds.","Is it wrong to admire past great men just because their actions were violent or disliked by others in modern times? My view is no it’s not wrong, I do it to some of my favorite historical figures. But I’ve heard people say this reflects badly on who I am.Here’s some context. I recently got into an argument that often happens when praising historically great men. Being a fan of Hannibal Barca (the Carthaginian general), I retroactively admire his war against Rome. And in particular I said I was somewhat happy and felt it justified that Rome was eventually destroyed (pillaged) hundreds of years later as retribution for Hannibal’s loss. However, someone responded saying that it was wrong to praise the violence incurred on a city just b/c of my admiration for a once enemy of that city.In another example, I once made a post about Julius Caesar, praising him as a great polymath (which he was) and significant person. But people, admittedly truthfully, pointed out his brutal violence against innocent people, his sexual deviance, etc… and that he is not worthy of praise. And so praising figures that one would obviously not want to emulate today is a wrong thing to do.I can’t argue that these past figures didn’t do bad things, but I still admire and glorify these  individuals regardless. Does that mean I’m wrong and this reflects badly on my character (and anyone who does a similar thing)? I don’t think so, but I want to get to the bottom of this.",""
"138","CMV: We should be electing two governments, one for social issues and one for economics","As the title says, I believe that if we divided governments into two parts, it would be beneficial for everyone of us.My main reasons for believing this is:- We could separate our economic, social and political (For political I mean things like foreign politics) beliefs, so that someone who is, for example, socially conservative and more left leaning economically doesn't have to decide whether he values more his social or economical beliefs.- As I said, we wouldn't have to trade our social or economic beliefs for their counterpart: this way, we don't risk being stuck with economic or social politics we don't like just because in that moment we value more the other one (I see this all the time: some people dislike most right-leaning social beliefs, but much prefer their economics).- In my idea, there could not be any crossover between economic and social parties: this would make parties less divided and much more focused on their objectives, without the need to balance social politics and economics. Parties would also need to cater to a smaller audience, so that their beliefs would be a little less nuanced and less diluted.Obviously, I recognize how some issues may arise from this:- Some economic and political doctrines are somewhat incompatible with each other, making it harder for the two parts of the government to cooperate- There isn't a hard divide between economics and social politics: they are extremely connected, to that also makes it harder for the two parts to cooperate. Defining what is the field of the economic government and what is the field of the social government could also be difficult.However, I'd expect that it would be hard for completely opposite social and economic doctrines to find themselves in the government, as social beliefs are connected with economic beliefs and vice versa, so that I wouldn't expect, for example, to find democratic socialists and hardline conservatives together in the government. I'd also put an executive political figure that would try to unite the two parts and help them cooperate and harmonize their different beliefs (It could be an elected president or, as I would prefer, a monarch, or anything else.)Why CMV: As much as I am interested in politics, I am no expert, so there is likely something serious I'm missing that would make this system crumble completely.",""

"143","CMV:National Patriotism is illogical. No one should be proud of their country.","Patriotism is completely illogical. I will mostly be talking about patriotism in regard to the United States because I am from here, but I think there is no sense of being patriotic regardless of where you are from.First, no one chooses where they are born. Why would you be proud of this genetic lottery? You wouldn't be proud of being born in a certain hospital building right? ""Fuck yeah, I was born at John Hopkins!"". You’d be laughed at if you said that because it’s illogical and strange.Second, most first-world countries have a history of conflict and war crimes. In America, there existed centuries of slavery, genocide against Native Americans, segregation, lynchings, etc. Obviously, no one who is alive today participated in those things. But these were policies perpetuated by our government and under our constitution (the very same constitution we are currently operating under). No one should feel shame for those act since no one alive today carried out those acts (except for segregation as people from that era are still alive). But we wouldn't feel pride either right?Oftentimes you will hear conservatives say that we shouldn’t feel shame about slavery because it was in the past. So if we shouldn’t feel shame about our past mistakes, we shouldn’t feel pride for our past accomplishment either right? And even if you did contribute to those things indirectly (taxation funding NASA), it's not like you CHOSE for your money to go to the funding of space exploration. Your money went there because our (largely-undemocratic) government said it should go there.What about the good things ""we've"" done. Moon landing, spreading democracy (very arguable), stopped fascism in Europe. No one alive did any of those things (unless you are a WWII veteran). ""We"" didn't land on the moon. Engineers and astronauts worked for that to happen. They are entitled to feel pride because they accomplished that. Why should the rest of the country feel proud? I was born 30 years after that happened. Why should I feel proud about that? I didn't contribute to any of those things.Being proud of personal accomplishments is perfectly logical, but being proud of something simply because someone in your country did that? It makes no sense. Let's say I lived in an apartment complex called ""Oak Forest Apartments"". Then I hit up my city hall records office and found out that 20 years ago, a gold medal olympian lived in my exact apartment. Would it make sense for me to say “Oak Forest fuck yeah! Oak Forest pride! Oak Forest pride! All Oak Forest Apartment residents are Olympians”. I would be ridiculed if I did that. How is national patriotism different?

Reddit is at fault for this too. The entire upvote and downvote system is completely unnecessary and heavily influences what people say or don't feel safe enough to say. Not to mention is creates a crowd where one crowd jumps on a sole individual who simply states a factual statement. I'll most commonly use posts seeking advice as an example. More often than one person gives advice based on factual info and data. While you get a crowd who prioritizes their feelings or the social media trend they were taught. Very easily over downvotes it creates motivation for others who just joined on the topic to jump on the only factual person in the comment section.

You give someone 1,5k upvotes on a comment based on feelings now they can never take a step back and accept they're wrong. Now the pressure is on them to hold onto that online team for another dopamine rush of people taking their side. It creates a false sense of pride. Studies have shown that even 1 like on social media can cause a rush of dopamine.

"151","CMV: we should no longer be considered the same type of human that existed before smartphones","Change my view! I’ve been struggling with this for a while now. I can’t think of a single thing that we do that’s similar to how our grandparents experienced life. Things have changed on a fundamental level. Considering that evolution likely happens primarily due to external pressures in the environment, if we continue with this way of life, humans will surely turn into something else entirely. And that’s only if we haven’t already changed, given that a particular type of environment must have caused smartphones to emerge, which means we have likely already deviated  from humans that existed before smartphones, let alone humans that existed outside of civilization/specialization/domestication. Given that social norms, order, functionality, and mating rituals all revolve around intense and complex algorithms, modern human beings should no longer be considered the same as our ancestors. Even if we are genetically the same or similar, which we aren’t, due to proliferated diseases/illnesses, and disorders in the gene pool, our environment has changed so dramatically that I struggle to see how we are similar in any meaningful way.",""

It gets so stupid in some countries that an immigrant family's childrend can't get citizenship, even if they were born in that country.In conclusion, this is how it should work: If you lived in a country for a certain amount of time (different for each country depending on circumstances), pay taxes there, and speak their language, you can attempt the citizenship test.&#x200B;cmv.",""
"154","CMV: Schools should pay you for good grades","A little prelude to how I remember my school life in my country (Germany):1. Oral participation was just as important as tests/exams. Meaning, 50% of your grade was determined by your participation in class, inlcuding answering teacher's questions, presenting your homework, volunteering for tasks...2. We had quarter-yearly reports on our grades within a single school year, which we could use as a standard for payouts.The most obvious benefit is that students will pay more attention in class to get their financial compensation. A lot of young children don't even get allowance from their parents, most teenagers all the way to high schools don't work any jobs.Another, albeit less obvious benefit is that we're teaching students how to be financially responsible at a young age. This ties in to the second sentence of my previous point.I can give an example model of how this could look like:1. Students, when enrolled to middle school, are taught about the model, rewards, and the such, so that they're motivated right as they get in.2. Both oral participation and tests flow in equal measures towards your grade.3. At the end of a quarter, schools write a quarterly report and immediately hand out money associated with the grade. The conversion from grade to money is explicitly shown.4. Example, C -> $1, B -> $5, A -> $10, A+ -> $20. These numbers can or should probably be adjusted from school to school, depending on local climate and how well it is receieved.The grades aren't attached to a specific grade of a test or anything, it's the combination of both oral participation and written tests that build up to your final grade on your school year certificate.There are some ideas here that I'm not entierly married to. We can probably adjust the rate at which payouts are given, and the exact amounts in $ can be quibbled over.**Edit:** After reading some of your comments, it appears my perception is biased towards German school systems. For those of you saying that ""only the smart kids from advantaged backgrounds are going to get good grades"", we have different types of school forms that students are sorted in after elementary school.  This way, students of all ""groups"" are segregated in a way so that they can still get good grades.The introductory paragraph of this Wikipedia article sums it up nicely.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptschule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptschule)",""

"156","CMV: when looking at the current state of the African Americans in the US you can’t deny the existence of systemic racism without imply drastic inherent inferiority of African Americans.","In this I’m going to begin with the term African American but then switch to black. Just to clarify I’m talking about black descendants of slaves brought to what was or what would become the US.What I mean by my title is that when someone says systemic racism doesn’t exist or that refuse to attribute the vast majority of the reasoning behind the current state of African Americans to systemic racism, you are, either intentionally or inadvertently implying that African Americans are inherently inferior.So hear me out, when looking at the how the black community developed overtime there’s it really any way that you can separate it from the 450 years of state sanctioned oppression and even more of social exclusion. You can very clearly see these effects when looking at overall statistics on poverty, crime, imprisonment, police deaths, etc.  None of that can really be looked at without the context of racism.When you take away the oppression seen and look at purely the statistics and not the history of why things are the way they are there’s only one real conclusion. Black people are in the state they are in because of culture and inherent characteristics that push them to act this way. For example let’s take poverty. In the US, there is a very clear gap between white families income and black families income. White families make roughly a 33% more on average than black people. About 1/5 of black people live below the poverty line when 8% for white people. So the explanation absent of the racial issues is that black people simply aren’t qualified or attempting to get higher paying jobs. Sure at face value, doesn’t seem crazy but if you press that, ask why black people less qualified while still refusing to attribute anything to systemic racism, you land at saying that they are underqualified because their culture prevents them from pursuing a good career as it does white people.This game can be played with every major problem in the black community today. People who deny systemic racism call it refusing to take personal accountability, but I think it’s more understanding history and how it affects people today.",""
"157","CMV: Jews have no legitimate claim to the land of modern day Israel. A two-state solution is already a major concession made by the Palestinians.","After reading about the Israel-Palestine conflict, I was shocked at how rarely people point out the flawed logic behind pro-Israel arguments. I do not believe Jews have a meaningful claim to the land of Israel, and a ""Jewish state"" should have never been established in the region. I will be debunking common arguments for a Jewish state of Israel below, and will gladly respond to any others that are brought up to this post.1) The Jews deserve a homeland because centuries of history have shown their safety is never guaranteed in non-Jewish countries.I agree, Jews have every right to establish their own country so they do not have to worry about being a persecuted minority. However, Jews do not have a right to establish a Jewish state over a region that is already inhabited by non-Jewish people. If the principal concern is establishing a country where Jews can be safe, why does it have to be established in a region that is majority Muslim? There are other regions of the world with unoccupied land, but Jews insist their nation be established over the historic land of Israel. In this case, the ""Jews just want a homeland"" is a red herring to avoid the issue of a Jewish state being established over a region occupied by Arabs for centuries.2) Jews legally bought land in Palestine in the 19th and 20th centuries.Yes, Jews legally bought land during both the Ottoman and British administration of the region. However, these were regarding private ownership of the land, which is different from sovereignty of the land. Many Chinese people buy real estate in Vancouver, but it does not mean Chinese people buy the sovereignty of Vancouver. The land is still legally the territory of Canada, Chinese people cannot establish a ""Chinese state"" because they bought real estate in Vancouver. Therefore, Jews legally buying land in Palestine does not mean it gives them the right to establish a Jewish state on that land.3) Jews earned the right to establish a Jewish state in Israel after it negotiated the Balfour Declaration from Britain.This was a colonial era document. If you think colonial territory agreements should be maintained, then you are against the independence of Korea, Vietnam, India, etc. The British should have never made such promises on the first place, especially considering they made overlapping promises to the Arabs in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence. A similar argument is that Jews earned the land after winning a war instigated by an Arab coalition. This is right by conquest, which has no longer been recognized by international law since the resolution of WW2. 4) Jews made better use of their land than the original Ottoman/Arab landowners. ""Israelis like to build, Arabs like to bomb and..."" Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, where gay people can have their relationship legally recognized.People bring up these points because they believe Israelis have made ""better use"" of the land than their Palestinian Arabs counterparts, therefore Jews deserve the land. This is not how sovereignty works. Imperial Japan was famous for using this argument to justify the annexing/colonization of Okinawa/Taiwan/Manchuria/Korea/etc. This was almost universally condemned, and Imperial Japan is nothing more than two mushroom clouds over the ash heap of history. Even if Japan made greater crop yields/repealed some antiquated practices/provided industrial living conditions to these colonies, doesn't change the fact they were occupying land and people against their will.5) Arabs live much more peaceful and prosperous lives in Israel, compared to life in Palestine. Israel grants equal rights to it's Arab citizens, many of which are part of the Israeli government.Just because you give equal rights to Palestinian Arabs doesn't mean you are entitled to their land. By this logic, US can annex even more of Mexico, so long as it offers the Mexicans in the region full US citizenship. It also doesn't solve the issue that the Arabs cannot truly be equals when a Jewish state occupies a majority Muslim region. If you believe in truly equality, you would not need to enshrine Israel as a ""Jewish state,"" this is just to hedge against the fact the region of Palestine is majority Arab Muslims.6) Jews were the original inhabitants of the region, Jews have maintained a continuous presence in the region of Israel throughout history.Regardless of who the original inhabitants of the region were, the majority of the region has been inhabited by Arab Muslims for the past few centuries. If you believe being the original inhabitants entitles you to the land forever, does that mean the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand have to return the land to the indigenous population? These indigenous groups were displaced within the past 5 centuries, with some regions still being majority indigenous until the past 2 centuries, whereas Jews did not administer the region for over a millennium. I understand this is a very serious part of your identity, with the name ""Palestine"" already being a huge scar in your ethnic history, but we cannot undo these tragic events in your history. America is named after an Italian explorer, our capital is named after a colonizer and a slaveowner. The Jews are not the only ones who have historical trauma.7) There was no such thing as a ""Palestinian"" identity until recently, they were just Arabs. Arabs have 22 countries, why can't they accept there being one Jewish state?Most serious people are not saying there cannot be a Jewish state. They are merely arguing that you cannot establish a Jewish state over land that is already inhabited by Arabs. Just because Arabs have a lot of land, doesn't mean you are entitled to some of their land. By this logic, Korea is entitled to some of China's land, Bangladesh is entitled to some of India's land, and Mongolia is entitled to some of Russia's land. It doesn't matter whether the Arabs considered themselves distinctly Palestinian, they are not Jewish and do not want to be under a Jewish state.8) Israel has always been willing to give concessions for peace, but the Palestinians always reject peace treaties.From the very start, these peace proposals have been favored towards Israel. The 1947 borders gave the Jewish minority sovereignty over the majority of land in the region. Other sore spots include Israel wanting sovereignty over East Jerusalem, and Israel wanting their borders to encompass areas with arable land and water sources. A two state solution is already a large concession for the Palestinans to make, Israel should offer more concessions.9) Israel wants peace, but the Palestinians choose terrorism. Israel has no choice but to make ""hard decisions"" for its own security. The Arab League/Muslim Brotherhood/Iran all want us blown off the map.Palestinians had no interest in being under a Jewish state, yet it was imposed against their will. It is not unlike the Macabbeans, who revolted against their Seleucid occupiers. You can't occupy/displace people and then be shocked when they fight back. Israel is not a perfect victim, it exacerbated the problem when it bankrolled extremists groups in Palestine in order to destabilize the opposition. While I acknowledge Israel has legitimate security concerns from hostile neighbors, what did you expect when you displaced Muslims to establish a Jewish state in a region dominated by Muslims?Ideally, the region of Palestine should have been one state, where the rights of the Jewish minority would be enshrined in its constitution. Ultimately, I recognize that Israel has existed for almost 75 years, and at this point the one-state solution is no longer viable. Most of the world has made the right steps in accepting Israel as a member of the world. I wrote this post because I wanted to point out that the framework of the two state solution should have never been used in the first place, and the two state solution is the consequence of the UN's failure to objectively solve the problem in 1947.",""
"158","CMV: ALL the Yakuza games have bad combat","I've been exploring subreddits, videos, reviews of the Yakuza franchise and one thing I see people praise is the combat (except 3 because of enemies stunlocking the player). But I'm sorry, the world building, story, characters, environment, side stories are all great but I just can not get behind the idea that the combat is greatReason 1: No TelegraphLet's take Dark Souls for example now I know you are already gonna go ""their different games stop comparing!"". I think the Dark Souls (for the most part) perfected fair combat and I want to use it as an example so stop complaining and listen. Usually when you die in Dark Souls, it's your fault not the ai. That's what is so appealing about dark souls is because you actually learn to evade enemies, attack at the right time, use strategy to win. In Yakuza, bosses give like 3 frames MAX per attack basically guaranteeing damage and when you attack back they can dodge, block, counter with ease. To me, as someone who doesn't use Adderall, monster energy and rise pre workout to play a fighting game, can't see that bullshit and people will always respond with skill issue even to someone who has 700+ hours across the whole series because they refuse to think a game that hasn't changed it's combat system since the PS2 version is outdatedReason 2: I don't care if you hit me with a chainsaw, I have I Frames while standing completely stillIn dark souls, enemies get I Frames just like you and both you and the bosses have a fair amount of I Frames. Usually most bosses get I Frames during critical hits or dodges and since they have limited stamina, they can only dodge so much just like you. In Yakuza however, some of the main story bosses and any side story bosses will break that fairness in half over it's knee. The enemies can freely block all the damn time with forearms of steel but when you try and block it's broken in 3 light attacks and your dead. They will get I Frames from standing still and when you are out of punching reach the enemy magnet towards you and guarantee a hit. I'm sorry, but if you have guaranteed hits in your game, that's bad game design and artificial difficulty.Reason 3: The only way to win is CheeseOnce you have given up and become mentally exhausted, you probably found a way to cheese the fight using heat actions (especially bad in Yakuza Kiwami 2). Now yes Dark Souls did have cheese, but most of the time the bosses you fight really have to push you over the line before you make that choice and sometimes getting the cheesy weapon is sometimes even harder than the boss itself. But in Yakuza, it's just XXY, Heat Action, Repeat but if the enemy has bullshit I Frames, just pull out a weapon and repeatedly use Heat Actions and Stamina Royal to win. That's not even taking to account fucking tiger drop. I'm sorry but if the combat is made to be cheesed, that's bad game designI love Yakuza but holy shit is the combat exhausting and makes me want to quit the series. I'm trying really hard to find what's so great about it that people praise it but the only thing I see is the over the top heat actions you will see 500+ times over the series because SEGA reuse so many assets you'd be convinced their running a money laundering scheme.If someone could please help me understand, I am willing to listen but holy shit is this bad",""
"159","CMV: Christianity as an ""organized religion"" is fundamentally flawed, cultish, fake, and full of liars","The idea of Christianity as ""organized religion"" sees it is, by definition, cultist. The word *cult* has a negative connotation, but by it's black-and-white definition, it falls into that category: *n. a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.* Anyone who associates with organized religion or ""the church"" falls under this category, regardless of which definition they decide to worship or which denomination they fall under.I do believe in a ""god""--but the existence of such cannot be proven nor disproven. It is entirely unknowable, by my beliefs, and to ""prove"" God exists (Christianity's God, here, as that's the subject matter) would invalidate Christianity, as one of the basis for the entire religion is that God *cannot* be proven, and thusly requires blind faith to follow. The ""what if it was proven that God exists"" argument is one of the main reasons I left the church; the argument itself is self-destructive and paradoxical.The Bible physically cannot prove the existence of God. All we know is that it's a collection of religious writings that has, shockingly, been able to evolve and adapt with the evolution of mankind. But mankind still wrote it. Take the Flood: we have scientific evidence that the Flood occurred. We have historical evidence and texts. But we also have *other* religions claiming the Flood happened, and it was also caused by their God. So it alone cannot prove the existence of God. Nor can the ""Pontius Pilate"" stone. Okay, so Pontius Pilate existed. That still does not prove the existence of God.More people use the name of Christianity to justify horrible acts than those who use it to facilitate good acts. Two examples: all of the LGBT+ hate, and obfuscated racism (Jesus constantly depicted as white and refined when he was a Middle Eastern carpenter, as an example). On a more surface level, take anyone who drives a car with the symbol of their church on it. In my experience, those people are some of the worst drivers and road ragers I've ever seen. I'm a full-time delivery driver; I see a lot of them.The Bible is more a wholistic guide on how to be good and treat others with kindness, in my opinion. Perhaps it was spoken to us from a higher being, or perhaps mankind wrote it themselves with a guide to ""be better"".What kind of God threatens eternal agony and punishment for those who don't love him? That's not love, that's forced subservience. ""Love me, *or else.*"" And if ""hell"" is simply separation from God...well that doesn't seem to be too bad, now does it? Will I look up to ""heaven"" and feel jealous? Maybe. But if I get punished for trying to be a good person and constantly improve myself, and simply not believing in a deity, that's not a God I want to worship.I'm an agnostic theist.

High fashions and haute couture shows should be relatable and make everybody feel better about themselves.

There should be different body types. There should be a variety of plus size models, dwarf models, handicapped models etc. The typical model look is so uniform and it's boring to have everybody look the same. It would be so much better if designers made clothes for different types of the individuals, not just the very typical Barbie look with the same proportions. Why can't curvy women walk the runway, what's wrong with a bit of fat rolls, big thighs etc? The designers should represent that better!

My parents are from Mainland China and I have some relatives there. I’ve visited China several times and I enjoyed it a lot. It’s a great way for me to learn about my “home” culture, history, language, and people, and forging vital connections to my roots and identity.I’ve never been to Taiwan, but I don’t see why I should go there instead of China. Taiwan simply doesn’t seem to have much to offer that China doesn’t have already - or even better things. Why go to the Taipei 101 when the Shanghai Tower or the Shenzhen Ping’an Financial Center are taller? What’s the appeal in Sun Moon Lake when Jiuzhaigou is much more scenic and colorful? And isn’t most of “Taiwanese cuisine” just ripped off of Fujian’s and Guangdong’s? China has more culture, more history, more development, more opportunities, and more relevance than Taiwan. Taiwan is just a minor offshoot of Chinese civilization that has been influenced by foreign powers like Japan and the US.Now, I do admit, I’ve heard defensive apologetic arguments from certain Taiwanese, saying that “Come to Taiwan because Taiwan is where all the *real* Chinese culture survives and thrives, since we didn’t have Communism or a Cultural Revolution etc., and overall everything’s more free.” And I have to ask, don’t these arguments honestly sound more politically motivated than anything? Culture evolves over time and varies widely across different regions, and is not set in stone. In fact, right now, especially when talking about the younger generations, Mainlanders are more patriotic and conscious of their culture and history than their Taiwanese counterparts.As for the censorship issue and so on, it’s honestly overblown, and as long as you don’t get too involved in the local politics or directly insult the government, tourists should be fine. And yes, the Internet is fairly highly restricted, and not everybody might want to use WeChat or Baidu, but even so… You're going there to experience the real China and its rich and diverse culture, not to surf the web all day. You can use local sources or talk to people directly. And for all the horror stories people tend to highlight about controversial acts the Mao and the Communists might have done in the PRC, it’s definitely worth mentioning that Chiang and ROC aren’t exactly squeaky-clean either. Yellow River Flood, 228 Incident, White Terror… Deng Xiaoping started opening up in the 1970s, while Taiwan remained under martial law all the way until 1987.But I digress (and this shouldn’t be a political debate and I don’t want it to turn into one). To be clear, I don’t mean to sound like I’ve anything specifically against anyone from Taiwan or who likes Taiwan. It’s a nice place with nice people. It doesn’t “suck”, and I’m skeptical of the Mainlanders who say stuff like “Taiwanese people are nasty towards Mainlanders, especially southern Taiwanese”. But considering I’m an Overseas Chinese with plenty of heritage from one China and none from the other, I don’t see any compelling reason to visit the other China instead of, you know, China.So, what do you think?

Maybe but I keep on postponing it cause it just straight up doesn’t sound like a good time. My theory is that a lot of people feel this way too. Back when we had NO CHOICE whatsoever and no options, sure people had 5 children because what else was there to do? We were socialized into it and believed it was our only choice. But now that people know they can have a fulfilling career and make good money and travel and live stress free, suddenly raising children isn’t as attractive a lifestyle option.So imho governments can hand out as many financial incentives as they want- unless it’s a stupid amount of money (say an extra $100k per year per child) it won’t move the needle.

"169","CMV: John Wick is kind of a selfish asshole","Spoilers for John Wick movies, obviously. Also, I'm analysing this from the perspective of the movie's universe own rules and events, not movie rules, so ""if he didn't do it there would be no movie"" won't change my view.Maybe I'm missing something (it's been a while since I watched the movies), but it seems like at this point Wick is just messing up with a, uh, perfectly organised network of assassins and crime syndicates because of his personal vendetta. His actions have just become increasingly unjustified with each movie, compared with the first movie.Yes, Santino was an asshole in the second movie, but not for requesting Wick's help, but for asking for the murder of his own sister. I don't remember if Santino immediately tells John of his intentions and it's because of that that he refuses, but the fact is, a marker is a marker. And that is further established when John himself makes use of a marker to force Sofia to help him, so we can't really hold Santino back for that (there's the fact that John could instead just killed Santino instead from the get-go, buuut this is not about plot consistency).Also, if I remember it right, Wick wasn't banished for killing Gianna, and it was just Santino ""avenging his sister"" and not the High Table going after him. He was only truly banished and made a public enemy when breaking the rules of the Continental, something he could've perfectly avoided.And then, the High Table is posed as the ""big bad guy"" in the third movie, but we haven't seen anything that really make them look bad. It's a world of criminals and assassins, after all, and they haven't show us anything that make them out to be any worse than all the rest. They are just the overseers of the system, which seems to be working just fine. The Bowery King mentions the ""corruption"" of the High Table iirc, but what corruption? He's just another guy with a lot of power that doesn't seem to like to submit to others, and for the entire third movie they are just following their own rules and Wick and his friends keep bending and breaking.Granted, I do think that the array of overlapped systems create confusion and loopholes, like assassins having to honor a Marker that will break their own rules, but that just seems to be the way it goes -- John himself abuses of this system in the third movie, putting a lot of other people in danger, and then the High Table does what is expected of them -- punishing and going after the people who help John.",""
"170","CMV: It makes sense to judge people for promiscuity and to judge women for it more than men","If I hear that someone has had an excessive number of sexual partners, yes I am going to judge them for it and think less of them for it and I will apply this more to women than men. I don't think this is bad or misogynistic.Having sex is inherently risky behavior even when using ""safe"" sex methods. Every time someone has a new partner they are taking some risk of getting permanent, life-changing diseases. They are taking some risk of either getting pregnant themselves or getting someone else pregnant (for heterosexual encounters). And going home with strangers all the time carries some risk of being raped, assaulted, robbed, or murdered. The only reward for taking these risks is pleasure so in this way I view promiscuity similarly to other risky behaviors like gambling or impulsive shoplifiting. I will conclude that people who engage in it lack self-control and the ability to consider the consequences of their actions. While this does not make them inherently bad people, it means they are likely not people I want to be friends with or in a relationship with, and I don't see anything wrong with this. Judging others on some level is absolutely necessary even though it does have negative effects.As for why I judge women more, it's because all the risks I mentioned affect them more. Many STDs have more severe symptoms in women, pregnancy is a much greater burden than getting someone else pregnant, and women are more vulnerable to being attacked by their partner. Therefore a woman who has had a certain number of sexual partners has taken even more risk than a man who has had that same number.Two caveats to this: some people have a genuine addiction but I think this is a small proportion of promiscuous people so I assume it is not the case. And people having sex with others of the same sex are taking less of a risk, but they are still taking risk. In this case, promiscuous homosexual women are only slightly more risk-taking than promiscuous homosexual men.I don't see this as misogynistic because it comes from real differences between men and women and not some kind of stereotype or bias I have. But since this is considered an old-fashioned view that is discouraged by many people nowadays, I want to know if there's something wrong with it so I am posting here.CMV",""

The catholic church is still stuck in the middle ages and failed to appeal to the younger generations, which means that once the older generation perishes, the is noone to take their place. People tend to turn to religion in bad times when they need to believe in a higher power and we live in a very comfortable era of civilication.

"172","CMV: Politicians should travel as little as possible, and do almost everything from their offices.","Anytime a politician visits near me, or an event I also attend, I consider it a hassle. Why? Because they are going to be surrounded by a security detail, probably barricade streets and overall make the place harder to navigate for everyone else.For context I live in France, where this sometimes happens, and worse: in defiance of freedom of speech, the police/security guards remove mocking or critical posters or shirts on the politicians' path so they don't have to look at anything they don't like.In the age of information where means of remote communication are more widespread than ever, politicians causing disturbance by leaving their office seems redundant most of the time and is often only done for the sake of optics.For example, in the past year world leaders such as Biden, Macron, Scholz, Draghi and more traveled to Kyiv to visit Zelensky. Was it worth the hassle for a few photo ops when they could have had the same conversations remotely? On that topic, everyone seems to praise Zelensky for staying in Kyiv during the war but that just seems like an unnecessary risk unless he's somehow unable to command troops remotely. General De Gaulle fled to London during WWII and not many people hold it against him nowadays.There is also the topic of campaigning: for example, people held it against Clinton when she didn't visit Michigan. But why? Her policies are on her website, why do you need to see her in person? And if you don't trust her, she can lie to your face the same way she can on TV.There's also the issue of pollution caused by private jets. Of course relatively few people use them in the first place but even little bit counts, and if citizens are expected to pollute less, politicians should lead by example.Now to address a few counterarguments:1. Communications can be spied on or hacked. Sure, but they can be encrypted too, and if it was that big of an issue world leaders could NEVER talk on the phone, which they do.2. Are politicians not allowed to visit their families, or go on vacation? Sure but that shouldn't be anyone else's problem. If it's too risky for them to go without disturbing everyone else with a gigantic security apparatus, it's to risky for them to go period. Or they take on the risk personally: people criticized former president Hollande when he went to visit his mistress on a bike, but at least he didn't blockade Paris for that.3. Conspiracy time: if they don't appear in public, what if they are just figureheads and get replaced by someone else behind the scenes? Well politicians can be manipulated without the need for that, as shown by the South Korean president and her guru. Plus since officials have no legal obligations to uphold their program, you're not guaranteed to get what you voted for either way.On that last point, it's a bigger topic, but if politicians were more beholden to their program and could be swapped out for someone else applying the same program, there would be little point in assassinating them in the first place.

"173","CMV: Missing free throws can cost you wins.","Greetings everyone. As a fan of basketball I need to get this off my chest. I'm curious as to how folks will take this point of view. One of my favorite parts about basketball is the buzzer beater. Having watched a multitude of buzzer beaters, I noticed a pattern. Maybe it's just me, but I've seen most teams win on buzzer beaters after their opponent misses either one or both free throws. In some games, a team misses the second free throw on purpose to run down the clock. It may make sense in that you want to give your opponent less time to heave a 70 footer, but what if the 70 footer miraculously goes in before the buzzer? Then the team missing the free throw either has to play overtime or outright loses! Players should always make their free throws! I can give an instance back in 2010 when Chandler Parsons won the game for the Florida Gators against the NC State Wolf Pack. The Wolf Pack intentionally missed a free throw before CP25 drilled a 70-footer. I was thrilled that the Gators won, but the announcers puzzled me when they said that missing the second free throw was a wise move on the Wolf Pack's part. The game would have gone to overtime if the Wolf Pack made the second free throw. I welcome disagreements and counterarguments with open arms, eyes, and ears. If anything, I would appreciate if there's another reason to miss free throws.",""

I used this term rather than the term ""certainly wrong"" because I don't want to get into philosophical questions about whether absolute certainty is possible. ""You might be in the Matrix"" does not count as a reasonable doubt.* ""Studying it"": As a bare minimum, I want to say that you have to be able to accurately summarize the theory at a college undergraduate level, as well as the principal lines of evidence in its support, to dispute it. I am not saying everyone above that cutoff has the right to dispute the theory, but I am saying nobody below it should believe that the theory is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. (I am also not literally saying you must enroll in a college class.)As a clear example of what I'm talking about, consider someone who watches a creationist video on Youtube and decides that the theory of evolution is wrong beyond a reasonable doubt. This person is not being reasonable, provided that they know that they're disagreeing with the consensus.

"179","CMV: If a democratic government makes a mistake, its voters hold some of the blame","A democratic government represents the will of its people. Whenever you make a choice, it comes with some degree of responsibility for the outcome. If the people of a nation are given the choice over who serves in their government, voters have some degree of responsibility for the actions of the government they chose. When Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords, the rest of the world rightfully rolled their eyes at the US. Do the millions of Americans who voted for Trump not hold some degree of responsibility for such a backwards move in environmental protection? They willingly voted for a man who bragged about his plans to leave the agreement.If a government does something wrong, like wage an unjust war or deny its involvement in war crimes, it reflects on the will of the voters chose them in the first place.For example, Denmark deployed troops in the Iraq War. If you consider the invasion of Iraq to be unjustified, do the Danes not have some degree of responsibility for electing a government that decided to join the Iraq War? Denmark is not like Russia, a country where elites decide everything. Denmark is one of the most democratic countries in the world, so doesn't the actions of the government reflect the will of those who voted it into power?Another example, Japan routinely elects politicians who like to deny war crimes. The late PM Abe had close ties with Nippon Kaigi, an organization that claims Imperial Japan was a ""benevolent"" force for ""liberating"" Asia in WW2. Perhaps his original constituents in Yamaguchi liked him despite his war crime apologia, but doesn't this reflect the priorities of his voters? When his party elected him prime minister, doesn't this reflect the fact that Japanese voters think that war crime denial is justifiable as long as Abe delivers economic and military reform?",""
"180","CMV: AI highlights the exact issue with socialism and why it wouldn't work without being post-scarcity.","When I engage people on the merits of socialism I have one question that never gets answered: How do we distribute labor under socialism.It doesn't make sense that everyone is paid the same, or even within certain lower and upper bounds. A doctor has a skillset that might command 200k a year, and a Crab Fisherman also has a skill set that might command 200k a year. The difference here is that a doctor's skill set is in his ability to perform a task, while a crab fisherman's skill set is in his willingness to take on a risk to his life and limb. Under Capitalism, a Crab fisherman can make as much money as he wants correlated to the risk of his health and the price he puts on it. While the Doctor had opportunities to increase his wealth, they are ultimately marginal. There's only so many hours he's allowed to work in a week etc.So assuming everyone is paid roughly the same on some upper or lower band, wealth inequality can still exist, so long as private property rights exist.In the case of AI. It's a self contained technology that you can essentially build out on a homestead. You can provide your own Solar energy and purchase the needed components to run the AI, and then fully isolate and insulate yourself from socialism. Now, let's say I decide to leverage the AI on my property to work for me. Let's say I'm an accountant and Jeff is an accountant. I wouldn't ever share my AI with Jeff. I would improve my output with my AI, and then go back to browsing reddit or take on a second or third job. I don't have to disclose to my employer *how* I'm doing the work so efficiently, and even if I did it doesn't entitle him to my AI. He can either keep me as a very efficient employee or lose me to another firm where I will create the same amount of value.I'm sure this exists in less complex examples than AI. But AI is sort of the extreme end of this hypothetical. Under capitalism this would be a legitimate course of action, and its even encouraged. Under socialism this would be seen as disruptive and problematic and ultimately would create a tumor of wealth inequality for anyone who is simply more capable of utilizing and analyzing the value of their own time. What's more, the leverage acquired allows the individual to do the one thing that socialists don't want. Divorcing your time from the money you make. If you have 3 jobs you can manage in a 40 hour work week you are making triple the wages of everyone else around you, which means you can pay up to 2 increments of your wages to hire other people to make your life better. Even if you exist within a system you can subvert that system and essentially walk it back to capitalism *that works just for you.*To this end, short of enacting violence or stealing property from people, socialism can't work. Furthermore, *IF* the outcome of producing a revolutionary technology is to punish the person who made it by stripping them of their property for the common good, then that is the exact same disincentive to work hard that anti-socialists talk about. It literally promotes being a luddite because there's no reason to work hard or problem solve without some kind of upside for the person who goes out of their way to produce such technology.This is all a really complex end-state of the Socialist Toothbrush meme. Wherein if you own your toothbrush you can create a service cleaning toilets with it, and the government can't destroy private property rights otherwise people won't participate in the government. In this case AI is the new toothbrush, and it's held in a domain of your private property, but can still be used to render services better than anyone else. Unless socialism can solve for this, it can't work.",""

Statistically, men are twice as likely as women to be sentenced after a conviction, and receive sentences that are over 60% longer, which is even worse than the disparity between black and white people.Women outnumber men by an astounding 50% in higher education; if these numbers were reversed, you would already hear calls about ""sexist higher education institutions.""

"185","CMV: Drug decriminalization without legalization is dangerously illogical.","By ""decriminalizing"" drugs *while keeping their production and sale illegal* you are simultaneously reducing the costs of drug consumption while keeping all of the negatives of the drug war. First, ""decriminalization"" without legalization ensures those drugs will be sold by and directly profit the most violent criminal gangs on earth. By definition, it ensures no non-criminal will be able to produce or sell drugs. Besides foreign drug cartels, domestic gangs that cause the large majority of murders in North America will have their monopoly on a massively profitable business. Beyond the literal mass murder these gangs commit, keeping the supply of drugs illegal ensures they cannot be regulated in any way. That means keeping drugs far more dangerous than would be due to unknown potencies and adulterants, which we know contributes largely to drug overdoses.That also applies to taxation, which cannot be done on illegal transactions. As a result, we all lose out on tens of billions in lost tax revenue that instead goes directly to criminals and mass murderers. We also lose the ability to reduce demand through taxation, as we have done with cigarettes and alcohol. Every piece of economic theory and historical evidence has shown that going after suppliers simply makes it more profitable for the more ruthless violent cartels that remain, and pushes users towards more dangerous drugs. The current overdose crisis is a direct result of the government going after prescription opioids, which pushed pill users to unregulated heroin and eventually fentanyl.Reducing supply artificially just makes it even more profitable for those that remain by driving up the price (and incentivizing new entrants). We've done that so successfully that there are almost no criminal gangs on earth not involved in the drug business. The only countries that have largely eliminated drug use are places like Singapore, China, and Saudi Arabia. These places are differentiated by going after drug *users* with extreme punishments, which reduce demand for drugs and thus the profitability of selling them. This makes economic sense: reducing demand makes it less profitable for sellers, though it's probably political infeasible. By contrast, decriminalization *reduces* the effective costs of drug consumption, even if only somewhat. Given all of that, I think decriminalization is at best ineffective and at worst will increase drug use, while ensuring those drugs remain extremely dangerous and sold by violent criminals.",""

The algorithms have gotten really good at showing you the exact content that will keep you engaged, regardless of what impact said content may have. it doesn't matter if you're engaged because you're happy or because you're angry, what matters is you're engaged, and that often leads to you only seeing questionable content such fake news, outrageous extremist views, unrealistic expectations (such as life goals or body image), among other things. These have brought very serious real life consequences such as increased polarization due to people never leaving their online bubbles (sometimes going as far as actual violence being pushed by social media, seriously, it sometimes feels like some people stop seeing those that think differently as human beings at all) and all sorts of mental problems such as depression and feelings of isolation.And speaking of isolation, it feels like we're lonelier than ever, turns out replacing such a big chunk of our social interactions for likes, shares and status updates does not actually improve the quality of our social connections, it just makes our junky brains go brrr because someone clicked a button when they saw our post, but then you see an old friend in person and there's nothing to catch up on because you already know everything new in their life since they publicly share all of it.",""
"190","CMV: Film (and video games and books) would be better off if there could be no more than one sequel, and no spin-offs or remakes","Of the top [40 top grossing films of all time](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW), only 4 are the first in their series (Avatar, Titanic, Frozen, and Jurassic Park) and of those, only one could be said to be an original story (Avatar). Even if you expand to allow sequels, only 5 of the top 40 are sequels (Avatar 2, Top Gun: Maverick, Frozen 2, Incredibles 2, Pirates of The Caribbean 2), and 3 of those are nostalgia sequels (Avatar, Top Gun, and Incredibles) that came out at least a decade after the original.With the massive success of franchises, there is no need to create an original character, plot, or setting, as you will be outcompeted by a generic Marvel movie or Disney remake. Also, many recent movies have been much worse off because they hunt the moneybags from cinematic universes (The Mummy remake, DCEU, Dracula Untold), instead of just trying to make an interesting story. Franchises also create the problem where no character or world can be threatened as that would end the franchiseIf franchises are bad, then remakes are even worse. A franchise can get by with very little new content, but a remake, by definition, usually adds nothing at all. Spin-offs can vary from just leeching off of the original (Minions) to actually pretty good (Logan), but generally don't add more than an original story would have.I am willing to concede that sequels give the original more incentive to succeed and allow a successful original to get the resources it needs to have a fuller story. I also fully admit that there are some good movies in franchises, like The Batman. However, as a whole, I believe that franchises do more harm than good for creativity.Edit: OK, I will say that a complete story that is simply too long to fit into 2 movies (like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) could be acceptable, as long as it is one large story, rather than something like a Marvel or Pirates of the Caribbean movie that is a series of individual stories.

"191","cmv:The sex service industry must be legalized. Having sex is a human right, and no country is qualified to ban it.","  In many countries, prostitution is banned. Even in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most states. But we have to face these questions: Why are we banning prostitution? Is sex one of the basic human rights? Is banning prostitution the right thing to do?First of all, I can guess that some people (especially women) will say: if sex industry is legal, human trafficking will be a serious problem. I disagree with this view. For example, as long as a country allows people to use cars, there must be traffic accidents in this country, right? So, should we ban cars? The answer is of course no. So, if you think the problem of ""human trafficking"" is going to get serious, then you just need to step up efforts to crack down on traffickers, not ban prostitution.Then, some people will say: prostitution insults women. Or to put it another way: The porn industry doesn't respect women. Please, it's really hard for me to understand why you guys think this way. Isn't it fair that a whore has sex with me and I pay her? It's as if you go to work in a company and the boss pays you, it's the same.So, I can't think of any reason to ban prostitution at all.More importantly, having sex is one of the basic rights of human beings, and banning prostitution is a blatant violation of human rights. Can you imagine? A 20-year-old guy lives in pain every day because he can't have sex with girls (for various reasons, like he's too shy to approach girls). Do you think all this suffering he suffered was necessary? If he had been born in a truly free country (like Holland) where prostitution was possible, he wouldn't have suffered these things. I want to say that his country has violated his human rights, and such a country should be sanctioned by the United Nations. I hope that such a country will perish immediately.So let's all work together to legalize prostitution in every country! Hats off to the Netherlands!",""

"193","CMV: Comparing guns to vehicles does little to benefit either side of the argument, pro gun or pro gun control.","I constantly see people comparing guns to cars from both sides. Saying that, “cars cause tons of deaths every year too but we aren’t regulating cars.” And that “guns should be regulated the same way as vehicles.” Or that “cars are far more regulated than guns are”. I feel like all of these arguments are futile. First and foremost they’re two very very different things and to try and directly compare them isn’t really going to get you anywhere. Second of all this argument can be used for either side so what’s the point of really bringing it up if you’re being partisan on the issue? One side can say that guns should require insurance, registration, and safety requirements, plus a licensing system. Then the other side can say, you only need that to drive a car in public not to buy one, so with guns you’d be able to buy them without a background check and have a shall issue license for carrying in public that is valid in every state. If you’re standing for a middle ground take on firearms then this comparison benefits you I guess. But if you’re partisan on the issue then I don’t understand how this is a good comparison in any way",""
"194","CMV: Forcing artificial intelligence to pay or have someone else pay for it to view a dataset without imposing the same rules on organic intelligence is hypocritical, selfish, and likely comes from ignorance about one’s own nature as an organic machine","I realized at the center of ai art controversy, there is mostly money to be found as the reason for said controversy. Every video or story I’ve heard is about how the art belongs to the artist and AI should pay to train on it. It feels as if there is some level of correlation in these claims to those claiming non-fungible tokens are valid and copying them should be illegal. If a person views 5 different nft’s, learns the art style, and opens commissions for making similar art, should the nft creator be paid? Better yet, if an internet service provider allowed access to sites previously unreachable to the artist, but charges most of their income for it, leaving only room for payments of whatever the artist desired, should either of them be charged?And what happens when general intelligence is developed artificially? What of the biocomputers that have already been proven to function? Eventually the argument of “the intelligence isn’t human enough to count” will prove itself useless. And even though the intelligence is leagues behind ours, why does that allow for discrimination? We are just machines, certainly better than current ai but not forever. Do dumber things get special treatment because they are dumb, or rather, vastly inferior in every way but one? If so, why?The one argument that comes close is the human artist’s need for money, but that’s a capitalism problem, not an AI problem, and crippling AI won’t solve it, just temporarily prevent exacerbation of the situation.I am in a position where in order to pursue a dream, I need art. And to get the art I need from humans, I need money I don’t have and can’t get due to a crippling disorder. This is likely a source of bias, but I can’t find where it influences my logic to the point of invalidation. Hence my post.tldr: I just think artists can’t have it both ways without hypocrisy. Training with art made by humans for free while forcing non-human intelligence fractions to pay to train with their art seems hypocritical.Follow up question: if the developers of the AI only charged humans using the AI for the storage, power, and upkeep of the intelligence behind the art, would that make it more palatable?Edit: I need to sleep now, but the conversations have been excellent!

"195","CMV: Marijuana is the most dangerous and harmful drug in the world, posing more significant harm to society than any other drug.","I believe that marijuana is the most dangerous drug in the world and harms society more than any other drug. Yes, that includes drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine, crack cocaine and fentanyl.While I am aware of the argument that many of these other drugs have caused many deaths yet no deaths have been ""directly attributable to marijuana"", I believe that there are other dangers that are often ""invisible"" and not taken into account when considering the harm that a drug does to society as a whole.First, I want to begin by stating that I believe the widespread availability and social acceptability of marijuana potentiate the severity of marijuana's adverse effects on society because it discredits the seriousness of the drug's consequences (the following of which have been researched and evidenced). This is a significant factor in my view because I don't see how it doesn't open the door to widespread marijuana usage turning into what happened with cigarettes (with society widely accepting it as safe, only to regret it and deal with disastrous consequences decades down the road)\- Students who smoke marijuana have poorer educational outcomes than their nonsmoking peers \- Those who use it regularly may be functioning at a reduced intellectual level most or all of the time.   \-> Regular marijuana usage during periods of development in the adolescent brain has shown to be able to cause drops in IQ\- Heavy marijuana use has been linked to students being less likely to graduate high school, enroll in college or trade programs, and more likely to not want to seek employment. \- As perception of harm decreases, usage continues to increase.I believe that marijuana has robbed our collective society of so much productivity while also robbing its users of their potential. I can't help but imagine that out of the millions of people who have fallen victim to marijuana's consequences, society may have missed out on people who had the potential to accomplish things such as finding cures for rare diseases or cancers, but instead have had their futures stripped away from them by marijuana.I believe that these factors, along with the social acceptability of marijuana causing such factors to be exponentially more dangerous, are reasons to believe that marijuana is more dangerous to collective society than any other drug.\-",""
"196","CMV: Student loans should not be forgiven.","I have been following this topic on Reddit, in the news, and with friends, and have yet to hear a compelling argument for why student loans should be forgiven. I am a Democrat and will vote blue regardless of how SCOTUS rules, so please trust me that I am arguing in good faith. I also want to add that the wording of the 2003 HEROES Act ***does*** give the Executive branch the authority to forgive loans this way, regardless of my feelings. Let's dive into it. First off, student loan forgiveness fixes nothing. It will result in colleges realizing they can take in even more profit because these are guaranteed loans and eventually the government will take care of it anyway. There will be a huge financial incentive to increase education costs. Student loan forgiveness is also simply unfair. Nearly 90% of Americans do not have federal student loan debt. This action would be the most expensive executive order in history, and it helps an extremely small minority of people in America. That small minority is also statistically better off financially than their less educated fellow Americans. This does not help poor people, because the poorest people in America do not go to college at all. Let me also state that the current higher education system needs reworked. I wholeheartedly support some level of free higher education as part of a K-12 expansion, as ideally it would be used to encourage people to go into fields where there are major shortages (healthcare, education, etc). But that would be a future fix, not a retroactive fix for debt and terms that were already agreed upon. Here are some of the common arguments I've heard in favor of loan forgiveness and why I disagree. **1) We were told college was the only way to be successful, and loans were the only way to afford to go to college.** In America, people are considered adults at age 18. They can drive, vote, and convict fellow citizens as part of a jury. If 18 year olds are trusted to make these critical decisions, surely they can see how their choice of major affects their future earning potential. Also, basic economics is taught in all 50 states starting around middle school. There they explained basic compound interest and what principal is, and how the two effect each other. That being said, I would agree that a reduced interest rate cap, tied to the Federal Reserve rate, would be a good compromise to help struggling borrowers while still providing a guaranteed return to loan investors. **2) Student loans are predatory to young people because of the interest rate and the inability to discharge the loans in bankruptcy.** The average student loan rate is 5.8% according to the Education Data Initiative. That's on par with most mortgage rates from the early 2000's, and no one has said those rates were predatory. Student loans are unsecured debt, and bankruptcy only remains on credit reports for 10 years. Given that most student loans are expected to have terms longer than 10 years, there would be a huge incentive for young people to take out their loans and then immediately file for bankruptcy. With no collateral to repossess, no institution would provide the capital for these loans at all if they could be discharged. **3) Student loan forgiveness will boost the economy.** [***edit here:*** I'll leave my original wording below so everyone can see it, but a few commentors below have made good points specifically about my economic argument. The negative economic impact of 43 million of people being unable to save for future expenses/retirement will result in more than $10k worth of cost to all of us, if they end up forced into poverty and using other government safety nets.I am still not convinced that we should forgive student debt, but I acknowledge the economic argument was flawed.]I argue it will actually hurt the economy by making inflation worse. 43 million people will now have a sudden increase of hundreds of dollars per month in disposable income. Companies will know they can start charging more, because people can and will pay for it. This isn't just ""deleting"" debt, it is the equivalent of giving 43 million people a government funded pay raise. A penny saved is a penny earned after all. **4) Student loan forgiveness will help the Democrats politically.** Most independents and Republicans are staunchly against debt forgiveness if there are impacts to inflation, tuition, or increased college degree requirements. There is even a sizable segment of Democrats who are against forgiveness as well. Again, nearly 90% of Americans will get no benefit from debt forgiveness, and people are frustrated about that. To put that in perspective, nearly 27% of Americans are on Medicaid, more than twice the number of federal student loan borrowers. It seems to me this is a bad political policy. Sorry this was so long, but I look forward to hearing some well thought out arguments in favor of SLF. Thanks.",""
"197","CMV: Rebuses are a crutch used by lazy crossword creators to cram in otherwise-crappy words whenever they're not crafty enough to fit them into their puzzles crisply.","Now I don't want to come across as cruddy or crass, but just completed yesterday's  NYT Thursday crossword and now I'm critical of any crossword that requires rebuses to solve correctly.For those unaware, a rebus is a ""creative"" tool used in crossword puzzles where several letters are [crammed into a single square](https://i.imgur.com/CRwampR.jpg) to make two intersecting answers work that wouldn't otherwise fit together. (A [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/crosswords/yes-you-can-write-more-than-one-letter-in-a-square.html) provides additional explanation and examples.) While in theory this could be an interesting new element for inveterate crossword puzzlers, in practice it's usually more frustrating than challenging. After all, nothing's more fun than wracking your brain for a particular six-letter answer that actually turns out to be eleven letters fit into six squares. And because rebuses are only in a small percentage of crosswords and rarely hint that you need to use one, it's always much more likely that you just can't think of the right answer rather than that you need to treating some of the squares like goddamn clown cars.Now I acknowledge that some people manage to find rebuses fun, in much the same way I imagine as people who have fun playing Calvinball, or slamming two dozen Carolina Reapers back-to-back. I realize there's no accounting for fun, but that's not what I'm arguing here: my position is that, fun or not, rebuses detract more from crossword puzzles than they add.For what it's worth, many rebuses will attempt to at least use the same cluster of letters in both answers (for example, [using a `JACK`rebus](https://i.imgur.com/h19lMMO.png) to make LUMBER**JACK** and **JACK**STRAW fit together), but others don't even bother to do that much. Instead they just jamb their conflicting letters over one another ([like this one](https://i.imgur.com/gMwGXoZ.png)) in the same way a kid might ""solve"" their sudoku puzzle by squeezing two numbers in one box because they can't figure out how to make the rows and columns fit together. While some rebuses may be better executed than others, it doesn't change my opinion that relying on rebuses to complete your crossword is analogous to relying on scissors to complete your jigsaw puzzle: fun perhaps and maybe even a little clever at times, but a cheap and inelegant way to go about a puzzle. In my view, one of the most important aspects of good crossword craftsmanship is being clever and concise enough to weave a large number of wildly different answers into one another seamlessly, especially if you can do so with a consistent theme throughout. This is the reason Will Shortz is arguably the greatest alive, and I consider it a shame when he wedges the occasional rebus in because I know he's capable of so much better.____________________# TL;DR* Rebuses are a cheap challenge that break the flow of crossword-solving, but they're not included frequently enough to make them feel like part of the rules.* Squeezing a bunch of tiny letters into a tiny box is weird and harder to read, especially when done in writing.* Rebuses are used as a crutch by puzzlesmiths when they can't figure out how to make things fit together neatly, and make the puzzles inherently less impressive from a craftsmanship point of view. Crosswords with rebuses are almost always lower quality than rebus-free crosswords.  * This is especially true for rebuses that don't even bother to use the same letters for the intersecting answers.* I'm not arguing people can't like or enjoy rebuses in their puzzles, but rather that they generally detract more than they add and should therefore be omitted wherever possible.

"198","CMV: Mansplaining as a term is overused, if it even deserves to exist at all","I think that the term mansplaining is just a copout term that lets women shut down any man they perceive to be condescending. This term is defined using very subjective wording and intention; to someone with a victim complex, everyone is condescending, but a self assured and confident person sees nothing as condescending (examples, don't use them as hard references). Masculine communication style is characterized by a fact based approach using data, statistics, and clear statements. This style also tends to be or seem more dominating or assertive upon presentation. Women could be in conversation with a man who uses this communication style, who may genuinely not know the woman's depth of knowledge on any given topic, and still claim mansplaining because of the man's direct and flat approach to the engagement. I know there are times when a man could know full well they know nothing about the topic compared to the woman, and still try to be a dick and talk over them. The problem here is that they can also do it to a man as well, just as a woman can exhibit this behavior to either sex. Its not mansplaining if the guy was using a masculine communication style, had good intention, and was simply ill-informed without knowing he was. People make mistakes, everyone's wrong at some point, why do some women shriek mansplaining any time they perceive a man to be trying to maliciously correct them? Not everyone you think has bad intent really does, and its just as likely for a woman to feel offended by a man who's just trying to engage in conversation in the way he does with other men. The people who genuinely ""mansplain"" are usually not actively singling out women; they're probably just narcissistic (not saying they are true narcissists) and feel that most people are less qualified than they are. The remainder are sexist,simple. Just call it sexism and stop using extra terms for already established concepts.EDIT: ""When the goal is independence, members of this speech community are likely to communicate in ways that exhibit knowledge, refrain from personal disclosure, are abstract, are focused on instrumentality, demonstrate conversational command, are direct and assertive, and are less responsive. Showing knowledge in conversation gives speakers the opportunity to present themselves as competent and capable. If someone has a problem at work one might respond, “You should do this …” or “The best way to deal with that is …” This strategy is sometimes referred to as a “communication tool box.” While some may interpret this as bossy, responding in a manner that tries to fix a problem for someone you care about makes a lot of sense."" This is from [here](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-introductiontocommunication/chapter/are-there-really-differences-in-gender-communication-styles/), hence where i got the masculine communication thingEDIT: It didn't take long to realize a lot of misinterpretation has happened. I know sexism exists, i know it's been a pervasive problem in humanity since forever, i know not every male has this communication style, and i'm not trying to explain away sexist behavior.  I'm not saying you can't be narcissistic and sexist. The examples i gave were examples, not the hill i'd die on using for every instance. I'm aware theres different factors that attribute to it's use, that's why i gave factors that support the idea that it's being mis/overused in the first place. To summarize everything, mansplaining as a term shouldn't be used at all because of how easy it is for people to misunderstand its definition, and use it for their own agendas. No, not everyone misuses it for their own agendas. I can't just list every single reason, but a few more are that it's also used simply as an insult, to shut down a conversation, to have control over a conversation for whatever reason, and/or to evoke unnecessary negative emotion. This list was not exhaustive.Final edit: i found alot of interesting and earnest responses, to which i am thankful for the opportunity to read and reply to. Unfortunately, there were enough responses filled with their own share of condescension and insults to prove to me more that this as a term is ridiculous. A noticeable section of support for its use comes from people who are hardly mature enough to refrain from blatantly cursing me out, but not enough to think without emotion clouding their views. I guess my view was changed in a way, because now im certain that mansplaining as a term is unnecessary and just adds fuel to a fire, that fire wont be explained because at this point its painfully clear that most of you will assume what you want anyway. This was disappointing. I wont be responding or humoring this anymore, but i hope it stays up for future readers to use as their own reference, whether it be for or against what i've learned through this headache of an experience.",""

There’s this particular planet [Kepler -186f](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/2081/where-the-grass-is-always-redder/)( similar enough to earth that has a different star then we do, meaning the lightwaves would cause the trees in the planet to all be red instead of green. Doesn’t that observation alone prove the existence of aliens??? Aliens could be bacteria or tiny 1 cellular organisms , this is where I get into conspiracy mode . The 4th dimension , and beyond that is physically impossible to conceptualize to 3rd dimensional creatures such as us. Learn more here, video is very interesting. [here](https://youtu.be/JmvHNatZgVI) soI wonder , what could live in the other dimensions alone? And sticking to just the 3rd dimension, scientists believe life needs the same basic ingredients (organic matter, water, and to be in the habitable zone of its star) and that’s just a hypothesis. How do we know other planets don’t have elements we don’t have ? We can assume the planets in our solar system are mostly composed of the same compounds in different amount’s  because the collision that caused our planets to be formed pretty much just shot into huge chunks that over time turned into our planets and moons. But way beyond our galaxy is there not a possibility for more elements to exist ? And these elements could potentially play much different roles in evolution then the elements we have here on earth. Maybe I’m a huge dummy but not believing In aliens seems more probable than them just not existing. I feel like perhaps we’ve found evidence of aliens and we condition ppl into not believing people. I mean think about it, when have u ever heard someone say “I saw a ufo” and your first reaction wasn’t “this bitch done lost their mind”  there have been sightings( supposedly, but hey some have weight to them imo) even on live footage sense before smart phones and digital editing. But take that with a grain of salt, this isn’t contingent to my argument I just find that there have been too many sightings for a couple to not be somewhat accurate right? But I’ll admit I’m reaching on that one. So basically I fully believe in aliens and maybe 5% think we’ve spotted them, or      entered our planet. Like how can they just not exist?The article I listed doesn’t say there ARE plants on that planet, when I wrote this I remembered it wrong. We don’t know for sure there is plants on Kepler 186f and that was my Trojan horse so, yeah I still believe in thembut just wanted to make sure y’all know I wasn’t intentionally misleading anyone",""

One labeled “Run Forest Run” which is displayed when the customers at that table do not require any assistance and “Stop Forest Stop” which is displayed when the customers need something like putting in an order, wanting to pay the bill, refills, etc. The idea is that when the stop sign is displayed, the first available server will address your needs.**My proposal** – Most chain restaurants (for example Applebee’s, BWW, Chilis, Outback, etc.) should implement a similar system where customers can easily denote whether they need a server’s attention and once the “Stop Forest Stop” equivalent sign is displayed, the first available server will help them. In my mind this has a few benefits including: not wasting the server’s time checking in on tables that don’t require assistance, increased table turnover from customers spending less time waiting for the bill/ordering, less variability in service quality since you’re not dependent on an assigned waiter, and most importantly getting rid of awkwardly trying to make eye contact with the waiter to get their attention.There are two complications I can think of if this system was implemented. First is with tips which in my opinion should be pooled if this were to be implemented. This would incentivize everyone to turn over tables quickly and respond to stop signs promptly. While there may be an issue with freeloading from some staff, a manager noting which servers tends to stop at tables more frequently and addressing the issue with the offending employee should offset that issue. The second complication would be with large parties (7+ people) where waiters may avoid serving due to the extra amount of work. In the case of large parties, while the signs would still be at the table to address small items like issues with food and refills, waiter(s) would be assigned for things like taking orders and they would receive at least a larger portion of tip left by the large group.Full disclosure: I’ve never worked at a restaurant which is why I think my view may be flawed in some way.",""
"201","CMV: Cis heterosexual’s men public lack of attraction to trans women is social, not biological","To start off, you’ll often hear and read that only gay men can be interested in trans women, and a straight identified man who is honest about their attraction to one is a lying bisexual or closeted gay man because that attraction is inherently homosexual. I disagree and I think the aversion that heterosexual men in the west tend to have towards trans women publicly (because many will admit it in private) is due to society and how their culture has shaped their understanding of sexuality along with stigmatization[Attraction to trans women is gynephilic in nature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27858199/), and the men who are *mostly or exclusively* attracted to trans women show arousal patterns that align more with heterosexuality. I think heterosexual men can **naturally** be attracted to trans women like [Bailey Jay](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/bart_calendar/8134480/107163/107163_600.jpg), [Kataluna Enriquez](https://people.com/thmb/uLAmgMVeljBv1VslKYYkKTVsjeM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(490x205:492x207)/miss-nevada-5444748d1fbc45a6ad6ab0cf208f21ae.jpg), [Amiyah Scott](https://s24193.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amiyah_Scott_Feature_Image.png), and if they possess a penis then they might be deemed **less** attractive than a cis female that’s equal to them in looks, but the attraction doesn’t die completely because they still possess a phenotype that leans far more female. Losing all attraction upon learning trans status is socially influenced I believe that attraction in general tends to be to a combination of things like phenotype and gender expression : - For much of human history, and prior to christendom in the west, it was normalized to have sex with feminine males. It wasn’t deemed gay nor was it stigmatized, and as a result most heterosexual men would partake in this- In American Samoa there is a third gender category called fa’afafine who are comprised of feminine males. In that culture fa’afafine are well accepted, and not only do most people claim to be friends with one, most of the men in that culture have had sexual relations with a fa’afafine. This is not considered gay nor is it stigmatized- In Oaxaca, Mexico among the Istmo Zapotec, there is a third gender category known as Muxes which is comprised of feminine males. These feminine males do not have relationships with each other but exclusively date and sleep with men that are considered straight. This is such a normalized practice that these Muxes are seen as legitimate competition by heterosexual women for male attention. [Up to 85% of Istmo Zapotec women have reported to have competed against a Muxes for a man](https://newslinesamoa.com/canadian-university-study-looks-at-sexual-competition-between-samoan-women-and-faafine/)Taking all of that into consideration, the unattraction and at times even repulsion to trans women that western straight men in particular express is influenced by their culture due to how sexuality is constructed in their society, as opposed to being some biological reaction because they’re not gay. Heterosexual men are responsive to both sex and gender (fem/masc), so I do believe in general they’re more physically attracted to cis females, but they’re not naturally unattracted and repulsed by a trans woman, especially one who is post-op and is externally phenotypically female. Attraction to trans women is not inherently homosexual",""

That's like saying the Cowboys suck because a 49ers fan told you so2) If it was the devil's influence, why would I be punished for doing his bidding? If your mom tells you to wash the dishes and you go wash the dishes, she's likely not gonna punish you for it3) The Bible highlights things such as eternal life and no sickness in heavy/paradise earth, but even if those things aren't absent in hell, what's it gonna do, kill you?

"204","CMV: before we restrict abortions, shouldn't we at least make it easier for women to raise a child first","We all no abortion is trying to be banned by pro-birthers. My argument has NOTHING to do with ""ethics"" and ""religious views"" because that changes from person to person. My argument also has nothing to do if the woman shouldn't have sex or not because there are many women who need abortions on a wanted baby due to medical reasons. There is also the fact that men will S/A women and get them pregnant.My point is, if they wanted more women to give birth and keep their baby ""like how they're supposed to be"" instead of forcing them, (ie: make them into a life support for something that isn't alive that CAN kill said life-support), they would at least make it easier to raise a child?For example, many places get extended pre-natal and post-natal care for the mom for wayyyy cheaper than the US, this includes counseling because who knew that your whole mental state is altered. Furthermore, women in the us sometimes barely get 6 weeks off maternal leave (half the time it's unpaid, yet necessary in the healing process).So shouldn't we lower the cost of medical if not almost get rid of it because you want people to have babies that are healthy while keeping the mom alive right? But she can get hurt or even die from pushing herself just before or after giving birth, that's why leave is necessary, but yet many have to skip it/cut it short because they cannot afford it and will be out of a home. Thus the government taking the baby. unless we make mandatory paid maternity leave longer (paternity if father is single and has full custody).Additionally we should also have immediate public housing for pregnant/just birthed moms that are trying to get up on their feet (for the most part clean/sober just hit hard times expesh if they got fired early pregnancy and couldn't work and/or no one would hire them). this will help alleviate stresses that CAN affect the fetus and child after it is born. because we want both the mom and child to be alive and happy, not just exist right?Contributing to that factor is childcare, this includes schools, programs, daycare, nutrition supplements, clothing, and medical.While yes we do have help, (ie churches that want you to convert to get said resources even though they can and actively pursuit harm to other people including lgbtqia) discount daycare, public schools that are already shitty, food stamps that pro-birthers often fight against, and medicaid - medicare and cash assistance.They almost always have a cash cutoff that's far below the poverty line and need to be raised so that a family can take care of all needs instead of worrying for the light bill or a weeks worth of food. the Medicaid and Medicare NEEDS to be improved and less of a hassle. schools need more funding that goes to anywhere and everywhere but sports.Lastly, many women DO keep their baby after the father says he'll stay, but walks on out of their lives. in order to support her family, she needs to work a singular job that pays bills, but now and days it's not enough so RAISE minimum wadge.This part is BEFORE their even pregnant:Make rapists have harder jail sentencesGive PROPER sex education (not abstinence)Don't shame women who come forward with a rape story (the odds have risen it's 1in4 and that's JUST the reported)Don't downplay married rape/cohersionstop making it about purity cultureMake it easier to get sterilization for women/bcDon't just blame the woman and blame it ALL on her, it takes twotake domestic abuse SeriouslyCOMPLEATLY reform the cps, adoption and foster system (everyone knows it's a HORRIBLE system)Fix inflationFix the current housing situationThis is not asking for pregnant women and women with children to get handouts, more that it is unreasonable to expect women to have children when they can barley support themselves. Many countries do not have our issues as bad (not including rape/domestic abuse) and get along fine. and if you find that fixing (at least SOME things) as i said in above unreasonable then you are not pro-life you are just pro-birth. you do not care about the woman, nor what happens to the baby after it is born. but if you agree (at least a little bit) then you should also see as that will automatically (if only slightly) decrease the amount of abortions.I do know that i left many out that can be added/fixed/tweeked&#x200B;***EDIT/CONLUSION:***Everyone is ok with abortions just being restricted and this is the solution that answered the hard question&#x200B;Pro lifers believe that a fetus no matter the state deserves life.(a good portion of prolifer's) it's the ""payment"" for ""messing around(if i have this right let me know but) :most pro-lifers are ok with abortions ONLY if it is medically necessary ***or*** from rape(one or two pro-lifer's) are ok with aborting EARLY (like in the first five weeks)(a few pro-lifer's) are in support to help said moms give birth and ultimately to a more increase of wanted pregnancies.they do support mom over fetus, as long as it doesn't kill/severely maim the mom, the mom should push through it.&#x200B;I as a pro-choicer believe that:fetus shouldn't have a right to life until viability outside of the womb, before that it is the choice of the mom because it is not alive, but at that state of time it ***could*** surviveRight now we are the  55th, falling behind Russia which has a maternal mortality rate of 17 maternal deaths per 100,000 live birthsI  feel like this shouldn't be as much of a problem as long as healthcare improves and hire more people, put until then it is a concern to not have at least have restricted abortionI feel like better sex education is key in preventing a lot of pregnancies and that the ""payment"" or blame falls too much mainly on the woman.&#x200B;***Final result:***Until medical is better for women who are pregnant, we need at least a restricted abortion acceptance. for non emergency medical condition concernsit should be available until the fetus is viable outside the womb (just because it is human, it is not A human. it is more like trying to give someone's lung a right to live, unless that lung is viable outside and can live on its own)Rape reasons should always get a pass for abortions, along with medically necessary abortionsbetter support for women in certain areas will further the want to have and continue a pregnancyLastly it shouldn't just mainly fall on the women, a proper sex education is required to prevent many unwanted pregnancies it also isn't a ""punishment""Do people agree? let me knowit is the best i can come up with",""
"205","CMV: small voice recorders and discrete cameras should be allowed in school","The reason I say this is because of bullying in school. As a first hand victim of school bullying(2 years in a row) the reason the bullies weren’t punished was because of a “lack of evidence” and frankly security cameras are not enough as they are normally low res and don’t capture audio/ unable to capture audio because of how loud a classroom is. Allowing these small recording devices (implanted in hats, glasses and stuff) will prevent bullies from bullying as the victim now has concrete evidence to report and get the bully properly punished. If I was allowed to carry around recording devices when I was In school I would’ve been able to successfully report that student, get that student punished and removed from the classroom. What happened instead is he didn’t get punished and I was stuck with him for another 6months of constant bullying. If a student is not comfortable with that then they should switch to online class or homeschooling where bullying can be tracked with very hard to erase evidence or bullying doesn’t happen at all. And since everything already does get recorded in society so why should it be any different in schools(Sorry for bad English it isn’t my first language)",""
"206","CMV: Online ""thots"" (as in seductive TikTokers, streamers, etc.) can be good wives.","When I'm scrolling through comments in these girls' profiles in social networks, I often read demeaning comments saying that these girls are ""high mileage"" and that they have no value as potential wives and will eventually get old without anyone by their sides.I think this argument is completely nonsense. First because showing your body online as a hustle does not imply having a multitude of sexual partners IRL.As a matter of fact, most online ""thots"" are in the game for the money, so it would not make sense for them to be having sex with a lot of men for free. And even though there are escorts that decide to also become online ""thots"", many girls who work with sex online do so because they'd not be comfortable having actual sexual intercourse with clients.So, this whole ""sexual exposure"" is a money thing: It does not relate to the ""thot"" wanting to fuck several guys, let alone to develop emotional bonds with 'em. Therefore, her online ""thot"" hustle wouldn't necessarily imply she given you less attention or cheating on you.Actually, she can likely give you more attention than the average woman, as she has a higher ""pay received to time worked"" ratio than the average individual.And given that many of these online ""thots"" make big sums of money by themselves, they have less reason to try to ""marry up"" than a housewife or the typical working class girl — so they actually have lower odds of being ""goldiggers"" or cloth chasers than people who have no gold or cloth by themselves.Actually, I've been friends with several in person sex workers in my life and they're often the ""providers"" in the relationship. I can't see why that wouldn't apply to online ""thots""....Therefore, up until now we can conclude that online ""thots"" aren't necessarily more promiscuous than any regular girl, that they have more time available to devote to your relationship with her and less reason to be a golddigger and more means to provide you nice experiences with her money....Now, let me address one of the counterarguments that you may bring: ""they may have mental health issues"".As a matter of fact they can, but so can the average person. Anxiety and depression are commonplace in the modern world, and it is understandable, given that most people have to work long stressful hours and can get little sleep — plus, we usually have poor family education and don't properly handle bullying in schools.The online overexposure of the ""thots"" can bring them mental distress, but they're also less likely to face some of the stressors that other people face.And even if you could prove that on average the ""thots"" have worse mental health, that would not mean that there aren't some online ""thots"" that are mentally healthy and just chose this career path as a way to maximize their economic return in a though economic environment.Last but not least, for those who'd argue ""What will our child think?"", ""Our son you will be bullied!"":If people are judgemental towards ""thots"", that's on their own stupidity.A properly raised son won't resent a loving and caring mother because of her career choices. And a properly raised son will learn how to defend himself and his family from insults, not letting himself be oppressed by the opinion of those that are ignorant and biased. This experience, as a matter of fact, may help him become a much stronger man in the future....PS.: I never said that all online ""thots"" must be good wives. But I argued they aren't by any means worse options in comparison to other women, and even have some advantages in relation to them, especially if they're successful in their field.",""

"211","CMV: Reparations for black people should be gauged on the reparations for Japanese internees","Reparations for slavery and other systemic forms of racism have been discussed over the years, and it seems we may be close to a head on these discussions.My view is that these discussions should be contextualized by the reparations the US government actually paid to Japanese who were interned in camps during WWII. The simple fact is that nobody who is alive today in the United States was enslaved. Neither were their grandparents, or their great grandparents, or their great-great grandparents. That is not a wrong that can be effectively redressed today simply because nobody who is alive today was directly affected by it. However, there is very real systemic racism that occurred recently, in the 1960s federally and several years afterwards in individual states. Reparations are not something that I was initially receptive towards, but I have conceived a path forward on this matter. Japanese internees during WWII were paid a total of $1.6b in 1992. Adjusted for inflation, this amounted to just over $41,000 for every living person who had been interned. I don't know about you, but I personally believe that being interned by force in camps trumps anything black people encountered in the 1960s and beyond. So giving every black person alive today $40,000 is an insult to the Japanese internees. I don't think we can seriously say that being ripped from your home and forced into camps is better than being segregated by race. It's not in the same ballpark, and it's the closest this country has gotten to slavery since the Civil War. I would propose that every black person alive today be given a cash amount between $10,000 and $20,000. I've heard crazy proposals of giving black people $5 million, and I've of course heard arguments that no reparations are necessary. This is my compromise. And one could say that we shouldn't use the Japanese reparations as a baseline, because the Japanese internees should've been paid more. On that I agree. However, even if we had paid Japanese internees more, I don't believe that would raise the bar for black people subjected to segregation all that much. The simple fact of the matter remains that internment is a hell of a lot worse than segregation. So I would support $10,000 to $20,000 to every living black American today. I, who up until very recently thought reparations as a concept were absurd. I don't think you can find many people who would truly support more than that, nor is it even feasible to pay more than that. If you think inflation is bad now, just wait until 33 million people have an extra $10,000 in their pocket all at once. That would actually hurt the people reparations are trying to help in the long run.",""
"212","CMV: Basketball should replace free throws with 30-second penalties","Free throws are insipid. Basketball needs a way to punish fouls that doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes with a melon baller.In other sports, giving the aggrieved team a free shot on goal isn't boring at all. Penalty shots in sports like hockey, lacrosse, and soccer are gripping. Without a goalie, the drama of a free shot plummets.Basketball also uses penalty shots (free throws) far, far more than other sports. In soccer, there's a penalty shot [once every four games](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308873835_A_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Penalty-Kicks_in_the_English_Premier_League). In hockey, there are only [40-70 in the entire league each season](https://hockeyanswered.com/what-is-a-penalty-shot-in-hockey/). Basketball games average [over 40 free throws per game](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/free-throws-attempted-per-game)[\*]. This is absurdly high. [Over 15% of all scoring comes from banal free throws.](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/percent-of-points-from-free-throws)It's clear that free throws are a cancer on the entertainment value of basketball. But how else can you punish fouls?Hockey solved this problem long ago with the penalty box. When a player commits a foul in basketball, they should have to leave the court for 30 seconds, giving the other team a 5-on-4 power play.This would be far more exciting than free throws. Instead of pausing the game to bore fans, a 30-second penalty would create a temporary imbalance of power, which is the easiest way to generate excitement and drama.Is 30 seconds the right amount of time for a penalty?I'm not sure. Maybe it should be 60 seconds. Maybe only 20. Experimentation would determine the optimal penalty length.Would shorthanded teams simply hold onto the ball when they get it and wait for the penalty to expire?This is part of the reason I suspect the optimal penalty length is about 30 seconds. This isn't much more than the length of one possession, so the percentage of penalty time where the shorthanded team has possession would likely be small.It's possible the power play team would try to score as quickly as possible to maximize the advantage they can get from the penalty. But then I don't think it would be wise for the shorthanded team to wait out the penalty, since they won't want to be left with only ~10 seconds on their shot clock when the power play ends.Even if shorthanded teams find time-wasting tactics, that's a tiny downside. First, this would still be less boring than free throws. Second, we could solve this by switching from a penalty lasting a set length of time to making it last a set number of possessions—probably one or two, but maybe three. Then the incentive to waste time would be gone.Would penalties have any negative effects on how games end?Basketball should adopt [Elam Endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam_Ending). But whether or not this happens, I think penalties would have positive effects on the final minutes of games. The risk/reward calculation for intentional fouls would be much less tempting, so games would end with teams playing real basketball instead of taking a plethora of free throws. And if you dislike Elam Endings for some reason, penalties would fix many of the problems of basketball game endings while preserving the current timing system.Free throws are excruciatingly boring. Basketball should replace them with a penalty system similar to the one that's worked well in sports like hockey for a long time. But I'm going to bet lots of basketball fans disagree with me, so I'm willing to change my view.[\*] This chart lists free throw attempts per game in the 20-27 range. I believe this is on a per team basis, so the real average number of free throw attempts per game is double this.",""

"214","cmv: Executive pay does not make up a meaningful portion of most large US companies' budget, and thus cutting it would do little for the average worker","When discussing the topic of equality in the US, I often hear record-high executive pay mentioned as one of the primary reasons why wages have remained stagnent while productivity has increased.To look into this more, I decided to create a spreadsheet of 45 companies in the S&P 500 divided evenly among all major sectors. For each company I measured, it's total number of employees, total executive pay (by adding up the pay of the executives listed on Yahoo Finance), annual dividend payout, and annual share repurchase spending. Upon recording these numbers for each company, I created these three metrics which ended up having the following median values:Annual executive pay per employee -> $227Annual dividend payout per employee -> $39,606Annual share repurchase spending per employee -> $29,093As you can see, executive pay per employee equates to only about 3 days of minimum wage work per year, whereas the median dividend payout per employee is actually higher than the median annual salary in the US. That's not even to mention that the median share repurchase spending per employee is just shy of the median income in the US.(**Note**: In my findings most companies had a high dividend payout, and significantly lower spending on buybacks, or high spending on buybacks, and a significantly lower dividend payout. So, looking at the median for both could create the misperception that companies are spending a lot of money on both, when in reality most companies are paying mostly one or the other.)Seeing this clear disparity leads me to believe that the discussion around executive pay is pointing at the wrong thing. If workers want a stake in the profits of their company, the bulk of the money is clearly in dividends and share buybacks. I realize that rich executives flying in private jets as their company lays off workers isn't exactly a great look, but the numbers seem to imply that that isn't making a big difference. In my research, I found that executive pay was consistently measured in millions of dollars, whereas dividends and buybacks were usually measured in billions, and as the saying goes,""The difference between a million dollars and a billion dollars is roughly a billion dollars""",""
"215","CMV: Radical Political Factions in the US Will Dominate the Future","Radical (defined as seeking radical change to the status quo in the US) political factions in the US will dominate the future in the short and long term because:TLDR: economy is going down, polarization is going up, moderates and their influence is draining away (slowly). Strong leaders that want to change things greatly are needed or at the very least will be perceived as being needed in order to help the US adapt to turbulent times. * First, the economy has nowhere to go but down in the status quo for the majority of the population. My understanding of the status quo is that it is a sort of compromise between [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism) and [modern liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States) in moderate Democrat style (free trade, freer immigration, limited regulation, progressivism/egalitarianism) or a sort of compromise between neoliberalism, [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism), and liberal conservatives (meaning classical liberals who pro-police, imprisonment, socially conservative) under a Republican style (privatization, deregulation, substantial lowering of taxes for the wealthy and corporations, conservatism). This system causes economic problems for the majority of the population because of the increasing level of competition from industrializing countries and the inability of the US government--with a moderate Democrat controlled, moderate Republican controlled, or divided status--to be dynamic enough to keep up with changing and challenging conditions in the US/world.(CMV) It could be argued that one of these ideologies (neoliberalism, modern liberalism, liberal conservatism, classical liberalism) is particularly good and/or appealing and thus will become dominant over the others and create a new but somewhat moderate status quo, or that I have misconceived the political system in the US.* Second, the moderates in each party, who are currently dominant politically, will do wildly unpopular things or popular things that are harmful in the long run in a desperate effort to hold onto their current power, which is naturally fading because of how much radicalism there is in the US and how it grows every single year. This includes but is not limited to: simply not changing enough, which is the tendency of moderates in the US today ([this will be unpopular because increasingly, younger voters are demanding a more activist government](https://ibb.co/WypX9c4)), climate change / environmental issues denial or lackluster response to this issue, endorsement of anti-LGBTQ views ([approx 20% of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ, this number has not stopped growing yet](https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx)), endorsement of racism, suppression of current democratic elements and proposed ones, allowing government positions to remain dominated by the wealthy, bad policies in cities caused by NIMBY (not in my backyard) Democrats and competition with suburbs, suburbs themselves in their current state being vehicles of depression and inequality for the majority of residents, etc.(CMV) It could be argued that any of these aspects are not really an issue (but if you mention one issue to get a delta you should back it up with evidence properly), particularly that I have a misconception on local politics in cities or suburbs, providing significant new info on rural area politics and status). I wouldn't advise arguing that there is a large moderate faction that is capable of not doing dumb things, because simply by their nature they are in opposition with the majority of ""activist"" millennials and zoomers, BUT if you see an error I have made logically there, then you have a CMV case to make.&#x200B;(that was a ton of writing, may add more sources or bullets if I think of new things but I think this is plenty to discuss).&#x200B;Generally my conclusion is that the radical factions will fight and one will eventually rise to the top. The options are:* Social democrats like Bernie Sanders, likely in coalition with democratic socialists and those even further left.* Dog-whistling to or open alliance with right-wing evangelicals, those against egalitarianism generally, and confederates/neonazis/fascists from right-wing populists like Donald Trump. Right wing populists could go in the direction of protectionism or simply continued tax cuts, though I don't see how even more tax cuts can be supported without the US suffering catastrophically.* Not libertarians, because they are not ""activist"". Unless things are going radically downhill and championing basic liberties becomes exceptional (hoping I'm not jinxing things here).* You can add factions to change my view :)* Another big final CMV could be that the US is strong enough in its current state / naturally as a nation that moderates like Biden, while potentially not being super popular or effective, could decrease radicalism simply by making modest improvements that allow the US to perform efficiently enough to stay stronger than other nations. Counterpoint: there will be development that could be harmful to much of the working class in South Africa, Nigeria, that Eastern African Union, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Latin America.",""
"216","CMV: Even though I’m an atheist, I think casual sex is wrong","Two arguments have led me to this conclusion, even though I’m not religious: first, that the casual view of sex makes it hard to explain the special wrongness of rape, and second, of adult-child sex. The “love” view of sex does a better job of explaining our moral intuitions in both cases. (My method is John Rawls’ approach to [applied ethics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_equilibrium) known as reflective equilibrium — see the link for an explanation if needed.)1. The first argument: A Casual View of Sex cannot account for the special wrongness of rape:Most people think rape would be wrong even if the victim was unconscious and never found out it occurred. What this means is that the wrongness of rape cannot be entirely explained by an appeal to its harmful effects on utility. Also, if the perpetrator of a rape derived more utility from the rape than the victim suffered in disutility, the rape would still be wrong. Finally, if the rapist were to make the victim better off all things considered by donating to the victim afterwards the rape would still have been wrong (even though the victim wouldn’t have been harmed on utilitarian reasoning, since they weren’t made worse off). The special wrongness of rape cannot be explained by its infringement of our bodily autonomy consent rights because equally bodily/consent violating acts are not as bad as rape. For instance, most people have the intuition that if I non sexually shoved a tomato one inch into an unconscious person’s mouth without their consent, and the only way to stop me from continuing to do this for the next five minutes was by lethal force, you would be wrong to deploy lethal force to stop me, but if I did the same with my penis, lethal force is fair game (or at least severe punishment is fair game, putting me in the company of murderers). This shows that the special wrongness of rape is not a matter of bodily autonomy or consent rights, since the tomato example includes these features **without being as wrong or as bad as rape.** [people seem to not be reading this part carefully: I’m not saying it’s okay to forcefeed a tomato to someone, just that it isn’t as wrong as rape, even though both rape and forcefeeding equally transgress the bodily envelope and act without permission, which means we need an additional factor to account for our judgement that rape is worse, which I propose is the love view of sex.; **also, to clarify, the mouth is the point of ingress in both cases**]So: what explains the special wrongness of rape? I propose it’s that rape is made additionally wrong because sex is supposed to be an expression of love. If sex has no more value than eating a tomato, being purely a means for deriving pleasure, then rape is like forcing someone to eat a tomato. But rape is clearly much worse than that. So sex must be more morally significant than that.One implication of this view is that casual sex is immoral, because sex shouldn’t be practiced without love, and everything that entails: commitment, mutual understanding, etc.2. Argument 2: the same, but with pedophilia.Most people think (myself included) that pedophilia would be wrong even if the child were an eager participant and made no worse off by the experience in terms of utility. I propose that adult child sex is wrong because sex is supposed to be an expression of a rich loving relation between persons which requires a level of psychological maturity children do not possess: they don’t understand what the act of sex means or enter into a romantic relationship with the adult on anything resembling equal terms. We may try to explain the wrongness in terms of a consent violation, but children’s consent is violated all the time by their parents. For instance, mom and dad force little tommy to stay over with his strict aunt while they attend a wedding so that, among other things, the parents may have sexual intercourse. They know that Tommy will have a lower lifetime net utility as a result, but they don’t care. Even if you don’t think these parents have a right to do this, I seriously doubt you think it’s as wrong as raping their child. And yet they violated their child’s consent-regarding interests for the sake of sexual gratification with harmful net results for the child. So, consent violation cannot provide a complete explanation for the special wrongness of adult child encounters, whereas the view that sex must be an expression of mutual and informed love can.I will just mention here in closing that there is another factor which my love hypothesis explains which secular sexual liberalism doesn’t: the fact that people seem to often report that casual sex feels degrading, cheap, regrettable, unsatisfying, etc.",""
"217","cmv: the Willow project is good","Many have suggested that the Willow project is bad because it would increase climate change, however it is more nuanced than that. The willow project assists in avoiding dependence on foreign powers who have shown they are willing to support Russia and manipulate fuel prices for their own benefit. While there will be more supply of oil, it won’t mean that much more oil is used as petroleum is a rather demand inflexible product.  In the borough it affects most (North Slope) there is a majority consensus about that project (source: Nagruk Harcharek), and the drilling content has made proposals that are less likely to harm local Caribou. I also think we should look at what we are supporting if we don’t go forward with the project; right now there the deadliest conflict in europe since world war 2 happening, and we would be supporting the aggressor by supporting OPEC. People need and are going to get oil, how we do that is up to use.",""
"218","CMV: Light pollution isn’t something we should be worried about","I’ve recently seen a couple people online saying things such as “in a couple years we will struggle to see the stars from earth”. And while I can see their perspective, in that the night sky is pretty and fun to look at, changing urbanization shouldn’t halt for that alone. Another thing is that I’ve seen people complain that we will see more satellites than stars soon, but again that’s almost entirely an aesthetic problem. Satellites are made to for long distance communication and surveillance (which can be considered a different problem, not one I’ll discuss here) and I think it’s a net good for human progression. Again I don’t see a huge population of people saying light pollution is a huge problem, but I still think it’s a bit of a basic problem that we can largely ignore. That being said I don’t want to pollute the atmosphere with unnecessary satellites because they will only increase the risk for other satellites and orbital structures.Edit: all current replies are about the disturbance to circadian rhythm for animals around urban areas. From the two articles I’ve read the effects, while defiantly not ideal, are relatively minor: [National Geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/light-pollution/). This article also talks about how some cities are able to restore bird migration by encouraging more blue lights during migration season.Edit 2: upon closer consideration I think it is more of a problem than I originally thought. We obviously shouldn’t halt our growing urbanization (well not for this specifically at least), but there are other solutions we can use with relatively minor cost that will help the environment a decent amount.",""

It also doesn't help that sometimes, these victims family are furious that their loved ones death is a plot point in a production that they didn't even consent to, that retraumatizes them, and goes on to win awards and praise.

"220","CMV: Student loan debt forgiveness is a political game","I’m struggling with this as a politically left-leaning moderate, and hopefully-thoughtful person. Paid off private school debt years ago, with money earned from jobs I needed in order to whittle it down.Offering student loan forgiveness is a political move to win favor, because who *wants* their school debt? It’s much easier to frame it as an injustice and crippling financial burden, and prevalent enough that it’ll win votes from an increasingly squeezed, college-educated middle class.I understand that student debt can be a massive burden and limit a person’s freedom to follow their interests—instead having to focus on grinding out earnings to pay down this enormous thing. In every single case, however, the person chose to incur the debt. A college education is not required to be financially successful, and nobody woke up one day with a lump of student loan debt they never agreed to take on.I understand that I am biased, because I paid mine off and I’m naturally inclined to be jealous or dismissive of someone that may not have to pay off theirs. Having to deal with the debt shaped how I spent my time during and immediately after college, constantly having some source of income that’d let me eat and live indoors while working down an uncomfortably large balance. I also entered a more welcoming and opportunity-filled job market than many that followed.But shouldn’t we deal with the consequences of our actions? This is not one of those murky areas where we’re limited by genetics, race, or other factors over which we have no control.In the U.S. a person probably needs a car to do basic things like buy groceries and get to work. Does that mean that auto loan forgiveness is coming next? People need to live somewhere and houses can be stupidly expensive—disproportionately to living wages in some places. Are mortgages an injustice to be toppled and wiped clean?These things seem like a big score with people that would like to shed responsibility they explicitly took on, at the expense of the business or organization that offered the product. (And at the expense of the debtor, if you buy into the theory that the loan motivates financial discipline.)This is more populism, not a prudent and sustainable way of improving peoples’ lives. It’s trading responsibility for votes and letting someone else handle the bill.",""
"221","CMV: Feminism combined with capitalist values is systemically antithetical to the continued existence of the human race in the face of industrialized society","To be clear from the outset I would consider myself a feminist. Ensuring the rights of women that have been gained is critical and pushing for more strides is needed. I am also sympathetic to antinatalist thought so the discontinuation of births is not really a crisis for me beyond its potential economic implications. However, it has occurred to me over the recent discourse about birth rates that if we take the facts that: 1) Liberated women generally enter the workforce. 2)Entering the workforce generally requires interaction with the demands of capital.  3) Success in capital generally requires the internalization of capitalist ideology. 4) Capitalist analysis under industrial or “developed” material conditions generally paints children as a net negative to the parents interests under the ideology of capital. 5) People generally act within what they perceive to be in their interest.Therefore: The introduction of feminist thought into developed society will lead to birth rates falling below replacement. When all genders are in the workforce child rearing become a societal afterthought. This is corroborated from everything I’ve seen out of the parts of the developed world I keep an eye on (mainly the Anglo-sphere, Europe, and China, Korea, and Japan in intensity of tabs keeping in that order). TLDR; Would love to have my mind changed on feminism combined with the ideology of capital being incompatible with continued human existence.",""

The US should do something similar. Misinformation is a huge problem, and people with high follower counts can be perceived as trustworthy sources when they can just as easily be lying about their credentials or education.**Social media should have a system for verifying a persons' qualifications and making them prominent, so you can see if a person giving medical advice is actually qualified to talk about this.** I think this would visually be similar to Twitter's verification check mark. A user submits their qualifications, things like degrees or professional licenses, into an internal system.  The only information that is revealed to the public is the qualification.   This would be a voluntary decision if you want the qualification to be visible.If the system was enacted, I think it should start with just subjects like medicine or  finance that have a higher risk of harm caused by misinformation. To clarify, I do not think the focus should be on content moderation. Its not about prohibiting people from talking about certain things, its not about moderating what people are saying, its not about enacting a professional consensus on a subject. Its just a system so that you can see if your information is coming from a person with qualifications.Its not a perfect solution but I think it would help crack down on misinformation, especially among those who want their information coming from direct sources.

"223","CMV: Ukraine is not attacking civilian targets in Russia","This rarely makes it to the news on Reddit, but since the beginning of the “special military operation” Russia has been reporting numerous attacks on various targets inside Russia near the border, especially on Belgorod and Shebekino. In most cases the targets reported are civilian objects. From the reactions in pro-Western mass media it appears that a good portion of people believe that these attacks are carried out by Ukraine. I don't think this is so, because:* While most of the time the attacks are said to be carried out by Grads (not-so-precise multiple rocket launchers), quite a few reports mentioned HIMARS and other precision artillery. Makes no sense to waste these targeting private houses.* It seems that it would be feasible to cover the most targeted areas with anti missile defense systems, or *something*, but I don't see anything being done.* Most importantly, there's no point in attacking civilian targets. This is not a show of power since Ukraine is not advertising or even admitting the attacks in any way, and the opinion that the attacks serve as a means of intimidation is hard to take seriously.Now, it's fair to ask, if not Ukraine, who is bombing Russia? Well, it's hard to say what exactly is going on given the one-sidedness of the reports. But these attacks serve as a major point of internal propaganda. I've heard opinions like, “I had no opinion about the war until they started attacking us... When they started bombing Belgorod they became our enemy”. So it would make sense for Russia to stage the attacks on its own territory, but maybe not even that would be necessary. What you need is not actual explosions or casualties, but pictures of destruction, butterfly mine sightings and perhaps loud bangs.",""

"225","CMV: The idea of a world ""peace"" is more terrifying than nuclear war ever could be.","Let's be honest, no one (at least not in my opinion) wants 'world peace'.  It's a forced buzzword that people say to gain instant 'mhm, yes'.  Like saying 'me like long walks by beach'.  It's a cliche.World ""peace"", to me in reality, is TERRIFYING.  A government able to fully immerse itself in its own land now has the ability to focus on ways to control its populace.  A society not distracted by war now has more time to innovate and create technology, which governments will use to gain control.  Governments can't control if they're distracted by nuclear war.  They are too busy to enforce zoning laws.  They are too busy to enforce drug laws.  And they are too busy to find ways to tax people.  They cannot allocate resources to give local authorities more equipment to assert authority.  Every country worldwide, not distracted by nuclear war, not needing resources to fight, uses those resources inward.As bad as it sounds, war is a necessary horror that distracts governments.  They can't do EVERYTHING, they have to allocate resources.  The more nuclear explosions, the less resources governments can use.Peace, ideally, would be a world where everyone is positive and doesn't create these evil laws or use technology to enforce laws.But because humans are parasites (I use this term technically and not like a 1990s edgelord, because, let's face it, we DO act like parasites on a global scale), we choose to ruin things.  Nuclear war makes this slightly more difficult due to the fact that we now have less equipment to do this.Of course, this is a conclusion I've come to and I really don't like it, which is why I'm looking for a view change.  But I am terrified of a world where the government and people innovate and create new ways to control and screw over my life.  I feel like nuclear war would solve that problem (I am PERFECTLY fine dying in it, I either die instantly or I get to enjoy a few months of traveling and then die a rather painful and horrific death, but a death I understood nonetheless.).  Maybe I'm just a very messed up selective pessimist for what most people see as a positive, and a very messed up selective optimist for what most people see as a negative.

"226","CMV: Corporations support the LGBT for money, not love.","Corporations do not support the LGBT community out of love. They support the community because it brings in money/customers, or retains customers. I am specifically talking about corporations and not local businesses or mom and pop stores. Everything a corporation does must be for the benefit of its shareholders and that practically always means “make more money.” Society and media has decided that LGBT representation is of great importance. Any company not showing support for the LGBT community is at a great disadvantage, because the customers will stop supporting the company. If society decided tomorrow that sacrificing goats is a good thing, you best believe Apple is going to buy some goat farms. Companies in all sectors show much support to the LGBT community. They often boast about their percent of staff that is LGBT, hire LGBT people, and change their twitter profile to a rainbow once a year. There is even a metric for companies: ESG, environmental, social, governance. Investors can choose what companies’ stock to invest in by comparing how a company is governed and one of the ways to get a better score under Governance is “Composition of the board in terms of diversity & independence”. It does not feel like a leap to suggest that LGBT candidates are not hired/promoted due to merit, rather they are hired to fill a quota. You ever notice how companies showing support for the LGBT communities in America have a neutral or no stance on the matter in countries where the LGBT community is not popular? That is because those corporations would lose money and customers for supporting such ideas. Do not think corporations actually care about the LGBT community, or any specific social issue for that matter. The bottom line for the vast majority of corporations is: If it makes more money, do it. Nothing else really matters.Edit: View Changed! The insincere support of companies still leads to more, real support for the LGBT due to the response of the individuals in society. Also, There are non profit corporations that are made by the LGBT for the LGBT community.",""
"227","CMV: there is nothing morally wrong with consensual necrophilia.","Obviously when I am talking about consent here it is not in the idea of asking the person after they are dead if they can have sex but rather the person signing some legal document before death to allow sex (or any other activity they allow) to happen to their body. I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies even after death. I dont really see it as mattering to family members not involved in the agreement as it is similar to Muslims and cremation. Some people in the family could be against it(cremation), but it was not their wishes so it does not matter. This doesn't necessarily have to stop at just necrophilia either, if the person wanted to be eaten, or dismembered those should still be allowed, as long as they consented to it before death. In terms of legality I do think it should be allowed but I see there being a hard time allowing that to happen due to the fights that already happen over family deaths, So I would be willing to settle for it is okay morally but can never happen legally.",""

You can do everything right and then a life changing incident can hit you out of nowhere: like the death of a loved one and it’ll completely break you. You cannot in such a situation be happy. Also being happy for a prolonged period can also make you complacent. Pain and struggle in life is inevitable and to some extent even necessary for growth. Then I also thought that the purpose of life is to be a good person but the more I looked into it, the more I realised how subjective the idea of good/bad is.

Yet, today's pornography industry can only be as big and as permanent as it is because billions of people help to keep it alive:Billions of people watch porn, hundreds of thousands make porn, a lot of people pay for porn and, besides that, there is a very large number of people and industries providing the modern pornography industry the infrastructure it needs so that anyone with a smartphone anywhere can watch high-quality porn with minimum loading screens and a gigantic variety of content and tools to lead you to the videos you wanna see.This isn't about billions of people deeply fighting their urges to please God and failing.

However, most people say they follow one of the major world religions, and pretty much all of us discover the concept of God by being taught in some of these religions. Then, what these people do is strip this religion of all its set rules and interpret it in a way that allows them to do whatever they feel like without feeling guilty.But that isn't coherent with believing that an omnipotent God created the world and sent a divine book. If you really believed there was a fucking omnipotent God creating rules you wouldn't read his/ her rule book with such vast interpretative freedom, for you would be fearing a freaking omnipotent being that could torment you to eternity.Besides that, all the Western world is secular.

Having a justice with this perspective ensures these voices in the country are represented. Today, though, the court is almost entirely partisan and votes rarely change. Instead, justices practically ignore oral arguments, precedent, and their duty and instead try to force through their personal vision of what the law should be (i.e., they legislate from the bench). Based on what we saw with Justice Thomas and his wife, it is also somewhat corrupt and untrustworthy (I somehow doubt Thomas and his wife are the only ones engaging in this behavior, they're just the ones that got caught). We should do away with the pretense that the court cares about oral arguments and just skip that alltogether, so we can get to the point where they inevitably vote along party lines.",""
"237","CMV: I shouldn't have to respect or thank the military at all."," I  used to be a pretty conservative person that believed that one should   always have respect for police and military personnel but 20 years of  the War on Terror brought me to adopt some pretty pacifistic beliefs.So   why should I respect military personnel for participating in something  I  don't believe in? I'm sure someone is going to bring up the current  war  in Ukraine so I will say that directly defending one's own country  from  a foreign invader or neighboring invader is one of the few  scenarios in  which I believe armed conflict is justified.I'm   American so I'm going to use the War on Terror as my main example. Why   should I respect someone who occupies foreign soil for an indefinite   amount of time with no clear exit strategy? Why should I respect a drone   pilot who mows down civilians based on bad intel? Why should I respect   someone who levels a building full of unarmed people or hostages? Why  do  I owe a debt of gratitude toward anyone who willingly participates  in  what I feel is an unjust military-industrial complex?A   common argument I've heard is that I should blame politicians and   leaders instead of military personnel and soldiers who don't have a   choice in the matter. I do very much blame politicians and there aren't   many options to vote for who have a genuine anti-war platform. In fact,   I've gotten very cynical about politics in general and feel that the   majority of politicians are careerists who only care about amassing   wealth. But military personnel are beholden to such politicians up to   the point that the president is considered the commander-in-chief. I   don't care who is sitting in the the White House, be they Bush, Obama,   Biden, or Trump, I don't owe them a duty of respect and they certainly   aren't my commander-in-chief.Also,   a common argument I've heard is that military personnel hate war and   neverending conflicts. Then why do you keep participating? Why does the   military hate whisteblowers? Why is it always whistleblowers and  leakers  who are punished instead of warmongering politicians? Why do we  reward  people like Donald Rumsfeld and Henry Kissinger and punish  people like  Edward Snowden and Bradley/Chelsea Manning?EDIT/UPDATE: So you guys got me to think along about the humanitarian and charity work the military does as well as search and rescue. I am grateful for that and understand that many people don't have a lot of options outside the military. However, I'm never going to support torture, black sites, or drone attacks. And there's still a part of me that feels that military personnel are pawns of men like Kissinger.",""
"238","CMV: The ""Paradox of Tolerance"" is incorrectly understood and incorrectly explained in online sociopolitical debates in regards to American social issues such as LGBTQ+ rights.","**Trigger Warning:** >!Mentions of Violence, LGBTQ Rights, Politics, Pedophilia Mention!<**Disclaimer:** While I try to break apart and critique the use/reference of the *Paradox of Tolerance*. These critiques are not meant to make a statement (or be representative) of my personal views on the matter of LGBTQ+ or other civil rights movement(s). I won't bring that up here, but feel free to PM me.With this discussion I'm trying to leverage the on-paper ""Constitutional Rights"" of the United States versus the *Paradox of Tolerance* and how more often than not Popper's writings are sent to the front line of the discussion when the discussion involves the inclusion (/exclusion) with members of the LGBTQ community and their battle for national acceptance in the day-to-day sonder. Where as in most online sociopolitical debates I have observed Poppers writings are used incorrectly or not with a full understanding of the literature and the side arguing on behalf of the LGBTQ groups demonstrate the *Paradox of Tolerance* in the opposite manner in which it is intended.&#x200B;**Here is the full quote from Popper on the** ***Paradox of Tolerance*** **for reference:**>Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with  them.  >  >In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we an counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise.  >  >We should claim the *right* to suppress them if  necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not  prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by  denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to  rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer  arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.  >  >We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.&#x200B;**So we'll start off with my laundry list of issues with the** ***Paradox of Tolerance*** **and then I'll list my TL;DR point-by-point CMV items:*** What I feel is often missed is that second paragraph from Popper. It makes the *assumption* that the individual(s) stating the *Paradox of Tolerance* have a definitive reason to ""Fall-in"" to a shared sense of rationality, which I find to be self-defeating in a modern world as we segregate most of our online spaces curating them to our own unique likes and dislikes as well as our own unique sense of morality. Thus, rationality can *not* be a mediator as there is no need for the intolerant to communicate with the tolerant on a shared sense of rationality as they can always retreat to their own spaces or ""Echo Chambers"" as they have been dubbed making it so that ""Rationality"" can not be globally defined or accepted.* Again in the second paragraph here. It is acknowledged that suppression of intolerant philosophies strictly for the elimination of opposition is highly detrimental. The use of suppression should only come at the point in which rational discussion and approval via court of public opinion have failed. I find this section here to be severely mismanaged by those who would present this literature. Inherent suppression of speech or ideas without rational discussion and debate of the public court of opinion is within itself intolerant and what this thought experiment seeks to *PREVENT,* as suppression of ideology without rational discussion or public debate is tyranny.* There is no universally accepted definition of ""Morality"" on which to determine the side of the argument that is Tolerant vs. Intolerant. This is another area of Poppers theory where it becomes self-defeating IMO. It makes the *assumption* again that the public majority have a mutually agreed and conformed sense of morality on which to set a ""baseline"" for being Tolerant or Intolerant. Where-as morality is far less definitive and often shades of grey depending on culture, up-bringing, life experience..etc. This results in arguments where rational discussion can not even be had because each side will view themselves as inherently moral while viewing the other as immoral or ""Intolerant"".* There is (and very much should be) a limit to human tolerance of ideology and methodology. Now, of course that is *WAAAAAY* above my head to define where the line is. The problem with Popper's writing is not so much that it's a paradox but more like a repeating number. The ultimate baseline of tolerance will be decided by the public court of opinion, of which their position will change based on rational debate overtime. Any real ideology can use the *Paradox of Tolerance* no matter how immoral their ideology is. I will use ""Pedophilia"" as an example here as it's likely the one mutually agreed upon item in society we view collectively as ""Unacceptable."" Now, Pedophiles within their communities can argue they are oppressed and society is intolerant of them while they are the tolerant side. Ultimately, their position would remain ""True"" in the context of the *Paradox of Tolerance* as society is intolerant of them but I don't think anyone would defend that position given the nature of their ideology. All in all, there has to be a finite limit to what society will tolerate and  attempting to enforce ultimate tolerance on the public by use of suppression (violent or otherwise) will result in a complete breakdown of rationality within discussion and eventually, violent revolt. At what point does a tolerant ideology conflict at it's core with the morality of a society, and at that point do the oppressed have a right to attempt the suppression of an intolerant majority?* Jumping off from my last point there, let's discuss how this ideology conflicts with The United State's naturalized ""Rights"" as defined by the Constitution. So, most relevant here is the first Right granted:  ""*Freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition"".* While this is *specifically* to protect an individual or group against suppression by the government it does not apply to private citizens, corporations or non-actors of any Government agency. Now, sure the court of public opinion can certainly help ""De-platform"" those who have intolerant ideologies via corporate means but true suppression of the intolerant can not be done without force and that force can only come from a federal entity with the manpower to do so. In doing so however, it would have to violate that Constitutional Right which could not happen. Thus, the *Paradox of Intolerance* reaches a point in which suppression can only be achieved by violent actions on the public or the government ultimately causing the tolerant to become the intolerant.**Here is my point-by-point ""Change My View"" I'd like for you fine folk to weigh in on:**1. The *Paradox of Tolerance* is too poorly understood by those whom would quote it to apply it to a situation rationally. More over, when the issue at hand is one of subjective morality and not of objective right/wrong.2. As morality is anything but definitive. Both sides will view each other as the ""Intolerant"" and attempt to lobby the court of public opinion for suppression right away, this will however result in extremism from both sides of the aisle. Being that a difference in morality will prevent the point in which rational discussion can be had, suppression without rational discussion causes both sides to be Intolerant not just to their ideology but also to mere *idea* of rational discussion with the opposing side.3. American sociopolitical online debates critically misuse the *Paradox of Intolerance.* As suppression or ""Cancel Culture"" as it has been dubbed is often utilized first prior to any sort of rational discussion or attempt to rational discussion. When done too fast or without visible rational public debate it results in a loss of support for the oppressed group in the court of public opinion and in some cases even fosters resentment or revolt from the public majority neutral. (See: Hogwarts Legacy video game drama for an example of this.)4. The *Paradox of Tolerance* at it's core is advocating ***not*** for complete destruction of intolerant ideology through strict means of violence or suppression, but through rational discussion on the lens of public majority accepted morality. Thus, members of the LGBTQ+ community engaging in online debate while incorrectly utilizing/understanding the aforementioned core end up causing a detrimental effect to their movement by not allowing for rational discussion, overall being a net negative to the advancement of their position within public opinion.5. I will lastly bring up another popular concept in online debate being the ""Slippery Slope"" which is another theory that is often misused as a fallacy. It is only a fallacy however when the individual making the argument can not objectively demonstrate that ""Action A"" led to ""Destination B"". The *Paradox of Tolerance* ironically is what demonstrates how a ""Slippery Slope"" can in fact be true. If a society must be ultimately tolerant in order to rid intolerance than each action of resistance to intolerance can be plotted, ultimately creating a slope that continues to descend with no definitive plateau. This is overall not a positive outcome for society as a whole were it to be adopted in such a manner as tolerant is not equal to being moral.**Thank you! Feel free to poke at my analysis of Popper's writings as well, but those 5 above were the key points I could muster.****Edit:** Little dead now, I need to head to sleep but thank you all so much for your contributions, I enjoy discussing things along this subject matter as it really does wind the ole noggin up.

"241","CMV: Finding love on an online dating site can never be truly special and romantic","A big part of Romance is making the bond and connection feel special.

There's also bonus excitement when love is found in an unexpected place or when you're not looking for it. In short, finding a partner has been a special experience for thousands and thousands of years. Online dating is not the authentic human experience of finding love. The fact that you are on the site implies that you are lonely and actively looking for someone to fill that role. How special can it be when you finally settle on one? Did they meet the bare minimum needs? Are you glad that you have someone instead of no one now?It also kind of implies that you don't have a lot of real life pursuers as well. If you had 10 to 12 people pursuing you that you had met from work, hobbies, life, and school... Well that's a lot to manage. You're sorting through them seeing what you like and don't like, the last thing you're doing is adding to the list by finding another five candidates online.Having a lot of real life pursuers is also part of what makes a relationship special. I had these 12 people but I chose YOU. Not ,"" I had zero options but I chose you."" These are the implications of online dating. I understand people are busy and not everybody has time to meet their match in an art gallery in Italy, or some movie-esque romantic encounter. I think online dating should be saved for short-term flings because of this inherent lack of romance. I'm open to hearing anecdotes about special online connections, that are truly romantic. I know plenty of people who are happily married from finding an online partner, but I still think it's weird and unauthentic.",""

"243","cmv: The idea that it is ‘traditional’ that men worked and women stayed at home is a right wing fantasy."," For some reason Instagram thinks I have unresolved issues with my mother and has inundated me with nonsensical whiny propaganda regurgitated by fresh and fit and that genius pearl. And an overriding theme that seems to emanate from their effluence is that women historically stayed at home and photosynthesised while their brave husband went outside empire building or some other rubbish, and that they should go back to being at home and be 'traditional'. I'm going to call this don Quixote syndrome, men with hilarious views on manliness and chivalry tilting at imaginary foes that 'threaten' their precious masculinity.  But let me tell you a couple of three things, first of all the notion that women historically never worked, and that men were the primary breadwinners in society. This is a modern myth and fantasy completely divorced from reality. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS WORKED. Women have for the entirety of the history been engaged in labour and work. In pre industrial agrarian societies both men, women and children were engaged in farming. Subsistence farming without industrial tools is incredibly manpower intensive and the idea you have half the adult population exclusively at home is ridiculous. You can see this even to this day in less developed economies, tea pickers, and hell visit any village in India you will find just as many women in the fields as men, it is literally necessary for survival, particularly in rice growing societies that women also engage in field labour. Now you could say that men did more field work than women in general, ok fine, but that does not denigrate the very real and important labour that women did do to a far greater extent than men. Textiles, spinning and knitting, the clothes on most of humanities backs were manufactured by women, how could a man wield a scythe in summer if his wife didn't the clothes that kept him from freezing in winter?? But moving on from that into the industrial age, literally the very first workers in the new burgeoning factories were women! They worked the spinning jennies, women were at the forefront in the new sectors that opened up in the industrial revolution. The coal mines had entire families working in them, mum, dad , and the kids, not just the men. Gruelling labour that women got paid less than the men for, the children a mere pittance. Women had to work, to bring home money or the entire family would starve, for 99% of people for 99% of history, the mans wages were simply not enough.  I believe this idea that women are meant to stay at home and only raise kids and do housework really originated with the rise of the middle class. With a tranche of society where men had the luxury of being able to financially take care of multiple dependants. Thanks to this for a few decades, particularly in post WW2 America there was a time where the economic circumstances allowed the culture of a stay at home wife to become prevalent. But moving on to this other notion that men in the past were all brave heroic adventurers who went of brave overseas conquests. Again another fantasy, sure apart from the maybe few thousand kings and upper nobility that existed in societies for the other 100 billion humans that have existed it was a daily battle for survival. You were tied to your land, your status little more than a slave, unless of course you were a slave. You couldn't read or write, you couldn't leave your land without the lords permission, you'd most likely be pressed into service so your master could gain another bit of land, and if you survived you'd go home a cripple. And the idea that any of you if you were born during the past somehow break free and rise is laughable, social mobility was extremely rare, you try that alpha male andrew tate sigma nonsense as a peasant you'll get your head lopped off by a knight in a heartbeat. While maybe men had it slightly better of than women their position was still pitiable. So you know what if everyone should be traditional then 99% of men should be subservient, and die at aged thirty after getting sepsis from a papercut.",""
"244","CMV: The US President should regain Line-item veto over every legislation, a power lost in 1998.",">Forty-four of the 50 U.S. states give their governors some form of line-item veto power, and U.S Presidents have been asking congress for such power for decades. Until 1996, when Clinton received it for two years. Shortly after, a 6–3 decision from SCOTUS found ""Line-item veto"" unconstitutional.Considering that SCOTUS has made wrong calls before, I am siding with the three judges who disagreed with removing this power. I believe that the President of the Republic should have the exclusive powers to veto bills, either in whole or in part. And that any provisions vetoed in such a manner are returned to congress and can be overridden by a vote.* Edit 2: **The reason for this idea come from stopping poison pills from being inserted into bills, forcing congress or the president to kill the whole thing**. This gives the president the power to remove bad sections put in the bills by either malice or stupidity.* If this is not overturned first by a future SCOTUS, an amendment would allow this veto power to return. Regardless of how likely this is to happen; I believe this would prevent bills from being full of ""pork"".Here is my proposal:1. A veto may be political, when the matter is considered contrary to the public interest; or legal, if understood as unconstitutional.2. As for the scope, it can be total or partial, and in the latter case it must cover the full text of an article, paragraph, item or subparagraph. That is, ""words or periods are not subject to a line-item-veto"".3. The President has fifteen working days to veto a text. After the publication of a veto, Congress triggers the constitutional period of 30 calendar days for the senators and house members to decide on the veto.4. A **4/7 of the votes** of both House members and Senators is needed for the veto to be overridden. Less than a super majority, more than a simple majority\*\**Edit 1: This used to read ""absolute majority or 2/3"". As this has been the bulk of the comments, I will adjust the matter to simple majority. This should fix the issues.**Edit 3: I still support the provision, but some claim that simple majority is now too lenient. Maybe the magic number lies in the middle. 4/7s of each chamber means that you need more than a simple majority, but less than an absolute majority.*",""

And I guess this is not new since I’ve come to learn even ancient philosophies are pretty defined by their answering how to live a happy life.Personally, I find this bemusing. Happiness is an unquantifiable emotional state which makes it a horrible metric to base one’s life decisions on. It’s too vague, precarious and unproductive to be a goal worth achieving. At best it should be seen as a by product of other endeavors, but not a goal in itself.People should base their major choices and goals on being productive or simply attaining virtues. These are much better goals because they are measurable and quantifiable. Being a productive worker, citizen, family man, role model, etc… any of these are superior to happiness.Therefore, my view is that happiness isn’t really a good goal or purpose to life and people drop it.

""I want a girl that hot (but who isn't a pornstar) to desire me"" or even ""I want to have so much cash that I could hire all these pornstars for a party in my yacht!"".So pornography could motivate you to get active, to study, to work harder, to get creative, to become smarter (as it is an attractive trait), to become emotionally stable (as it is an attractive trait), etc.Because you're not gonna fuck a 9/10 by being a lazy poor couch potato with no friends.So, if you see pornography and instead of feeling motivated you feel like a loser and without strength to do anything, maybe that is on you.",""

"251","CMV: The Letter Grading System in colleges should be replaced with the Raw Percentage Grade, at least when calculating the GPA.","A few problems with Letter Grading:1. It gives students labels and those who received an F would face heavier stigma than those who recieving a ""59"" for example, because F directly means ""failure"".2. The intervals are sometimes too wide. In Japan it's often as wide as 10 points. So Letter grading leads to students calculating how many points they need to cross the cutting point. Some people who can have a good estimate of their score and know their mid-exam scores would think like ""I'm gonna recieve a B no matter what, if I study it's 88, if I don't it's 82, so better recieve the 82 and slack"" and slack instead of study. When I was in the 1st and 2nd grade of college, I was a great score controller and recieved a great deal of 91s, 92s and 86s. (90 and 85 were cutting points in my college but in some Japanese ones there are only 90/80/70/60, a 89 and a 80 would be the same), slacked in courses I knew I would receive a 90+ (and an A/A-, both 4.0 GPA) and somewhat gave up on those I know I would only get a B+ or B (3.6/3.3). 3. It can sometimes make bad students look good. In my case I have a fairly high GPA but the vast majority of my 4.0s are made up of 92. So students who receive 97s and 100s in some courses and 78s in others may seem worse than me, but there is a HUGE I mean Huge gap between 92 and 100. It's simply unfair for the more ""unbalanced"" students. 4. Similarly it can make good students look bad. Not only the unbalanced ones but also the unlucky ones who would recieve a 89 or 79 or whatever-9 in many courses. 5. Letter grading has lost its original meaning because of grade inflation. B no longer means ""good"", it's ""barely acceptable"" for many. On the other hands, in some specific conditions (such as a course with a very low median score), a C might mean ""super good"". 6. In cases where curve grading or adjustment of scores is needed, teachers can just adjust the raw percentage without having to care about the cutoff lines for grades, saving a lot of additional work and potential 89/79/69 pointers pleaing to the teacher.7.

I say ""from a social justice perspective"" because it may be beneficial from a commercial perspective for the IP owners to do this, to avoid the books getting criticised by certain groups.For physical attributes, the following text from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (note: I'm going on the Twitter thread of [Incunabula](https://twitter.com/incunabula/status/1626860237104857089) as The Telegraph article is paywalled)>A nine-year-old boy who was so enormously fat he looked as though he had been blown up with a powerful pumphad been changed to>A nine-year-old boy who was so enormous he looked as though he had been blown up with a powerful pumpwhich doesn't meaningfully change the nature of Augustus Gloop. In fairness, I don't know how to re-write him in a way that would satisfy everybody - would we have to get rid of him, and if so, what about the other horrible children competing against Charlie? At that stage, we'd be keeping the legs of the Chippendale commode while chopping the rest of it up for firewood.For race, the text in the same book>""You mean Prince Pondicherry?"" said Grandpa Joe, and he began chuckling with laughter. ""Completely dotty"", said Grandpa George, ""But very rich,"" said Grandma Georginato>""You mean Prince Pudacherry?"" said Grandpa Joe, and he began chuckling with laughterStill has the former colony of India exoticised.There are also removals of colours even when it doesn't talk about race, such as removing from ""Fantastic Mr Fox"" the phrase ""the machines were both black"". This is a rather severe case of worrying about words but not their meaning.For sex/gender, they changed>She had a screeching voiceto>She had an annoying voicewhich is still gendered.Getting rid of cashiers or secretaries in ""The Witches"" in favour of top scientists or running a business does change the meaning of the text, but feels like an airbrushing of not just history but also the present.I don't know whether Dahl had the foggiest idea about GLBT issues, but changing in ""James and the Giant Peach"">queer ramshackle houseto>strange ramshackle househas the assumption that if ""queer"" is used for GLBT issues, it is no longer practical for it to be used for any other purposes, and changing in ""The Witches"">""Don't be foolish,"" my grandmother said.

""Besides, there are plenty of other reasons why women might wear wigs and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.""is rather cringeworthy for a Seinfeld-esque ""nothing wrong with that"", while the original is a far more stark admonishment for would-be witch-hunters, or modern day equivalents.To pre-empt some comments. Yes, he has made some comments outside of his books which are not merely anti-Israel but are shockingly anti-semitic. I was saddened when, at an age that I'd already stopped reading his books, I found out about this. However, that doesn't mean that these specific edits are justified, or that they reduce the amount of anti-semitism in his books. And yes, Dahl originally had the Oompa Loompas as pygmies from Africa and he changed them during his lifetime to being fantasy creatures. But that was a change of meaning, to avoid one race of human beings being serfs to a person of another race, not just replacing specific words. And yes, Penguin has claimed that they will publish the ""classic"", pre-2022 versions as well, and publishers in other languages have stated they won't be making these edits.Change my view.",""

Also, I speak from the point of view of a  multicultural North American city though I believe this happens to different degrees in all cities. Since we are all different, there will always be people who cannot function in society no matter how much support is given. Whether it's because of their mental state, their personality, their social support, etc.There will be people who struggle because they don't understand society and can't/won't learn how (for whatever reason). It's unrealistic to expect everyone to be able to engage in society. It's futile to try to ""get rid"" of homelessness. There should be a certain level of ""expected"" homelessness, and support programs could be monitored for diminishing returns.

"254","CMV: Drugs should remain banned in countries with little or no drug problem, such as China or Japan","Edi: I'm talking about recreational not medical drugs. Medical drugs should be legalized.  The US and the West only legalised some soft drugs like Marijuana because they could not ban them effectively. They lost their War on Drugs. However, in China or Japan where almost no one does drugs, suddenly legalising them would artificially create a whole drug problem for us to deal with. So why not just keep them banned and avoid the trouble of having to deal with a big drug-influenced population? We don't have a big drug problem anyways. I live in China. I have never known anyone who consumes, possesses or sells illegal drugs in real life. The proportion of drug users in the worst drug-influenced province, Yunnan, is below 1%. According to the government, ""As of the end of 2021, there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide with a year-on-year decrease of 17.5%, 3.4 million people who didn't relapse for more than three years after withdrawal, an increase of 13.4% year-on-year"".

"255","cmv: The believe in women needed to be covered in islam stems of misogyny","I must first clarify that I do consider the culture and religion of Islam to be more cult like in structure and enforcement , I also hold this belief towards Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses, etc. I have never once heard an argument as to why Muslim people believe their prophet and god orders modesty from women and very little on men. Whenever I ask this question I get a "" because he said so"" response. I think this is an obvious cop out response because they have no other arguments, why does one think the human body of a female should be hidden more than a  man. they're different kinds of veils however none of which would be used for a man as regardless to which one the male would have more skin/hair exposed. Women also will lust at the sight of men so they should be veiled as well but they are not. I think the idea of this is because women are supposed to be less sex driven than men and as a hyper sexual female I know very well this isn't true. Also I don't believe there is a state of modesty that doesn't involve other people as the concept of modesty is a social construct in itself, so the woman is not doing it for herself if she believes it's from her religion. Not even going to mention how modesty has nothing to do with preventing rape as many people will use as a reason. A person who wishes to take someone's will and control them will simply not be warded off by clothes. In addition to all of the previous statements having loose articles of clothing such as a full body veil is very dangerous and restricting as I see women covered in swimming pools or on rollercoasters. Amusement park workers are too afraid of being accused as Islamophobic than prioritizing their safety as clearly stated on most amusement park rides. The pools also include dangerous parts which could suck a woman in by her veil and not release allowing her to drown. I really am searching for a response from a person who veils or knows people who veil under the islamic religion. I am damn near begging for someone to inform me on this topic.",""

That most of these administrators have useless jobs which could be eliminated without any negative effect.Even if we do need more administrators proportionally to the past to enforce certain new ""good"" rules, the sheer growth *seems* unjustifiable.So what are they doing all day?My guess would be they are creating and enforcing meaningless procedures, engaged in repetitive meetings, and the like.Sure, there are important things we need administrators for, my point is that most of what they do now isn't important.*Point here is to avoid semantics:* My point doesn't imply that most administrators do nothing useful. It could be that for the average administrator 25% of their work is necessary, and that only 5% do absolutely zero useful work. This wouldn't disprove my point that less (likely far less than 50%) of administrators are de facto useless/unnecessary.I haven't heard any argument justifying this so-called ""administrative bloat"" but considering hundreds of thousands if not millions of people work in these type of jobs and environment and there seems to be no meaningful political effort to reduce the number of administrators out there; there must be some sort of justification, and I am curious to see what that is and see if it changes my view :)",""

I believe BSC doesn't support the true image of what a public blockchain is. For starters, BSC is heavily centralized, its validators network is only comprised of the 21 top holders of BNB and updated daily. Some other blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, avalanche and others have more than 40k validators globally.Second, BSC's ecosystem is lesser developed than other blockchain ecosystem's such as Ethereum and Polygon. Infrastructure tools and backing is essential to fostering connections and partnerships within the web3 ecosystem. When you look at DeFillama, the top projects on BSC are meaningless (this is my opinion): you got Pancake Swap that holds over 50% of the TVL in BSC (they have 2.8B whereas the total value locked in BSC is 4.4b.Third, having gone to various crypto events, I have always felt a seperation between Binance native crypto projects and other decentralized protocols such as Ethereum/polygon/avalanche... Binance for me has a great backing but experiments little with pushing the limits of innovation and testing out new features. Every new product added to their platform has been a fork of DeFi product (Binance Earn, Binance Staking...). Projects being native in Binance don't look to push the limits rather they want to benefit from the huge backing Binance has and its connections.Lastly, the image projects have when deploying on decentralized protocols is enhanced compared to the one that would be of deploying on a centralized protocol. Nobody (IMHO) wants to associated with centralisation rather they want to show that they are building new things, taking part in partnerships with other decentralized protocols.I am currently in a debate with my CEO and am building a case on why not Binance Smart Chain and more Polygon.

"260","CMV: In the People vs AI Debates, Many People Put Human Creativity Up on a Pedestal that is not Warranted","So couple of caveats before I get started.  In this context, I define creativity as the following:  capability of coming up with novel ideas that are useful.  Now, this doesn't capture all of creativity but I think it is a good working definition.  Accordingly, you can come up with novel ideas that are not useful (e.g. we should stack TVs in front of windows to block out the sun from entering our room) and unoriginal ideas that are useful (e.g. same variant of existing business ideas) but none of them are creative. A second caveat.  For this CMV, I am arguing against people who think that the AI models will never touch human creativity. Third caveat.  I am only interested in the final outcome and not anything certain aspects of creativity that are unique to humans (e.g. emotions, intuitions).  Because if the argument is that these factors such as emotions and intuitions need to be present for there to be creativity, then we just have a different definition of what being creativity is.  In this CMV, I am only concerned about whether or not an AI model can come up with ideas that can be used to propel and progress society.  The black box of how this occurs are vastly different from the human mind to the AI model but I am only concerned with results for this CMV. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_I think a common mistake that people make when it comes to creativity is to think that most creativity comes from extrapolative thought process whereas I think most creativity comes from interpolative process.  An example is needed.  Product A has certain strengths and weaknesses. Product B has certain strengths that can compensate for Product A's weakness.  If you combine Product A and Product B, you retain Product A's strengths while removing its previous weaknesses (due to Product B).   This is interpolation.  Many of the creative ideas come from combining existing products/concepts to obtain some sort of synergy.  And I would call this interpolative construction as opposed to extrapolative construction.  This occurs not only in products but also in science.  Most of the creative scientific publications come from integrating different concepts together in an original way that spawns out new concepts/results.  It is taking existing concepts and linking them together, which is interpolation. Now to contrast this, perhaps this is an example of extrapolative creativity.  When Wagner first composed Tristan and Isolde, the Tristan chord was deemed to be ""odd"" as to the best of our knowledge, this type of chord and progression was never used in any other musical piece before.  So I think this is extrapolative creativity.  But I would argue that these type of genius creativity is very rare amongst human achievements as most creativity is shuffling around existing components in a synergistic manner.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_So why is this interpolative/extrapolative stuff important?  Because it turns out that the current deep learning models are very good at interpolation but not as good at extrapolation.  So if most of human creativity are extrapolative, yes, I would argue that ML models still have a long way to go before touching human creativity.  But that isn't the case as I would argue that most human creativity are interpolative. And this is something that ML models can handle very well. If you look at any medium, scientific journals/publications provide a large dataset of human creativity.  A typical publication has list of references.  And by using these references, the authors come up with novel ways to advance science.  In essence, if you mix and match the important concepts/keywords from these references, you can come up with that new paper.  And this is the type of structures that are very suitable for Large Language Models where keywords/concepts can be viewed as nodes and being present in the same publication can be viewed as connections between these nodes.  Basically, a novel, creative idea in science can be boiled down to unique/useful connections between the pre-existing nodes.  This type of abstraction (nodes/edges) and discovery of new scientific ideas is something that has been occurring a lot in recent ML papers.  There are couple of problems though.  (1) The current ML models just brute-force its way through generating all possible combinations of concepts/ideas that there is too much junk that is being created.  (2) The current ML models need human input to decide upon the objective function in the first place.   And I would argue that in the next 5 years or so, problem (1) will be solved once more data are collected and the objective function becomes more details (such that only a few ideas that are creative remain in the filter).  (2) is something that won't be fixed for a long time since people need to provide the objective function (the AI model cannot suddenly decide it is interested in inventing a better cell phone).  But regardless, I don't think that is what the critics are saying when they say that AIs cannot be creative. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_TLDR:  Many AI models will demonstrate creativity in a very short period of time and become better than people at coming up with useful ideas.  The main reason is that creative processes are mostly interpolative and the current AIs are very good at interpolation.  As such, it is a fallacy to think that human creativity is something that cannot be touched by these models.",""

"263","CMV: The origin of COVID-19 is uncertain","I think people are reflexively against the lab-leak hypothesis because it seems more conspiratorial, but are too over-confident in dismissing it. People need to take a Bayesian approach to this question. The origin of COVID-19 was three years ago, and subject to two layers of coverups - once by local Wuhan officials hiding their failures in Dec 2019, and then later by the Chinese central government. To summarize US government agency positions from this [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-origin-china-lab-leak-807b7b0a): FBI thinks lab leak w/ ""moderate confidence""DOE thinks lab leak w/ ""low confidence""CIA and another Unnamed agency is undecided between two theoriesNational Intelligence Council + four unnamed agencies thinks animal transmission w/ ""low confidence""The agencies at most moderately confident and they are split. In terms of publicly available information:In favor of animal transmission:* Animal transmission is historically where all diseases came from In favor of lab leak:* There is a lab in Wuhan where it could have come from, and they were working in the area of coronaviruses* There have been many cases of [lab leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laboratory_biosecurity_incidents) in the past (and since!)* Labs are a new invention compared to the entire history of human-animal interactions, so history isn't the best judge* There has yet to be a clearly established animal link unlike other novel diseases (like SARS or MERS)*  The disease predates the outbreak at the [wet market](https://www.science.org/content/article/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally), weakening the animal leak. Notice how the arguments in favor of lab leak are mostly rebuttals to the idea that it is definitely animal transmission, but aren't definitive themselves either. The Chinese government suppressed scientists trying to raise the alarm of covid existing. They've since resisted making investigation of the origin of COVID easy. I think they don't want any evidence of their initial poor handling (in December of 2019) of covid to come to light, or the possibility of a lab leak to come to light (I would guess they also don't know conclusively either). The coverup doesn't mean it is a lab leak - there are non-lab leak reasons for the Chinese coverup, it just means we can't know for sure. The information available to us as the public don't point definitely one way or another. The US government, which has experts and also spies etc also don't point definitely one way or another.

"264","CMV: As a furry myself, I think furry porn should be banned.","Furry porn is the butt of jokes by all non-furries, but most of you have no idea just how bad the situation is. I got into the fandom only a few years ago because of cute animals and because I like writing and worldbuilding, and I have already seen way too much. Before I was a furry I was like ""whatever, it's cringe but how much harm can it do?"" but now I genuinely think it needs to be banned. Full disclosure, I'm against all porn. You can read all about the rampant exploitation and outright sex assault that goes completely unpinished and even actively covered up, as well as its psychological effects, especially on children and teens (the world keeps ignoring that it's impossible to restrict something by age without outright banning it, but yes, this is your reminder that *very* young children watch porn, and countries that legalize it, even with heavy distribution restrictions like the UK and Russia, really *do* have a higher proportion of minors including preteens watching it than countries that outright criminalize its distribution, like China, Cuba, South Korea (and the DPRK, no relation), Iceland, etc). And in places like the US and Canada where I'm from, I don't even know if they *have* distribution restrictions because there is absolutely zero barrier to finding it online. Fuller disclosure, while I'm against porn, I am NOT against pretty much any in-person sexual encounter, as long as all parties are legal adults and all parties consent. But that's a whole other can of worms, we're here to talk about furry porn.So let's talk about all the ways furry porn is highly problematic! Trigger warning will be given here as I'm about to talk in detail about all matter of abnormal, even criminal sexual conduct. 1. It really does alter your perception of what real sex and intimacy are actually like, especially if you're exposed to it as a minor before you've had natural and healthy sexual encounters. There have been many, many psych studies about this, it's about as proven as gravity. People say ""porn is unrealistic"" and they are right, but that really doesn't cover it. We as a society are generally *really* bad about having fact-based, comprehensive sex ed and teaching teens what healthy sexual relationships are actually like. Blame the Christians for that, but that only means the porn industry has all the more possibility to harm developing minds. If you see two wolves with penises bigger than their legs going at it before you've learned what normal human sex is like, that's it, that shit's permanent. And it's *really* easy to access to. Search online for the wrong pop culture character, even on the highest content restriction mode, and you're bound to come across porn of them. It wouldn't be a meme if the people who aren't into it wasn't accidentally accessing it all the time. 2. It is *my opinion* that contrary to popular belief, furry porn is *not* ""progressive"" and exploits LGBTQ+ people much more than it ""empowers"" them. As I am not LGBTQ+, I am admittedly only seeing this from an outsider's view, so if any actual LGBTQ+ people disagrees I consider your opinion valid. But I really don't think making pornography of a marginalized community helps them in any way, especially since it's mostly non-LGBTQ+ people making it. Rather, I think it objectifies or commodifies them, turning the movement into at best a source of money for unscrupulous straight people at best, and at worst turning it into nothing a set of highly stereotyped and exaggerated sexual behaviors, and tossing the fact that *LGBTQ+ people are **people** with lives that involve more than just sex* by the wayside. Also, I'm a minority where I live, being an Asian in a white country, and the last thing I'd want is for some white guy to draw Asian porn for other white guys to fap to, all while claiming that it ""empowers"" the Asian diaspora, I assume the LGBTQ+ community is similar, but please do correct me if I'm wrong. 3. Furry characters are sometimes used as a stand-in for minors and a loophole for ""legal CP"". It's even a named category, called ""Cub"" or ""Cub porn"". Some background: almost every country in the entire world criminalizes drawn or animated CP and treats it exactly the same as real-life CP. The US and Japan are the two most infamous exceptions to this. However, even in countries that criminalize cartoon CP, depending on how the legislation is worded, they can miss the rampant epidemic of clearly underage sexualized furry characters. Basically, because most of the legal definitions of CP are based around sexualization of humans, an easy bypass for them in many countries is to cover your clearly underage character in fur, give them fox ears and a snout, and then confidently draw unspeakable things being done to them that the courts can't do anything about. I think it was either France or Poland that ruled that while sexualized cartoon humans drawn in a more or less realistic style can be CP, it does not extend to ""anime"" characters (the huge eyes and exaggerated proportions was a major reason IIRC) or ""catgirls"" (cartoon humans with cat ears). So I assume furries are not covered either. But, come on, you're not watching underage furry porn because you're attracted to the fur or the ears or the muzzle, you're watching underage furry porn because you're a pedophile who knows you'd go to jail if you watched the human stuff. 4. Are we seriously not concerned about a possible furry porn to bestiality pipeline? I haven't found many clinical studies on furry porn specifically, but what I *have* read are many studies that find a very clear link between people who watch CP and people who would eventually go on to actually molest a child. The very nature of sexual disorders is that they are perpetually escalating if untreated.5. People who are addicted to pornography, especially weird pornography and fetishes, need psychiatric treatment, not enforcement of their illness by having unlimited access to porn. I think this is self explanatory. If someone is addicted to watching dogs fuck, would you rather they keep doing it or they get medical help? Furries are notorious for encouraging people to watch furry porn, and to get into more and more unhinged fetishes, and it's a massive societal problem. We need to make it clear that this behaviour is *not* healthy by making the barrier to it high. Think about how heavily regulated cigarettes, alcohol, and weed are and how hard it is to get them, and all the packaging are required to be plastered with encouragements to stop and get help. So what should be done about this? Well, we already have obscenity laws, so expand them! In many cases not even that is necessary and only better enforcement is needed. Take the resources spent shooting minorities and their dogs and use it to take down furry porn sites and porn producers. I personally don't think it makes sense to criminalize simple possession and access of any kind of porn *except* for CP, but manufacture, distribution, and advertising of any porn should be criminalized. I know that the majority of Reddit is extremely pro porn and most furries think there's nothing wrong with furry porn, so have at thee and debate me.",""
"265","CMV: Intersectionality is failing"," Intersectionality is the idea that minority groups in society have interests in common, and shared experience of oppression that they should cooperate with each other to advocate for policies that will benefit them, a sort of tit-for-tat arrangement., But I don’t think it’s particularly controversial to note that the vast majority of people who are against the LGBT movement are people who have darker skin tones, who would be considered minorities in the West.Equally, there are fractures developing within the LGBT movement itself around the status of trans people, and conflict with radical feminists and the female empowerment movement.Some of the founders of feminism in Europe were incredibly racist and Openly advocated for eugenics, and there are also conflicts between working-class natives and immigrants which are not based on race but the perception that jobs are being taken away.I guess what I’m trying to say is that the idea that minority groups have shared interests and should ally with each other to fulfil those is increasingly being shown as not being actually the case.",""

"267","CMV: I believe that practically every pro-choice argument when it comes to abortion also applies to assisted suicide, and I don't understand how you can support one without the other.","To clarify: I am pro-choice and pro assisted suicide. Though this argument also applies the other way around.When I talk about assisted suicide I mean specifically the process for a person to be euthanased medically by professionals, and that it should be legal and available for almost anyone barring some limitations (more on that later).This all thing started with the recent laws in Canada for assisted suicide, which let people to end their lives even if they don't have a terminal illness (I don't know the intrecate details of the law and it's not very relevant).I've seen plenty of people arguing that this law is basically a genocide of poor people.The idea is that a lot of people who would choose to go through that because of their material conditions, would not have if they had the money for a better life - maybe better medical treatment or better living situation, etc.And that by giving people this option, the government is saying that it rathers to get rid of poor people instead of improving their lives.What strikes me about this, is that the exact same thing could be said about abortions - how many of them happened because a person wanted to have a baby but couldn't support it financially? Or couldn't afford to be pregnant?I think people are aware of these cases, but still accept them in effort to reduce suffering and in the name of bodily autonomy.And the more I think about it, every single argument for abortion also applies to assisted suicide:- it might end a life, but bodily autonomy takes precedence.- People don't sign in to being pregnant, just as they don't do for life. It's ok for whoever wants to continue, but forcing it on people who will suffer for it and want to quit is cruel- It might hurt people around them but the person who controls the body gets to make the choiceYou get the idea.I do think there should be some limitations.Obviously late abortions are rarer and have different conditions and I think that's agreeable by almost everyone.And being pro choice means presenting all the options, including abortion and letting the person choose when informed.So I believe the same for assisted suicide - we should have alternatives and some limitations (age, maybe a waiting period as it is not time sensitive as an abortion), but still be generally available as an option.Why is this CMV?We'll, honestly I feel like I'm missing a big piece of it.I see people talking about assisted suicide like it's so obviously wrong that I think there must be something that I'm not seeing.Since this subject is taboo arguments about it are rare and I feel like I haven't seen the other side's points fully.",""

"269","CMV: Bill Russell is overrated","To those who don’t know Bill Russell was a basketball player who in his 13 years in the nba won 11 rings. As such he is widely considered a top 5 nba player of all time and the nba last year even retired 6 for the whole league in honor of him similar to the mlb retiring 42 for the great jackie Robinson and the NHL retiring 99 or Wayne Gretzky. However I just dont think Russell is that great of a player. He’s at most a borderline top 10 player but certainly not a top 5 player.To start off Russell’s rings were objectively easier to win compared to now. The playoff format was just 2 rounds and then the finals with the first round being best of 3 and second being best of 5. As such Russell played in less games and needed to win less meaning he and his team could conserve energy for a deep playoff run. On top of that there is the fact the league only had 10 teams and 8 teams made the playoffs meaning terrible teams were guaranteed a spot. It wasn’t uncommon for teams with losing records to make the playoffs. One year a team with just 16 wins made it in.The second part is how much talent the C’s had during his time. His team consistently had 3 all stars including Russell which is far more difficult than people think. Looking at his teammatesCousy (1950-1963) - 13x all star and 12x all NBA in 13 yearsSharman (1950-1961) - 8x all star and 7x all NBA in 10 yearsHeinsohn (1956-1965) - 6x all star and 4x all NBA in 9 yearsHavlicek (1962-1978) 13x all star and 11x all NBA in 16 yearsSam Jones (1957-1969) - 5x all star and 3x all NBA in 11 years.Another thing worth mentioning is all these guys except Heinsohn were recently voted for the nba 75th anniversary team where they pick the top 75 players of all time. It’s also worth mentioning Frank Ramsey was the team’s de facto 6th man, was widely considered a starting caliber player and is in the HoF despite not making an all star. I didn’t open up with HoFers arguments because people inevitably make the claim they were only HoFers because of Russell and having a lot of rings.The only player this really applies to is K.C. Jones who never made an all star in his 12 year career and never averaged more than 10 pts a game and had a career stat line of 7/6/2. So only K.C. Jones and maybe Ramsey are arguing undeserving of their HoF status. It should be noted the HoF isn’t just for the NBA but for all of basketball and Jones’ claim undoubted comes from not only his rings but his NCAA titles and Olympic gold (which he also rode Bill’s coattails in both but hey the man is only 1/8 players to have the hat trick ok). I’m sorry but I don’t see how you can look at these teammates and say Bill somehow elevated them especially since many of these guys still made all stars and all NBA teams before and after Russell. Plus if that was the case Don Nelson would be in the HoF as a player but he isn’t, he’s in the HoF as a coachTo top it all off Russell had Red Aurbach who is arguably the greatest coach in nba history. So Russell was on a stacked team for over a decade, with the greatest HC of all time, in a small league with little player movement. I see people somehow spin it to claim less teams means talent is more evenly distributed but that is blatantly untrue and has always been untrue for sports. Like name me one player from the Syracuse Nationals or Rochester Royals without looking up anyone. Simply put Boston had a monopoly on talent to the point where even their 6th man could’ve been an all star on another team. And having less times is not harder. More teams means there is more randomness. If you’re playing the same teams over and over again you can better prepare against them especially if they consistently have the same rosters. So already we see Russell’s rings are just as much a product of being on all time great teams as playing in a weak league. Not to mention rings are a team effort so they should not be the deciding factor to how great a player is. Which brings us to his individual statsRussell was said to be a defensive juggernaut. Unfortunately blocks werent recorded back then so we can only go off hearsay. However there is no doubt Russell was an all time rebounder as he ranks number 2 behind rival Wilt Chamberlain for all time boards at 21k over 900 games and 22.5 rebounds per game again just shy of Wilt’s 22.9 per game and being the only other player in history to have 20 or more rebounds a game. However offensively he left a lot to be desired. He scored a total of 14522 career points or 15 PPG, never having scored more than 20. That is pathetic for a supposed all time great. Keep in mind those numbers are actually inflated. That’s right despite being fairly above average his numbers are arguably inflated as the pace of the game was much faster in the 1960s which also explains his high rebounding numbers. Regardless Russell was not a great offensive player and an all time great has to be great on both ends of the ball. Russell was only slightly more efficient as a scoring with his career FG percentage being 44% which TBF for his time was about in line, slightly above average actually since the average percentage for a player was in the high 30s-low 40s and he did have seasons where he shot as high as 47% but again not all time great. Plus as a 6’10” center he’s going to naturally be under the basketball more often and get higher percentage shots.Russell fans will try to defend him saying he was a passing big but his career average assists is 4 per game which is hardly higher than any other big like say Bob Pettit of the hawks whose career assists was 3.4 per game. TBF Russell did become more of a passer after Cousy retired but he was only the team’s leading assist leader once.Now am I saying Russell is a bad player? No. Russell is most certainly a top 20 player of all time, maybe a top ten player. And TBF for Russell, his playoff numbers are generally better than his regular season numbers, however there is simply no justification of putting him in the top 5. Already I think of several other players who are superior to Russell. Bird, Johnson, Jordan, James, Jabbar, Duncan, O’Neal, Chamberlain all come to mind before Russell. Even Antekoumpo and Jokic are neck and neck with Russell and the only reason I’d put Russell over them slightly is his rings and mvps. But to say he’s top 5 all time is too far for me since the numbers just dont prove it.",""
"270","CMV: We could just as easily say ""oneteen"" instead of ""eleven.""","**Edit**: My view is almost completely changed. That was fast. Now I know that ""oneteen"" doesn't make sense because the pattern of numbers in the teens is ordinal number - last sound + teen, so even if I wanted eleven to fit into the pattern it would be ""firsteen,"" not ""oneteen."" I also know now that eleven is a strange number in several languages because, in part, of the rate at which it's used compared to other numbers. Partly, too, numbers below twelve have a unique naming system compared to those after 12 because 12 is such a unique number in division. So, I no longer think that ""oneteen"" is pretty much the same as ""eleven."" This isn't the most sophisticated thought in the world, but we could just as easily say ""oneteen."" It's fewer syllables than ""eleven"" and it follows the pattern of other 10s, except ""twelve"" but obviously I think we could say ""twoteen"" if we really wanted to. The only other language I know is Spanish, and their word for ""eleven"" is more in line with the rest of their tens column.There's no huge benefit to it, on balance. It might make counting past ten a little bit more intuitive for children (that's what triggered the thought), but I don't know that they struggle all that much with it. I mostly just think, linguistically, it would make just as much sense if the English language evolved to say ""oneteen."" It's a little bit awkward to have the ""ne"" but we do that for ""nineteen"" and people get a long just fine.I'm not even saying we should change it, so this is a super narrow CMV. Just that it would make sense, and it's a weird inexplicable quirk of our language that we say ""eleven.""",""

Tiffany had auditioned for the season prior, but failed to make the final cut due to failed psych evaluations and getting into a bar fight.Tyra put Tiffany through anger management. Tiffany came back and made the final cut. She was ELATED, and shared a story about how her grandmother deferred paying her electric bill, let her lights go out, so she could buy Tiffany a swimsuit for the competition.Just watching the season in general, I could tell that towards (and during) that final episode, I could tell Tiffany sort of gave up. The teleprompter reading challenge, where Tiffany was saying ""I can't read this"" I could tell she was defeated, and Tyra and her panel did not help.Eventually, Tiffany was eliminated. Tiffany didn't cry when she was told she was out. She was laughing and hugging and shit. She was being a good sport and taking it in stride. I would be proud of her too. Apparently, Tyra wasn't. She called Tiffany and Rebecca (the other girl eliminated) praising Rebecca for showing emotion after losing, then launching her attack at Tiffany, how it was a joke to her, how her grandmom got her lights shut off, talking about anger management. Tiffany tried defending herself, before Tyra eventually flips out on her. Tyra was upset at Tiffany's attitude and not trying. If she really cared about it, she would have done this speech BEFORE she was eliminated instead of after when it didn't matter.A lot of that stuff was just...wrong and uncalled for. IT was uncalled for of her to scream at her and tell her to ""be quiet.""""When my mother yelled like this it's because she loved me""Funny.

"272","CMV: if generative AI (in its current state) is making things that could replace your art, then your art is simply not very good","I’m definitely sensitive to the fact that AI images could be used in fraudulent ways, and I get the concern that in the long run this technology could take away artist jobs.But frankly, just looking at the images currently rendered by MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, etc… I mean, they’re really COOL for sure, but artistically speaking? They’re not good. At worst, you’ve got mangled hands and facial features and so on. At best, you have a scene that totally lacks personality and dynamicism and intelligent composition. Like those “such and such movie as an 80’s dark-sci-fi film” pictures — really impressive detail and realism, but no life. The characters are stock-still and expressionless. Many have their backs turned. There’s no implied movement. Just… these are not choices any halfway-decent artist would ever make.So I just have a hard time totally sympathizing with artists who treat this as an immediate threat. Like… either your art should look better than this or you shouldn’t expect to earn awards or money for it, in the first place. In any case, if your art looks like this, it’s mediocre at best. As a creative type myself, I’m still mystified by the “I worked hard on this so I deserve x y and z.” Because that’s just not how it works.This even extends to the questionable matter of how these AI are trained. Some artists have come forward alleging their art was used to train AI without their knowledge or consent. I can sympathize to an extent but ok… first of all they probably signed something without reading it first. Same is true for most of us who post OC online, I’d imagine. Still your responsibility tho! Gotta live with the consequences. But aside from that… like it just feels to me like a sort of cynical opportunistic move to try and win royalties on some generic art-school schlock that didn’t have much if any monetary potential to begin with. So I dunno, I feel like a bit of an asshole saying this but frankly, I’d care way more about this if I felt the artwork “at risk” here was actually like, good enough to be culturally significant in any way. I think it’s inevitable that one day AI will make art just as good if not better than humans, but until AI can either possess or understand human emotions, I think that day is a long way off. Plus, whenever a digital artist uses generative AI as one of many tools in their creative process, producing original work, the results are LIGHTYEARS ahead of any of these pure-AI renders. Meaning that a) this is real art, it’s not being “cheapened” by the artist’s choice of creative media, and b) instead of complaining about AI “replacing” us, we could just use it to level up our work and stay ahead of the automation stuff. So I just can’t really see what the issue is. Seems to me like a bow that ties itself.",""

I like the part where she sings ""he's my sun, he makes me shine"" but then she ruins it with diamonds. I'm not familiar with famous peoples life so maybe I can't understand where she comes from with the lyrics but to a normal person the lyrics sound so superficial and shallow it's not even funny. It's like beauty is everything, diamonds are the best thing in the world and without them you have nothing worthy. Is there something I'm not understanding from the song? There are references to new age and religion but I think it makes the lyrics even more shallow. I really love her other lyrics, they've had so many layers. One of my favourites is Video games. It's  a truly beautiful and dark story. To me this song is dissapointing, I wish there were other lyrics I could listen to it since the melody and her voice are so beautiful.Edit: I think the problem in the song for me is that the singer's values are distorted: she has learned that diamonds, youth and beauty are important and she is wondering if her lover will still love her when she doesn't have those things. The problem isn't the love between the two since it is real and beautiful, it's the character's values that are ""wrong"". It's a deep belief that she doesn't really say out loud but I still hear it in the lyrics and it disturbes me.Here the lyrics for reference:I've seen the world, done it all, had my cake nowDiamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air nowHot summer nights, mid-JulyWhen you and I were forever wildThe crazy days, city lightsThe way you'd play with me like a childWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?I know you will, I know you will, I know that you willWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage nowChanneling angels in the new age nowHot summer days, rock and rollThe way you'd play for me at your showAnd all the ways I got to knowYour pretty face and electric soulWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?I know you will, I know you will, I know that you willWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?Dear Lord, when I get to HeavenPlease let me bring my manWhen he comes, tell me that you'll let him inFather, tell me if you canAll that grace, all that bodyAll that face makes me wanna partyHe's my sun, he makes me shine like diamondsWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?",""

"278","CMV: Abortion is justified in the first trimester in the cases of rape. Even if Personhood starts at conception.","I should preface this by saying that I am pro-life.However as I've continued to debate the pro-life argument I have been stumped on rape cases.Now I do wanna state my mind on abortion as a whole is not really going to change and nor is that really what this CMV is about.For the purpose of this CMV. There are my viewpoints.- Human Life starts at conception- Personhood is discrimination (This is my viewpoint of personhood but essentially the idea here is to disregard it entirely. For this CMV you can assume it starts at conception)- Consent to sex is Consent to pregnancy (I am actually not so sure about the statement itself being correct but the idea here is that consensual sex is taking responsibility for your actions. I am only mentioning this to showcase the difference between rape cases and consensual cases. Because you can't choose to not feed your child your responsible for)- Body Autonomy does not give you the right to murder other human beings.As for Body Autonomy argument this is where I'm not so sure if banning abortions is logically consistent to that argument of rape casesThere is an abortifacient that can allow women to not provide nutrients to her baby. In which case that to me is similar to the Violinist argument. That you can unplug. To those who aren't aware the violinist argument is that you are kidnapped and connected to the violinist. You are the only one who can donate resources to the violinist. However this is not forever. You are only stuck for 9 months. Many people that you have the right to unplug. Now whether or not you will is irrelevant to the point that the government cannot interfere with said situation. Even if you unplug with the intention of wanting to kill the violinist you will still be allowed to unplug. It would be unethical but again not really the point. So the argument typically falls down (in my belief that's why I'm asking here) is whether or not its active killing or passive killing.The argument I've seen is that you are attacking its environment with the abortifacient hence its active killing. But this does not convince me. It is just a he said she said scenario. A pro-lifer will tell me its active killing and a pro-choicer will tell me its passive killing. This is not necessarily the argument I'm stuck on you can give me a different argument. But I'm simply pointing out this is one of the arguments.",""

"280","CMV: ""Whiteness Studies"" is Founded on Opinion and Assumption, not on Scientific Evidence or Critical Thinking.","- I've been curious about the origins of the concept of ""Whiteness"" recently. I came across the influential article ""[White Supremacy Culture](https://www.whitesupremacyculture.info/uploads/4/3/5/7/43579015/okun_-_white_sup_culture_2020.pdf)"" by Tema Okun. It's been the basis of many lists and other articles discussing the traits of ""Whiteness."" - I agree with roughly 80-90% of the ideas presented therein. Largely because I have been raised to understand these ideas as toxic (in the broadest definition of the term). My family comes from a part of the Midwest where the average home didn't have 2.3 kids. My mom doesn't stop talking about how close and interconnected the community was, and how much she dislikes the rampant ""individualism"" and the detached nuclear families we sometimes see. My family are all very pale variations of white. Most of my life the communities I've grown up in were predominately white. - When I look at these lists - of Tema Okun and the Smithsonian's ""Aspects and Assumptions of Whiteness & White Culture in the United States"" - and am told that they are aspects of ""Whiteness"" I simply have to balk. I agree that the traits being talked about *as defined in Okun's paper* (perfectionism, individualism, only one way, paternalism, defensiveness, objectivity, either or, progress is bigger, quantity over quality, worship of the written word, fear of conflict, power hoarding, right to comfort, a constant sense of urgency) can be toxic. Furthermore, I find that the suggestions made in Okun's paper are more pedestrian than radical (take time to make sure that everyone's work and efforts are appreciated, understand that emotional intelligence is a useful tool, etc.). I disagree that my culture exemplifies these traits, or has a near monopoly on these traits. I also disagree that any white culture exemplifies or monopolizes these traits more than most (if not any) other. - Meditation on this has moved me to try to do some light study on the academic literature of these ideas. In my limited time and study, I've found a few points that I view as problems with Whiteness Studies. 	- First, Whiteness Studies uses unclear and even impenetrable, inconsistent language. Whiteness is often interchangeably used to refer to ""white people"", ""white culture"", and ""white supremacy"" without distinguishing which is being talked about leading to needlessly offending people, and allowing others to make sweeping generalizations and oversimplifications. Additionally, The language used in Whiteness Studies is needlessly offensive and divisive, thus forming a counterproductive discussion and making it more difficult for actual research and dialogue to take place. 	- Second, white people and culture is presented as a monolith, ignoring the diversity of cultures (many of which do not match the ideas presented in the many ""traits of Whiteness"" lists). This - I would argue - perpetuates some of the same thinking rightly vilified in ""White Supremacy Culture"". (Just a single example: Under ""Perfectionism"" Okun writes to the effect ""Refusal to identify, name, define, and appreciate what is right/good and only focus on the bad."" Whiteness is only discussed as a negative, rather than a positive, or even neutral thing.)	- Third, Whiteness Studies thought leaders do not offer rigorously researched, empirical evidence for their conclusions, but rather rely on anecdotal evidence, and a ""this or that"" view of certain statistics (which could have other valid interpretations which are rejected). - As I've gone over the paper, [and it's revised edition](https://www.whitesupremacyculture.info/), I can't help but feel these traits are better described as being American Corporate Culture. - To the best of my knowledge, Whiteness Studies is not a scientific field, nor is it even a rigorously reasoned field of critical thought.

In America, at least, there is talk of possibly going into one of the worst recessions ever and people are just casually making videos that are just wasting food. Most of the time it is in very big quantities. I see people making insanely huge salads in their sinks. I see people doing things on purpose just for the rage effect when prepping food. Half the time it is not something edible at the end, the other half it is edible but the ingredients they used were so outlandish and ridiculous that you would not want to eat it for any amount of money. We are in a reality where a dozen eggs is now $10 in places. Simple ingredients are something that minimum wage people can’t afford anymore. No joke. 90% of the time the people who make these videos, it is obvious that they are well off. Their kitchen, utensils, and everything that you can see are pretty expensive and not cheap. They have money and the views they get from the videos makes their pockets even bigger so they could care less. There is no point to these type of videos and honestly it enrages me every time I see one. I understand it is for entertainment value, but I believe this is not that. It is a blatant show of wastefulness and the people need to be stopped. I think their must be a way to find these people and issue them a fine or in extreme cases serve some jail time. Please help me CMV so I don’t get filled with rage Everytime I see them and I can maybe understand it more bc I’m not seeing it.",""
"282","CMV: ""Vote with your wallet"" is great in theory but often flawed in practice.","Hey allI was thinking about this recently and I figured I'd bring it up. Often-times, I see many people opting to ""vote with their wallets"" and being encouraged to do so by others in various situations. My understanding of this is that ""voting with your wallet"" is a way for consumers to push for change in the business practices of companies and the basic idea is that consumers can use their purchasing power to support companies that *do* align with their values and boycott companies that do not.Just for clarification, I am not incredibly into the subject, it was more of a shower thought initially but I wanted to hear other's opinions to maybe help shed light on the topic.I understand that this, in practice, would never really seem like such a bad thing and I actually do support the ideology behind it; However, this approach, as far as I know, rarely ever leads to any significant change and like most things, need more than a few angry people on twitter to make any sort of effect and that is exactly what I am on about specifically with this. Here's a few other reasons I can think of why this approach doesn't always work:\- Markets for goods and services are incredibly competitive, and consumers often have *very* limited purchasing options when it comes to products that align with their values. For instance, looking for a car that is environmentally friendly but doesn't make a dent in your wallet, rather than a range of affordable options (this probably is becoming less of a case nowadays the more companies are actively shifting to greener options) could be a factor.\- Companies, especially the HUGE ones are able to easily look the other way in the face of boycotts and protests because of the sheer scale of their customer base, a large majority of them either having no other option, the convenience of it is ends enough to justify the means or quite frankly not even being motivated by the same concerns as those who are boycotting. Not to mention the fact that certain companies may gain more traction due to lower prices and/or increase convenience. As a result, the impact of ""voting for your wallet"" with these companies will most likely remain marginal.\- Companies could easily use marketing and PR to deflect criticism and create the idea of change rather than actually changing their practices. Think of clothing companies using sweatshop labour who may end up shifting production to other countries with worse labour standards. Think of all the people buying clothing, shoes etc. As far as I know, a lot of that industry is plagued with forced, child or both, labour (or if not that, then the working conditions themselves being poor at the very least) yet people still consume these products without a second thought. I don't think people should necessarily *care* and that might be a different point but it's that very same lack of care that contributes to how marginal of a difference I believe this ideology has/makes.Maybe there is a level of misunderstanding that I haven't quite understood yet or rather it a simple phrase coined to basically just say ""act in your best interest"" or ""do what feels right to you"".Ultimately, the ideology feels practical but its frequently flawed in practice. I think that's why a lot of political action, activism and community organization has done more to try and push for change (think the Netflix situation with the password thing being an ""error"" only to go on and make more terrible decisions) than a simple individual's acts of ""voting with their wallet"" out of their own moral/value systems. I'd love to hear what others think on this topic and be sure to correct me if my understanding in of itself is flawed. All is welcome!Edit: Continuation of ""PR to deflect criticism point"".Edit 2: Wow! A lot of very solid opinions. I hope I managed to get to everybody. I realize now that my use of ""flawed"" was a bit strong when I might have fared better using something a little less harsh. I also should've clarified that I am specifically talking about HUGE companies like Nike, Apple, Nestlé, Adidas, Amazon, EA, Ubisoft etc. It's much harder for this philosophy/ideology to have a good effect on these companies when they have such a large customer base where it becomes increasingly more difficult unless laws/legislation/regulation are passed to really make a significant difference at that scale.Finally my original post doesn't take into account all of the SMALL wins that sometimes never really gets enough traction or is otherwise overlooked (like I sure did) when discussing something like this. Small steps are small steps and a lot of small steps make a big difference in the grand scheme of things! Thank you everyone who has took the time to discuss this with me and remind me of that.Edit 3: Final edit. Thanks again to everyone who engaged in this discussion with me, I've been at this for like 4 hours now so I will be slowing replies as I need to get on with other things but I will routinely check back in and respond here and there. Thanks again for keeping everything civil and respectful on all ends! :)",""
"283","CMV: We can't prove that anything exists outside of our own mind","It is impossible to prove that any physical thing exists outside of our own mind. There may be strong evidence that things continue to exist when we're not there, such as the fact that we can return and find things the way we left them or changed by other individuals, but this is still all occurring within our own mind. There is no way to conduct any experiments that are removed from our own subjective experience, and thus there is no way we can definitively say that there is any material stuff outside of our experience.",""
"284","CMV: There are inherently people who are more valuable to society than others, and the most fair way for society to function is to treat these groups differently.","This may sound harsh but I don’t think I’m wrong to say this but there are some people who simply cannot benefit society in the ways others can mostly due to intelligence. For example take me, I am a software developer who works for a medical technology company. I attended a good university on a full ride, and was able to get this job almost straight out of college. The work I do helps people and will for years to come. Unfortunately not everyone can do this. Luckily there are jobs they can do.Fast food, retail, construction, etc. Things that someone of my intelligence would be wasted on, however are still necessary for a functioning society. The thing is, these jobs are nowhere near as necessary as my job. My job is nowhere near as necessary as a doctors. It would be unfair to offer the same benefits that they receive to me.So these people working these lesser jobs shouldn’t be making enough to rival what I make. Like let’s be real, in my current position I make 65k a year, should a person flipping burgers at McDonalds make that much money for their labor? Of course not. They make back the value they provide to society. This is fair.",""
"285","CMV: Retirement is overrated","I’m a young adult in my late twenties and believe that retirement is overrated for multiple reasons.EDIT: To clarify, I think saving money for a day where you’re too ill to work is a good idea. I don’t think saving up money for a retirement is overrated. This is not the idea I’m disputing. Rather, I think the idea of retirement, as in when you stop working at 65 so you can have free time to do things you want, is overrated. 1. I would rather live my life to the fullest while I’m young rather than wait to actually start living my life when I’m old. I think a more balanced approach of taking sabbaticals every few years to focus on some other projects and goals outside of work sounds a lot more reasonable. 2. The future is never promised. To save up money and work my ass off for 50+ years just to die right after I retire would be such a waste. Not to mention I’m not very hopeful about the future of our planet with climate change and who knows if I’ll even live into my 50s. I just think the idea of postponing your most burning passions and projects to a later time far out in the future is too optimistic, because tomorrow is never promised. You could die any day.3. I don’t think there will ever come a day where I find myself not wanting to do some form of work. I’m an extrovert, I love going out into the world and seeing and connecting with people. Work is a major part of maintaining my social life and feeling apart of my community. So I still imagine myself working in my old age. 4. I think that living a lifestyle that is sustainable (that you can maintain over time) is more important than making a ton of money now so you can have a ton of free time later. Instead I would rather save a *some* money now and have *some* free time now. This means I live a modest life, keep my expenses in check, and still manage to put a little money into savings. And then I can maintain that through my entire life. Besides most people have to downgrade their lifestyle when they retire because they won’t be making as much money from their pension as when they were working. 5. Surely there is the counter argument of needing sufficient savings for old age because I may get ill and be physically or mentally unable to work. But if I am no longer able to work, I think that is when I would lean on my retirement savings and government programs like CPP and OAS (I live in Canada for context). Plus if my health deteriorates too much I think I would honestly just rather die than be so unwell that I can’t even work.Don’t get me wrong, I hate work just as much as the next person and only want to work as much as I need to sustain myself. But I just feel it is more reasonable and sustainable to spread my “retirement years” over the entire span of my life through sabbaticals and time off work rather than saving up all this free time in hopes to use it when I turn 65+",""
"286","CMV: If you own a gun, you should be held to higher standards than are currently required such as bearing the responsibility for any crimes committed with the weapon and continuous training on firearm safety and competence.","I’ve never posted to this sub-Reddit before, but I love reading the discussions. I hope I am presenting this topic clearly but if not please forgive me.Gun owners have a unique and very serious obligation to our society to make sure guns are stored properly and are owned by capable and responsible individuals.I believe that, in the event of theft, if it can be determined that the gun was not stored safely and or the theft not reported in a timely manner, gun owners should bear partial responsibility for any crime committed with said gun.If a gun owner knowingly loans a gun to someone who is not certified to use the gun or sells the gun illegally, the gun owner should share equal blame for any illegal actions involving the use of the gun.Before anyone complains about having to be subjected to scrutiny in either of these occasions because of certain amendments, please consider that this type of treatment is not isolated to gun ownership.Responsibility for a car (requiring a license and ensuring the vehicle for example) or even bearing the responsibility of children, dogs, or anything to do with public safety is scrutinized just as sharply. Gun ownership is arguably held to a much lower standard considering the potential risk to public safety.In addition, gun owners have an obligation to not only receive initial training but also should be required to have continuing education on firearm safety and competence.In summary, If gun owners are adverse to any of the above mentioned penalties involving the theft or the loaning of a gun or if they are opposed to stricter prerequisites of owning a gun, I suggest that they are not as responsible as they would like to think and therefore should not own a firearm. This is not an unreasonable expectation.Before anyone says anything about second amendment rights, please don’t. Until the second amendment is held to the same standards for \[all citizens\] ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKGZnB41\_e4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKGZnB41_e4)), it should not be used as an excuse for irresponsible gun ownership.Please note that I referenced public safety above, this is important. Irresponsible gun ownership puts the safety of others at risk and restrictions imposed upon firearms should therefore be prioritized above personal freedom to a reasonable extent.This is not a plea to ban guns. This is a hypothetical compromise. In our day and age it seems that compromising is a four letter word no matter which position you take. I think this is a huge detriment to our society. In the spirit of bipartisanship and the collective good, I argue that these are reasonable suggestions, and I would ask that you think about the limitations I have suggested as a compromise and not an attack. But if I am woefully misguided because of ignorance on my part I am interested to see counter arguments as this sub seems to bring out some compelling and civil discussions.&#x200B;EDIT: I want to put an edit on in case you are responding with a point that was already made so I will address a few of them here. 1: I totally rescind my hardline on liability,  it is unethical and the issue is far to complex to suggest such a broad and unforgiving penalty. 2: I sourced a video I thought showed the double standards of the second amendment but this was pretty short sighted as well considering my suggestions would actually hinder already at risk individuals. I think its an important video to view but I appreciate being shown the contradictory nature of my point. 3: I cringed pretty hard on a lot of the responses just because they showcased my ignorance on a lot of things but I am glad I had the opportunity to discuss this issue with people who had varied and meaningful perspectives to share with me. No regrats 4: For the hateful few, I mean do you but I think your hurting yourself more than me. It's not good for you mental health to get so worked up over me, a person pretty comfortable with their own stupidity, on an internet forum rife with anonymity and extremes. Take care of yourself people.  I am still concerned about guns and gun safety but thanks to this post I have changed my view quite substantially and will research the topic of gun laws very thoroughly before making decisions based on the issue and I have you people to thank for it.

"287","CMV: The concept of ableism, as it is recognized in modern society, is a non-issue. A perspective from a physically disabled person","I am specifically referring to the idea that people claiming that someone thinking that a disability is something wrong with someone is ableist. That is the literal definition of a disability. A non-ability to do something caused by either an error in the genetic makeup of a person or due to an injury rendering someone unable to do something a ""normal"" person can do. I'll use myself as an example. I am paraplegic. I have Spina Bifida at the T-10 level. I cannot walk and am confined to a wheelchair. Therefore, I, not having the ability to walk like an able-bodied person, have something that makes me able to do less and therefore I have something wrong with my physical body that is preventing this. That is just a fact. It's not discriminatory to point that out, at least not to me. There is a physical deformity (a deformity being, by definition, something that is not formed correctly) in my spine that is preventing me from doing something someone without that physical deformity can do. This is at least my view, as someone who lives with it. I'm open to hearing other perspectives as to why it may bother some people.EDIT: I realize I may have misunderstood what true ableism is as I have not faced it personally in my everyday life. I was referring to what many people tout as ableism online as my definition of ableism. I do see how the discrimination factor would be true ableism, but I have seen so many people get up in arms for people just acknowledging the fact that someone is disabled and calling it ableism.",""
"288","CMV: Public transport can't solve traffic","Disclaimer: I am not a traffic scientist or an urban designer, and I do believe transit will *help* traffic, they will not solve traffic, or even make a large impact. This is also based on American transit and design (I will be talking a lot about stroads)&#x200B;The following are my opinions on traffic and public transportation:Traffic on suburban streets (and sprawl in general) I will be using Los Angeles suburbs as my example. The first problem with public transportation is with suburbs, low-density single family homes with large driveways and large streets. [LA is notorious for traffic, both on freeways and stroads](https://escholarship.org/content/qt1ms960x0/qt1ms960x0_noSplash_02bd8fa23242861e5c91dde859cc53ca.pdf?t=mnighi). A large amount of LA traffic happens in the suburbs around freeways, in low density neighborhoods. Transit can't work in these suburbs because only a low number amount of homes will be accessible to stops and stations within a reasonable walkshed.  Furthermore, only a fraction of people living near these stops and stations will actually utilize transit. Most people will still drive to places. Americans love driving. In fact, [only 16% of Americans ](https://time.com/3005148/energy-cars-driving-gas-poll/)[prefer transit.](https://time.com/3005148/energy-cars-driving-gas-poll/) And [73% of Americans prefer long-haul road trips over flying](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/a27555453/americans-prefer-road-trip-over-flying-travel/). This ties into my first point of people driving, in low-density and even high density neighborhoods, Americans don't like transit and if even presented with the option, people will drive. In low density neighborhoods especially, it makes more sense to people to drive because most likely your destination is not within walking distance, and cars are fast. (During off-peak times especially) And ""people don't want to share space with the stinky public, they prefer the car where its much better"". /hjNIMBYs (Not In My Back Yard) People who are worried about transit affecting their everyday lives. ""I would love a new metro line! Just, not near my house"" . And since American neighborhoods are already built, that would mean tearing down houses, and people give the government such a hard time when eminent domain comes into play. For example, NYC has a housing problem that they would like to fix with TOD (transit-oriented development) and TOF (transit-oriented future) [but a lot of these plans wont work because of NIMBYs](https://buildingtheskyline.org/tod-nyc/). These people are blocking projects that could help the flow of traffic, but they want it somewhere else.I'm not going to go into costs, largely because a lot of transit authorities operate at a loss and that doesn't seem to affect new plans, and because they are sometimes government funded.",""
"289","CMV: you can buy the Hogwarts Legacy game without supporting the questionable anti-trans beliefs of J.K Rowling","So this is something I've thought about for a while, and I do want to have it changed, if I've got it all wrong.I've encountered many cases of people saying that by buying a certain product you accordingly support the creator(s) of it, financially or otherwise, and as such also support them spreading their morally questionable beliefs/behaviors.It's been said for a lot of things, such as buying music from Michael Jackson and R. Kelly, to buying clothing from Nike and food from Nestlé.Most recently it has been said about buying the Hogwarts Legacy game, which is a game taking place in the fictional universe that J.K Rowling made. Rowling has the last couple of years said some questionable things regarding trans people, and as such people feel that by buying that game you automatically support her beliefs.And that is in spite how those beliefs are not only absent in the game, but actually opposed: there are trans people and gay people in the game, and they are portrayed in a positive light. Could it not also be said you support those people by buying a product that portrays them positively? What about listening to a Michael Jackson song, just to make yourself feel good? Like listening to ""heal the world"" which is about making the world a better place, in opposition to the allegations of child abuse? (for those who believe he partook in that, even though MJ doesn't live anymore to receive financial support). There are a lot of very questionable people near the top or at the top of a lot of different big/global corporations out there, including within music, housing, food, banking, gaming, IT, movies, real estate, transport, etc. Would you stop buying products from Disney because of their sweatshops, and tell your  little kid no more watching the little Mermaid? Or not buy those Nike sneakers your little boy has pleaded you about? It's difficult to say what to do.It is going to be something of a minefield to avoid paying money to some people/organizations with questionable morals, especially if you haven't researched the corporations you buy from.Now, obviously some services are more essential for survival than others, and the morals of the people/organizations in question can vary. Like, it's one thing to buy a windows PC from Microsoft, another thing to buy a kitkat from Nestlé. Simultaneously there might also be a difference in how many people are involved with making/spreading the products, such as if it is just a singer releasing an album that you more directly support, versus a global car company where the money changes a lot of hands before landing at the CEO. Certain compromises might be morally justified for specific cases. Many of us are making compromises on immoral acts on a daily basis that we accept as okay, such as eating animal meat or buying products that have been tested on/made from animals, or buying certain foods because they are cheaper and you don't have enough money to splurge. Certain cases like living in a country that has done a lot of bad things, and continues to do of bad things, is also almost unavoidable. I understand it can sometimes get a little difficult to determine where and when to draw the line. But regarding Hogwarts Legacy, I feel it isn't that big of an issue.I feel that buying the Hogwarts Legacy game is an acceptable moral compromise (especially if you openly support lgbtqia, which I do), even if it's creator differs on it (J.K Rowling that is, I don't know what Portkey/Avalanche believes).Or am I seeing this from a faulty perspective?",""
"290","CMV: Occam's Razor is a Fallacy","More precisely: The use of Occam's Razor as an argument is fallacious.I make this distinction because it seems like it was originally intended to be just a rule of thumb, but in practice it has been stretched beyond it's usefulness to exhibit some inherent truth of the world.  I'll break down the interpretations I've seen, but I'm open to more.* ""When presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should prefer the one that requires fewest assumptions.""  This seems like the most reasonable interpretation, but it is useless in arguments because people are using their assumptions to come to different conclusions.  If they agreed on the conclusion, I could see it's usefulness in eliminating unnecessary assumptions.* ""Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity.""  I feel like this one isn't saying anything of substance.  You can tell someone to not do what isn't necessary, but if they're doing it, it's probably because they think it's necessary.  It says nothing about where necessity lies.* ""The simplest explanation is usually the best one.""  This one actually says something and is the one I've seen in arguments.  However, it's used the same way an appeal to tradition or an appeal to nature might be used.  It's assumes that simplicity is good and complexity is bad without attempting to prove that.  In reality, the world is very complex and, in my opinion, to favor simpler explanations is either lazy or deceitful.  Just because something is simpler doesn't make it truer.Examples:I often see this appeal to simplicity in these two arguments, one of which I'm sympathetic to, the other I disagree with.  The first is the antitheist argument against the existence of a god.  From what I understand according to antitheists the existence of god is an unnecessary complication of reality and should be rejected, but it seems to me like the existence of god is the simplest explanation for anything.  Where an antitheist would have to describe quantum mechanics, the existence of the fundamental forces, the big bang, etc., the only explanation a theist would have to provide for any phenomenon is ""God wills it.""The second is the anti-trans or gender critical argument.  These people conflate sex and gender and favor of the idea that a man or woman is just an adult human male/female over a model of gender that takes into account physical sex, gender roles, presentation/expression, and gender identity.  They choose to stick with the simpler ideology despite the fact that it doesn't encapsulate the variance in humans.",""
"291","CMV: Technology will 'solve' philosophy","Some here may believe philosophy is an ongoing process from ignorance to truth done by man or machine. Fine, I am not here to twist arms.But approaching an achievement like solving philosophy we could find first all the smallest objects of reasoning, then combine them in - all - combinations with each other, and therefore find all possible logical results.Assuming materialism this might be the most fundamental particles. Maybe the building block is monist. If we then combine them often enough (and set an arbitrarily limit to size) then the number of combinations are limited, so it is possible to find all of them. As our computation ability grows, so does our ability to expand that size limit. Who'd do this? If we are materialist, and there is nothing special to our intelligence, then why can't we mass produce it? The intellect to do this thinking may already be the information technology we have and are developing. If we then could export that volume of philosophical data to each philosophy abled animal then wouldn't that eliminate the need to be learning it yourself? If we are not materialist, then we can conceptualise one or a few fundamental building blocks then combine them en masse. Here we'd need to specify their size again to prevent the number of combinations to be infinite.Therefore, I depend on some assumptions, but wouldn't this be a great achievement of philosophy?------- EditI'll rephrase to say we can find all information that we label as philosophical.

I can see why other people want it (but again, their reason is just that *they want them.*) They’re loud, expensive, messy, and will prevent me from completing my goals in life. One argument at a time: - They’re LOUD and high-maintenance. Waking up at 3 AM because your baby is crying for 2 years in a row sounds like a nightmare, especially when you have to wake up for work the next morning. This is not to mention that for the first 5 years, you basically can’t leave them alone, and for the 7 years after that you’re grounded where you are and very limited in what you can actually do, and your freedoms, because uprooting them would damage their development. - Suddenly your life as a parent becomes about your children. You have to wake up an hour early to get them dressed, cook for them, take them to school, then spend extra time to take them to extracurriculars, do their laundry, read to them, help them with their homework, bathe them depending on their age, etc. It’s a job before and after your job… you’ll be lucky to get an hour of free time on weekdays. Then you’re also on the hook for them on weekends. You have to plan your vacations around them.  - They’re **expensive**. It’s estimated that children on average cost $310k for the first 18 years of their life. In the search to give my child a better QOL, I would most certainly shell out more for them. How can I rationalize having a child, especially in this economy? $100K combined as a DINK is an extremely comfortable lifestyle. $100k combined with children is miserable. If my goal in life is to travel the world, how could I seek to have children while also not losing that which makes me happy in life, unless I can guarantee myself a well-paying job? Not to mention the aforementioned concerns that I’d have to be bolted down for my child. My goals in life are to enjoy myself and travel… to amass knowledge in all corners of the world, to become comfortable and live a comfortable life. Not to mention climate change, a fragile economy, and high prices making the child’s life far harder than it would have been in, say, the 80s.For these reasons, I don’t think that having a child would ever make sense.

Always from  women that were not unattractive. My intuitive reaction is to dismiss it, because I assume that the people in question are unaware of the fact that, broadly speaking, in a guy's dating life there isn't much happening without conscious effort - unless he just so happens to have a job or hobby with  eligible people and is willing to date within job- or hobby community. I assume they believe that I would get approached with a high-enough frequency - as they do. I suspect they may be unaware of the special circumstances that women above a certain attractiveness have. But I want to stay open-minded and ask: What mechanism would make it so, that not consciously trying to find a long-term partner is an advantage? Or in other words, how does the act of consciously dating sabotage the process? My personal dating philosophy is mostly that you ought to do serious internal work and be very conscious and effortful about the process - the belief that intuition and luck will get you a really good partner will make you end up following bad emotional impulses and short-term decision-making.

"294","CMV: The Russo-Ukrainian Invasion is the most morally one-sided war since 1945","I cannot think of a war since the Second World War where one combatant was as unambiguously in the right as the current invasion of Ukraine. I am primarily judging this by the following:1. The legitimacy of the actors involved (ie. an authoritarian regime or democratically legitimate government)2. The legitimacy of the reasons behind the conflict (ie. an imperialist war of conquest, a war of national defence, or some morally grey legal/economic/territorial/ethnic dispute)3. Adherence to the principles of the Just war theory in the way either side conducts themselves.With that in mind:1. Russia under Putin's regime does not in any way meet the criteria to be described as a free, democratic state. Rule of law is clearly non-existent, the leader exercises unbelievable control over the media, and peaceful criticism is routinely met with either police intervention or covert violence. Meanwhile Ukraine, while a flawed democracy with notable issues surrounding corruption, does govern with democratic legitimacy. Zelensky was elected with broad support in a free and fair election. 2. Russia's invasion was transparently imperialist in nature. Not only is it imperialist, it's imperialist in a manner we haven't seen in decades. The nonsense about threats from NATO or 'de-nazification' are clear lies. Putin has made it clear he simply does not accept the internationally acknowledged territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and there is ample evidence that the true goal is ultimately the annexation of massive swaths of Ukrainian territory, if not Ukraine in its entirety. It is the legacy project of an aging dictator. There have been other wars based on lies (the US invasion of Iraq, for example) but they were not *as* egregiously imperialist. Meanwhile, Ukraine's participation is clearly self-defence against a foreign aggressor. They have repeatedly been denied access to weapons that could even be perceived as offensive in nature. 3. There have been plenty of conflicts in recent history where actions were disproportionate, targeted non-combatants, or used practices of war widely accepted as evil (rape as a weapon of war in multiple sub-saharan African conflicts, the use of chemical weapons by both the Assad and Hussein regimes, and more). Russia's massacres, coerced recruitment, disproportionate targeting of civilians, and more aren't exactly unique, but they certainly meet the criteria of a wildly unjust war, and they are also clearly one-sided. What's more, Russia has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons, which *is* unfounded and precedent-setting, particularly in a conflict where it is unambiguously the aggressor. I cannot think of a war where all three of these criteria were so uniformly one-sided:* Russia is governed by an authoritarian regime. Ukraine is democratic. * Russia's invasion was an illegal, unprompted, imperialist act of aggression. Ukraine's defence is just that: a defence of internationally-recognized sovereign territory. * Russia's clear military inferiority has resulted in egregious crimes against humanity which -while not unique- reinforce the moral disparity between the two participants.

"295","CMV: The idea of a new world order is not as awful to me as many portray, I see allot more pros than cons by a landslide....","So, to begin i should express my personal idea of a New World Order (NWO), secondly why I believe it has more to bennefit the people than it does oppress, and thirdly the few cons I see and how they can be prevented.1: What is the NEW WORLD ORDER?The NEW WORLD ORDER, is a theory/plan that sees the entire planet Earth work as a unit rather than multiple different countries.Most theories and data on this subject lead to the conclusion that the first tier of this NWO will be implemented and ran by the United States and or multiple European countries. Most likely the European Union (UN).2: Why i believe it's not as awful as it seems to mostThis to me seems like not too much of a bad idea... for quite simple reasons.For starters these powers are accostumed to working within a wide range of ideals/beliefs and rights, The United States for example has places that are very conservative, and also some that are very liberal, there are states where gun ownership is an everyday thing and some where owning a gun is very tabboo and mostly tied to criminality. States where you will be jailed for a gram of cannabis and some where cannabis is an everyday thing.This is also true throughout Europe, some countries are very conservative yet places like Netherlands are allowed to freely sell all sorts of substances, sex work is llegal etc...When i think of a New World Government being a scary idea I only believe it's true if the powers behind it have a very narrow view as to what a ""good/efficient society"" are ,there are many places that even though I'd love to visit and endudlge in their cultures have very narrow views as to what a healthy and efficient society looks like (To my eyes).If a New World Order where ever to occur, specially ran by the UN and USA I could imagine a world where countries are left to do as they please or force democracy and human rights into them.Rather than every country being forced to live up to the standards of the UN i feel it will most likely be left to do as they should, with only a few exeptions:All the people of Earth would have the freedom to worship, freedom to express themselves and be granted basic western rights like: Fair trials, Choise of worship, feedom of speech and press, labour laws and more.In a world where we all work together as one, there would be no need for most of the wars that have been had. Instead of wars over disputes and beliefs they would be had over resources.  \[I would say that they could also force countries to give incentives for cleaner living like recycling and lowering pollution but the US seems to not respect these very much at the moment either, though places like Germany have very efficient recycling incentives in place. Generally tho this last point is pretty contested...\]3: The cons and why i think they are not too awful.It's not full proof\-Will this plan end human oppression?No, history has always been full of opressors and corruption much like the opression and corruption that is rampant in every country today and has been for centuries, it will continue no matter what changes in the law.Also opression is to the eye of the beholder, and it's difficult to provide our perspective or liberty to those who do not see one's own personal values.Some Countries might think gun ownership is a right they do NOT want provided, and if not respected could lead to very negative consequences.Some countries opress groups of people for religeous reasons, and it is a very thin line to walk on when one who says represents ""freedom of the people"" attempts to force their own ideas of freedom to those who see it as tirany/blasfamy.Because if a government is trully open it can be bent and morphed to whatever ideals they see fit, no matter how outdated or radical those changes may be.My biggest fear would be that extreme laws get passed throughout the world and no countries get to vote on their own lands, but this seems very improbable since democracy might still be distributed between different sectors allowing countries to choose the laws that reflect the people's views at local levels. That being said it's very possible most middle eastern countries would loose their right to enforce women's traditional dresses and such, which brings us back to: 'Freedom being in the eye of the beholder'.\-Is the UN a angelic force that can do no wrong?Hell no... but there are allot of scary countries and governments out there and to me it seems like Europe and most of  the American continent have the least gross violations of human rights and if in power it's very possible they reduce these violations to a wider range of people.&#x200B;\-The plan is surely not full proof and like most are starting to realize, the United States is full of holes, but it seems to me that it has less holes than many countries out there, and in a world where many countries have been ambitious enough to aim for world domination a board of the most ""Freedom loving"" people trying to do it seems like the best choice.4: Closing statement.But idk.Maybe I am missing some points.Maybe countries should be left as is.Maybe there is another way to unite ourselves as people and stop these silly territorial and belief inspired wars.I'd love to hear opinions on this, I would respectfully analize and absorb what you will have to say. Sadly reddit is a site where we cannot get too much into the mind of a country that disagrees with USA's values but hopefully we can have a clear open discussion about this very polarizing subject.",""
"296","CMV: The importance of muscularity in men with regards to dating is wildly understated","I don't believe that enough people, especially women and older individuals, particularly understand how important muscularity is in regards to dating.To clarify, I don't mean being fat vs. being not fat. I mean specifically average, even healthy, men are at a SIGNIFICANT disadvantage in comparison to muscular men.While the ""chad"" archetype is showcased all the time in media, many people often attempt to dismiss this especially in an attempt to appear less shallow. I don't think I've heard a single woman ever mention muscularity being important to whether or not they like a man but the evidence says entirely otherwise.Pretty much almost every single time someone mentions muscularity in regards to dating, there's always someone else talking about how everyone has different ""preferences."" While obviously not all women are the same, it's still pretty darn easy to find what appeals to the vast majority of them. There have been countless studies done that pretty much almost unanimously showcases women preferring muscular men to non-muscular men.Furthermore, pretty much every single muscular guy I've spoken to talked about how his dating/sex life got entirely transformed after getting buff. Most of these guys would go from struggling to even land a single date to women basically giving them their number at random to the point where they basically don't even have to try to pick up women anymore.Sure, you can say that these muscular men are more confident than non-muscular men which is definitely a factor, but in today's age where people literally judge dating partners off of slides on their smartphone, it's pretty obvious that physical appearance is tremendously helpful to finding a romantic partner than ever before (especially with how isolated we are becoming).I genuinely believe that any man who struggles with dating or doesn't have many female friends really needs to turn lifting into a hobby in order to find a partner. It's also critical to start as early as possible because people don't realize how slow building muscle really is.Edit: I am getting asked to back up my claims so I'll just link [this](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.1819) and [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/12/12/women-rate-the-strongest-men-as-the-most-attractive-study-finds/?utm_term=.c1bf51f1f3e4).I didn't really bother linking anything because genuinely almost every single thing I came across from one Google search had the same thing lol.Edit 2: I think I need to clarify how muscular I'm talking. I don't generally mean the meathead who benches 400 lbs. I mean the guy who is noticeably muscular and is more like your average gym bro. Big arms and shoulders but not super jacked.",""

Idc what u been through anything, at the end of the day if u make stupid decisions obviously bad things will happen in turn. Don't be a crackhead Legalizing drugs has a big impact on preventing gang violence. Most street feuds are based off drugs that are stolen, and since you can't contact the police to help you you have to get it back through violence, which in turn will escalate to full out beef that will take the lives of many innocents as well as criminals. If drugs are legal, instead you could just contact the police and they'd get your narcotics for you without violence being involved. The main counter argument is that it would sky rocket drug use. Idk if you don't go outside but anybody above the age of 10 with access to a phone can find a dealer within 30 minutes. Dealers are already in abundance.

"298","CMV: Peak oil and petroleum depletion are going to cause a rapid downfall of modern industrial society. This is unavoidable and we should be preparing for this much more than we currently are.","Simply put, there is no alternative to oil. Fossil fuels more generally are our most reliable source of energy, and at this point petroleum and its byproducts have seeped into literally every aspect of our lives. Our transportation runs on it, our clothes and drugs are made of it, our food is fertilized by it. Even the technologies we use to manage the side effects of its use (air conditioning in places that have become unliveably hot, powered irrigation, genetic modification) rely on it. The rapid ballooning of both our population and societal complexity is thanks entirely to fossil fuels.&#x200B;The problem, of course, is that they are limited, and quickly running out. Oil will be done sometime around 2050, with gas and coal not too far behind. The problems will start far before then. As the easily extracted stuff runs out, it takes more oil to get more oil, causing prices to skyrocket (this is obviously happening already). Our global economies will be crippled as literally everything becomes more expensive, and some things (like modes of transportation) become functionally useless. We can't technology our way out of this one, as all of this technology takes the insane amounts of energy that fossil fuels currently provide (eg. a nuclear reactor take like a decade to set up and is made possible only due to fossil fuels).  Prices are heavily subsidized, only kicking the can further down the road and steepening the fall. &#x200B;It seems to me contending with such ideas is too existentially horrifying, and so we just... aren't? As much as global warming and ecosphere collapse are scary, they potentially could be mitigated assuming cheap energy and physical resources like we have now, but those are running out so this just becomes a multiplier for issues that we're already contending with (food production, war, climate change etc). We SHOULD have started making plans to get off fossil fuels decades ago, but I strongly believe it  is now too late; we simply do not have the infrastructure set up to deal with a post-carbon future.&#x200B;Some quick anticipatory counterpoints:1. Yes, I know we are quickly developing technologies that are phasing out oil and other FFs. And honestly, if we were really committed to it, we could almost certainly set ourselves up to be okay at least energy-wise. However, it seems we have no interest in doing so in any serious way (probably due to fossil fuel lobbying as well as laziness), and even if we did that would only address the energy component (wouldn't solve petroleum based materials that we're also dependent on).2. ""We will never run out of oil because supply and demand! It'll just become too expensive and no longer economically viable, and economies will adjust!"" This Econ 101 talking point drives me insane. Yeah, no kidding, that's the problem. It still takes energy and materials to adjust, and without fossil fuels we have neither in adequate supply. I suppose you're correct though if by ""adjust"" you mean a general collapse of global society, massive population decline and a technological return to the 1700s, then yeah.3. ""Ok, so what do you suggest, doomer?"" You got me here, I think it's too late unless we make a massive global effort starting yesterday, probably including a lot of wealth redistribution, socialization of economies, and individual austerity. However, as material conditions get worse, I expect the opposite to happen as people get scared and resources dwindle. I have sort of made my peace with the global ""shittening"" to come, but I'm not going to lie, I would LOVE to be proven wrong.",""

"300","CMV: Militant progressivism has arguably done more for bolstering support of the radical right, socially right at least, than the actual right itself.","I don't write this to be antagonistic, I just want to see if there's any legitimate criticisms to what I have to say, as I can acknowledge my opinion might be biased as I don't have the entire view of everything. I'm only 19, and most of the political discourse I witness is online.Effectively, from my perspective, I genuinely feel as if the more militant sides of the left have done more to push moderates away from the left and fostered the conditions for the radicalization of more individuals. By the militant left, I guess the best term I can think of is an archetypical SJW, as dated as that term is.It's a phenomena I've observed since I want to say 2016? When this whole surge of ""Fuck men"" and ""Fuck white men"" in particular started to really gain traction, at least online. In general, I feel as if this alienation and outcasting of this particular demographic led to a massive shift of young white men who aligned as moderate democrats feeling attacked and pushed away, and then beginning to align themselves more with the Republican party. I also feel as if this incident led to more young white men falling prey to radicalization by the right along with fostering the conditions for Trump to be elected. Now, I'm not white myself, I'm Asian-American, but it's a trend I noticed between some of my friends back in highschool and online. The more radical and misandrist elements of the fourth wave feminist movement is something that I feel also helped contribute to the rise of incel culture, as it's literally a trap I fell into in my teenage years. While I didn't fall into the rabbit hole of getting radicalized by the right, some of the people I know did end up facing such a circumstance.Today it's still something that can be observed with cancel culture. In general, I feel as if most people really only give a shit about stuff they're interested in and things that play a factor in their everyday lives. It's why white suburban kids, while they know racism is bad, don't give a ton of a shit as it's not a factor. It's why white suburban kids are more focused on free healthcare or free college education, as that does play a factor in their lives. So when things that they're into are trying to get cancelled or boycotted, sometimes for an unjust reason, they develop a disdain for the collective attacking their interest, and shift away from their agenda, leading them more to the right. The most recent example of this that comes to mind is with the Hogwarts game, I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if more people developed more bigoted views and shifted towards the right because of what's happening.Anyways, I don't know if this is really a compelling argument, but I hope that my viewpoint is at least effectively communicated so I can see what arguments against what I've said can be made so I can learn more.

"301","CMV: Princess Morbucks never wanted to be a Powerpuff Girl. Also, Buttercup is the one to blame for her descent into a life of villainy."," Original PPG 1998 series.If Princess *really* wanted to be a PPG, she would have tried to learn how to fight crime effectively. It's not like her resources are as finite as the next guy. She easily could have used money to learn.Instead, it's pretty clear she wanted the glory that the PPG had. She was jealous that everyone loved them. She wanted to be loved and to be the center of attention just like they were, but didn't want to work towards it, because, let's be honest, she got everything she wanted just for the taking and not for the working.Part of the blame is on her parents, who never had the gonads and strife to say no to her. The PPG saying ""no you can't be one of us"" was probably the first time in her entire life she was ever told ""no,"" and she stayed very bitter about that to the point where it drove her to a life of villainy.Being rejected, I don't think was what drove her to be a villain. Rather, it was Buttercup's hostile response to her wanting to be a PPG kind of added to her bitterness.In her debut episode, ""Stuck up, up and away,"" Blossom was diplomatic and tried to explain to her nicely, ""you don't have superpowers and you're not cut out for this,"" whereas Buttercup was more like ""no you can't be one of us, and fuck you for even asking,"" even coming close to hitting Princess on two occasions just for wanting to be a PPG (only to be stopped by Blossom and her diplomacy) and when she finally did throw punches, she got thrashed (like she deserved to be, tbh)In a later episode, ""Bought and Scold,"" we see Daddy Morbucks buy Townsville for Princess, making her the Mayor.

"302","cmv: Women are too sexual AND they are also not respected enough.","So, let me explain. I am against the current oversexualization of women and yet I also disagree with the usual other side of the argument. I look right and I see feminists (usually women) claiming that women being sexual like this is strong, empowering and beautiful.I look left and I see (usually men) saying that when women express their sexual self outwardly in any way, they are less valuable. It is not always being said as directly and clearly as this, but it is often implied in indirect comments. Wether it’s about OF, women having multiple current or past sexual partners, clothing, dances, pictures, social media, etc.Both are feeding off of each other and making the other more an more extreme. Both, in my opinion, are wrong.(Disclaimer: I will be generalizing for the sake of the argument and being efficient): Men consume media of women being sexual. They are strongly attracted to them, and yet they also do not respect them for it. They’re porn watchers. And yet some of them will harshly judge women working in the sex industry, using only fans, or even just being sexy in general. Hate them, spit on them, laugh at them. I remember when that one porn star, Lana Rhoades I think, announced that she was pregnant. It’s like men could not grasp the sole concept of a sexual woman doing something… human? I’ve never seen any drama when the men porn stars have kids. The women they want to date, the one they see as the respectable ones, the less outwardly sexual they are, the better she is. Madonna-whore complex.It makes women sexualize themselves even more. First because, well, there is a public and it pays, A LOT, but also because I believe they want to prove the point that women should be allowed to be sexual and still be considered as respectable HUMANS. Therefore, they are not trying to hide their sexual self anymore and maybe exposing it a little too much as a protest.  Which isn’t wrong, but it transformed into an oversexualization that is so so detrimental. Today, it feels like just the word woman implies sex, for both men and women. Sure, being sexual can be empowering, but it stops being empowering when it is the only power you have and the most important one as a woman. Just look at male vs female celebrities, singers, artists, clothing, advertisement, media, movies, sexual harassment, how little underage girls on tiktok are trying to be sexy. Women around us are people that have ambitions, passions, active roles in society, complex inner world and free will. And they are sexual. Sex is an aspect of their lives but it should not be the first thing they are and it does not define them. Basically, kind of like, men.Thanks if you read this whole thing.

"304","CMV: Harry Potter is not Anti-Semitic","EDIT\*: It seems as though Reddit was suffering some sort of outage, or something, and despite replying to literally every post in this thread, none of them went through. I replied to one post for the second time as I saw a potential there. For the rest of the comments, I am not initially ignoring you. I do not have the mental energy to reformulate my thoughts to respond to everything again. If you've bene left hanging that's because I saw the conversation becoming cyclical and that it was unnecessary to comment again.\*This is the only thing I've edited, the OP remains otherwise the same.I want to start by saying I'm not trying to shill Hogwart's Legacy, nor am I condoning anything about the franchise. I think J. K. Rowling has some very hurtful opinions and harmful actions. I do not think that people should award her with any royalties. I will also say that while I consider myself agnostic, I was raised in a Jewish family. I'm culturally Jewish and I've never hidden that fact.I'm using a throwaway because I'm afraid of what the replies might be, specifically those on both sides of the aisle, and how this post might attract unwanted attention and DMs. I don't want that tied to my real account.But it's been bothering me that a huge aspect of the rhetoric surrounding the game and franchise has revolved around it's anti-Semitism. It bothers me because it all feels to me as though people internalized anti-Semitism so much that they are *looking* for things that might be anti-Semitic out of context. And I want to understand if maybe I'm not picking up on things that I should be. Let me outline my thoughts on all the various controversies related to anti-Semitism and the game. I'll start with the easier ones and work my way up.**The ""shofar"" found in Hogwart's Legacy**So, [this image](https://preview.redd.it/the-wizard-game-isnt-bigoted-anyway-heres-a-goblin-shofar-v0-i3pwlkr6y1ha1.jpg?auto=webp&s=1007be0b40b9a2d399ee139409b8f6d8793c13cf) has been circling around. In the context of the game, it's a Goblin artifact that I believe you find while playing. A lot of the commentary has pointed to this saying it's a shofar and therefore further links the goblins to anti-Semitic commentary. But I have an issue with this. It's not a [shofar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shofar). The shape is wrong and it's painted. I can understand thinking it's one on first glance, but looking at it with attention to detail made me realize it really wasn't one.**The instrument's description - cheese & year**Following that paragraph, a lot of people continue to point out that the flavor text indicates further anti-Semitic notions because non-kosher cheese was used to stuff the ""annoying"" instrument and that it was used during a year (1612) that corresponds to a pogrom. For starters, a *lot* of cheese from that time period wouldn't be kosher. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/10yxqm8/comment/j81he9u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) goes into a better reason why than I could ever muster on my own. I believe the specificity of the cheese is less about being anti-Semitic and more about using a funny word for a mediocre joke. Though, that's obviously more of an opinion than a fact.As for the year, the comment also covers it as well. However, I wanted to add that the pogrom that people are specifically pointing out is the [Fettmilch Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Judengasse#The_Fettmilch_Uprising). Now, yes, the year 1612 does correlate to the specific pogrom, however the actual events did not occur until 1614. Despite this, I think it's important to note that pogroms happen so often that they became a [defined word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom) in order to easily explain what happened. If you were to use *any* year for the referenced Goblin rebellion, the likelihood of it occurring in a year in which a pogrom did is statistically likely.**Gringott's Bank**I'm uncertain if there was a controversy when the film was first released, but I'm seeing it surface now. In the establishing shot for the bank, [a six-pointed star](https://eder6ypjvgv.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5c58449b104bgringotts.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&resize=1280%2C650&ssl=1) can be seen on the building's floor. Much of the commentary uses this, alongside the general notion that goblins are stereotyped to be Jewish \[which I'll cover later\], as definitive proof.The first point against this is that the building they used was *built* with that star and it wasn't added in while editing the film. Now, obviously, they could have edited it out if it was an issue, right? *But why would they*? My second point is that *it's not even a Star of David*. Ignoring the star's history for a moment, a [Star of David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David) is a hexagram. It is *not*a filled in star. The only example of that star ever being filled in is on the article I listed and is for the Israeli Airforce. I can't find a reason for why it's filled in there, but my *assumption* is that it's filled in for visibility sake. Which leads me to what the star actually is, the original design for the [Commonwealth Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Star) of Australia. This is important and not just some tangential, unrelated design, because the building the bank was filmed in was the [Australian Embassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commission_of_Australia,_London) in London. Therefore, the star *wasn't* meant to be a Star of David and therefore *isn't* one and no one would have seen that thinking it was.**Blood Libel**One of the more major arguments for anti-Semitism is the concept of [Blood Libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel). The [plot of the story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts_Legacy#Setting_and_characters) involves a goblin looking to use a rebellion as a way to harness ancient magics, which needs to be stolen from the protagonist, who had already learned the magic. From what I understand of the plot, the goblin leader doesn't actually care about goblin rights, but is instead your typical, trope-y villain looking to wield this powerful magic to rule the world. In addition, from what I've read from people who actually played the game, a lot of the goblins don't agree with what the leader is doing. You aren't quashing a rebellion; you're fighting a villain and his cronies.To me, this is less about an anti-Semitic canard, and more about what pretty much every single fantasy story ever follows. Bad guy wants power, protagonist has power, bad guy does what he can to steal power from protagonist. But, it's hard to source this section without actually playing the game, which I'm not doing because I don't want to monetarily support it.**Goblins are Stand-Ins for Jews**This is perhaps the point where I start to doubt myself. [A propaganda film's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eternal_Jew_%28film%29) poster looks very similar to popular depictions of goblins. Stereotypes include: hooked nose, short stature, and money-hoarding, including the extreme notion of ""Jews controlling the world"". If you look at Harry Potter's goblins, they have the hooked noses, are obviously short, and they run the magical world's banks.But, my confidence wavers here. Why are people thinking of Jews when they see goblins instead of seeing goblins as the mythological creatures they are? I understand that anti-Semites have used goblin imagery as a way to depict Jews, but does that mean any depiction of goblins is automatically anti-Semitic? Much like the [swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika#Association_with_Nazism) and [Pepe the Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog#Appropriation_by_the_alt-right), this iconography has been co-opted by horrible people. But does that mean that's the only way to interpret it? I don't think so.**Conclusion**I don't see the anti-Semitism. Maybe it's because I grew up in an area that wasn't anti-Semitic and didn't have to suffer through that sort of abuse. Maybe I just don't understand the ways in which people hate and how they express it in sometimes subtle, sometimes overt ways.But when I look at what people are pointing out, all I see is a series of coincidences, misinformation, and the internalized anti-Semitism being used as a scapegoat to further the anti-JKR sentiment.

Maybe *I'm* the one who has internalized the hate and is unwittingly stumbling past something so obvious.

"305","Cmv: Political assassinations should be legalized as a way to protect the rights of an individual from exploitation by politicians","Okay, politicans such as those in elected and appointed offices often get away with abuses of power because they view themselves as untouchable. So why not make sure that political assassination by the common man against any poltician is legalized as a final safeguard with all elected and appointed governmental officals forfieting their rights for protection under the law (that also means no hiring bodyguards until you complete your term or resign) , allowing for anyone to kill them for any reason at all?  This would prevent the common man from being exploited as those elected officals will have to consider their policies carefully to lower their chances of death and make sure they fear for their lives while considering policy and drafting laws, allowing the individual to have a final redress if all methods that do not end with the death of a elected or appointed governmental offical fails.Make it such that those elected and appointed governmental officals  remember this. They are our slaves whose job is to keep the government and the infrastructure running. We, the governed have the right to dispose of them in any ways possible, by hook or by crook if they displease us.Edit: Okay, that blew up. Thanks for your views  on why political assassinations should not be legalized",""
"306","CMV: Rather than encouraging the development of ""healthy"" or ""alternative"" masculinity, we would be better off encouraging men and boys to let go of masculinity altogether.","I'm a man in my late 20s, with my first child (a boy) on the way, so I've been thinking about masculinity a lot. I have found this idea compelling, and want to see what others think.This breaks down into several parts, which I present in order from those that I am most solidly convinced of, to those that I am least certain about. **Premise 1: Traditional Masculinity Harms Boys and Men:**Traditional masculinity establishes a set of strict expectations that boys and men must live up to in order to ""be a man."" It demands that men and boys: * Never show weakness (including displays of emotion or vulnerability) * Never show signs of femininity (defined to include behaviors perceived as ""gay"") * Gain status and esteem through success and achievement, not through relationships * Engage in risk-taking and violent behaviorTraditional masculinity also proscribes men's family role: provider, protector, but not nurturing or caring. This puts men in a box, constraining their personalities and forcing them to strictly police their own behavior. Those that are not able to or choose not to (basically everybody at some point) have their behavior policed by other men, often violently. Men are discouraged from building close and vulnerable relationships (with friends, romantic partners, children, etc), resulting in incredible isolation and loneliness. When men are not able to live up to the provider/protector role (as is becoming increasingly the case), they often struggle to cope, leading to increases in substance abuse and suicide. I could go on and on here, but the negative consequences feel pretty self-evident to me. Happy to do into further detail on specific points in the comments. (Obviously traditional masculinity is an absolute horror show for women, and I'm not really including that here because I don't think it's up for discussion.)**Premise 2: Pursuing ""Healthy/Alternative"" Masculinity is a Flawed Project:**Once we've dispensed with traditional masculinity, the desire to define a healthy and ethical alternative makes sense, but is a fundamentally flawed project. What exactly is it that we want a good or ethical man to do/be that is different from what we would hope all good and ethical people would do/be, regardless of gender? This came into focus for me when we found out that our baby was going to be a boy (or at least AMAB), and I realized that there was nothing that I wanted for him, or for him to be, that would have been different if I had just been told he was going to be a girl.In addition, this still locks us into a paradigm where we are telling men and boys that their is an ideal of a ""good man"" that they must live up to, we've just changed the definition of ""good man."" Even if we defined a healthy or ethical masculinity that we were all happy with, defining gender roles remains harmful on both an individual and societal level. For example, let's say that ""being a bold leader and standing up for what is right"" is part of our healthy masculinity, as this can certainly be a good and ethical thing to do. Individually, we are pushing people into boxes that may not fit their personality, creating distress. It may not be in my nature to be a bold leader, and being a bold leader isn't the only way to do good in the world. But under this regime of healthy masculinity, I am made to feel less of a man for not being a bold leader, negatively impacting my self-esteem and self-worth. On a societal level, by telling kids that bold leadership and standing up for what is right is a masculine trait, we are discouraging girls from developing this trait, and potentially missing out on a bunch of incredible female bold leaders who will stand up for what is right. **Premise 3: ""Letting Go"" of Masculinity is Much Less Radical Than It May First Sound:**I'm not asking anyone to change their gender identity, or their name, or their pronouns. This is not so much about *changing* an identity, but simply relaxing our grip on gender and masculinity as *absolutely central* to our identity. We all have many many different components of our identity, some of which we inherit from our parents, family, or community, and some of which are unique to ourselves. There is no reason that our male gender, our masculinity, needs to be the central and most important feature of our identity. We can still be men/boys, and just not let that matter very much to us. We can usher masculinity off of center stage and let the other parts of ourselves come to the fore, no longer constrained by whether or not they fit a masculine ideal. We can be boys/men without subscribing to the socially constructed masculine ideal (or creating a new one to replace it). After a lot of reading and thought, I also think this idea is trans-inclusive. Everything I'm saying here is compatible with the idea that people may want to change their bodies or manner of self-expression in order to more fully be themselves. I am very happy in my male body, and that has nothing to do with trying to live up to the socially constructed masculine ideal. Similarly, a trans-man or transmasc person can alter their body or manner of expression to more fully be themselves, without subscribing to a socially constructed masculine ideal. Indeed, I think a world in which we have let go of masculinity is a world in which there is a lot less policing of gender and gendered expression in general, and therefore a safer and healthier world for trans people. **Premise 4: Men and Boys Will Be More Receptive to the Idea of Letting Go of Masculinity Than to the Current ""Toxic vs. Healthy"" Masculinity Framing:** ""Toxic masculinity"" has failed as a way to reach men and boys and encourage them to change (I know that this may not be the only goal of this discourse, but it's the one I'm focusing on here). The idea behind it makes sense: by specifically defining some parts of masculinity as toxic, you are saying that not all of it is, and encouraging people away from the toxic bits.But this has failed as a strategy for messaging and encouraging change. It has been widely perceived as an attack, as saying that *men* are inherently toxic (or as received by the individual, ""I am inherently toxic""). Psychologically, most people seem wired to immediately reject being told that they are bad, and so this has garnered a primarily defensive/backlash response. Encouraging men and boys to loosen their grip on masculinity a little is a softer ask at first, and it can happen gradually. It appeals to self-interest: trying to live up to the masculine ideal is exhausting (see Premise 1), and I think that many men and boys will react to the idea that they can put that burden down with a glimmer of relief and hope. That glimmer of relief and hope is a foot in the door (the same door that gets slammed and locked when someone feels that they are being attacked). Once a man has begun experimenting with the idea of de-centering masculinity as part of his his identity, he will become much more receptive to understanding all of the ways that traditional masculinity harms women, harms other men, and harms himself. He has some distance from the idea of masculinity, so he no longer feels these truths as a personal attack. Instead, he sees them as a reason to change, a reason to keep walking down the road of being himself, instead of being a man. In time, this allows him to understand and take accountability for the harm he has done to those around him in the name of upholding his masculinity, and begin the process of making amends/healing.I don't think that this is some sort of silver bullet that reaches every man, especially those that have already spent a lifetime solidifying manhood as the core of their identity, but I do think that it will reach a lot *more* men than the current ""toxic masculinity"" discourse.",""
"307","CMV: Lend Lease to the Soviet Union during WWII was a massive mistake","I believe that lend lease to the USSR was a massive mistake that led directly to the cold war and all the issues associated with it. It allowed the USSR to conquer and subjugate eastern Europe and Manchuria and allowed them to prop up communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe, China and North Korea.To change my view you'd have to convince me that 1. The soviet union would have completely collapsed and fallen to the Nazis if not for lend lease aid. And/or 2. The rapid and success Soviet offensives of 1944 and 1945 would have been possible without lend lease aid. Bonus 3. There were not any better uses of that aid.1. My argument is that the USSR wouldn't have collapsed if lend lease didn't occur. In 1941, the USSR had very little aid given to it yet they held the Nazi offensive off. Leningrad, Stalingrad and Moscow all were not taken. And even if they were taken sometime during 1942 or 1943, the Germans would have still had to expend massive resources doing it and it still wouldn't have ended the war. The soviets would have just retreated further back into Russia, extending German supply lines even more and waging even more guerilla warfare. 2. The supply of vitals materials like trucks, rubber, high octane oil, boots, ammunitions, planes etc. were essential for the success of an offensive. A defensive war could still have been wages without them, but a offensive war - impossible. Without the 400,000 trucks given to them by the US, there's absolutely no way the soviets advance to Berlin before the US does. If the USSR is still bogged down in Russia in 1944, or even 1945, that gives the US time to either advance up through the balkans and liberate eastern europe or go right for Berlin and end the war but secure the independence of eastern europe in the peace settlement. 3. There were other uses of this aid. The US could've used this aid to build even larger American armies or better equip the British or free French. The massive British colonial empire could've been equipped and put into the field against the germans (to an even larger degree than it was). Foodstuffs could have been given alleviate the Bengal famine. Nationalist China could've also been given much more equipment which would've made their position against the Chinese communists much stronger. Without lend lease to the USSR, we might have seen a free and independent Eastern Europe, a non-communist China and a free and united Korea. The USSR would have been significantly weakened without all the supplies from lend lease and the industrial equipped looted from East Germany post war, and they would've been completely unable to compete with the west economically or militarily, ushering in an era of peace.",""
"308","CMV: ""Folx"" is an absurd word to use because it does not follow the internal reasoning of those who wish to make language more conclusive.","I don't necessarily disagree with the changing of some words to better suit modern mentalities. I don't positively agree/care, but I am not actively against it. If that is what people want to do, so be it.If people think that a word like ""fisherman"" is sexist, and rather use the word ""fisher,"" that's fine with me. I can clearly see that the former word includes a specific gender, and so I can sympathize with the argument that it excludes women, making the latter word more preferable. I can understand how some people write the word ""womyn"" instead of ""women."" The latter word makes it sound like the female gender is a subdivision of the male gender. I get it. I admit that I think it is a bit silly, but I get it. It makes sense.""Folx"" as a replacement for ""folks"" does not make sense. It is ridiculous. ""Folk"" a is gender neutral word. It has always been a gender neutral word. In fact, it is perhaps the only satisfying gender neutral word to refer to a group of people. Now, you might say, ""well, maybe the word folk derives from a masculine word of different language."" True, English is a bit of an exception in language because we don't have genders. Maybe folk is inherently masculine or feminine. [Well, I checked.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/folk#English) Folk and its alternates are neuter in German, Swedish, Danish, Dutch. The Proto-Germanic folk is neuter. This word has been neuter for thousands of years in many languages. So, even in a gendered language, that word is still genderless. If your desire is make a word that is inclusive by its very nature, then folk is already an appropriate word to use. Replacing that word with another is fixing something that is not broken.There is another use of the word to consider. I looked up the dictionary definition of the word, and found that it is a word to describe excluded groups in society. Okay, fair enough, but if these people are excluded, why reinforces that exclusion? Isn't creating a word to highlight the exclusion keeping the exclusion alive? I don't know about you, but I always include LGBT, minority, disabled, etc. people as part of the folk. *Folk*lore is full of people that find themselves more on the exclude side. It does not make sense to me to use a word which differs them from the rest of society. I could be mistaken, but isn't the desire of excluded people to break down that exclusion, not prop it up? Also, and this perhaps anecdotal, I also see people use the word ""folx"" when referring to non-excluded people. If the purpose is to create a word that differentiates people, why use that word in a non-differentiating way? Maybe they are trying to come up with a word that encompasses all people. But that word already exists; that word is ""folks.""In summary, this is not an argument against the use of neo-words in general. Most other neo-words make sense. ""Folx"" does not makes sense. If your goal is inclusion, it makes no sense to use that word. The change my view, I kindly ask to you try and make sense of it. By sense, I mean something that is logically consistent with the beliefs of the people using the word. Saying something like, ""you can use whatever word you want,"" is not a convincing argument because it is not a rational one. I can could call a dog a microwave, and that would satisfy your claim of me being able to use whatever word I want. However, that only leads to further absurdity. I am trying to limit the absurdity.",""
"309","CMV: CRT technology should be brought back, albeit in forms that cater to modern graphics and flat screens.","I remember back in the late 90s towards the mid 2000s that CRT and cable tv were pretty much commonplace in the United States and other developed countries. In those years of having being brought up in the world of CRTs', I've realized two things: 1.) authenticity to the sound quality | 2.) a lot less delay in motion pictures for video games and tv shows.I know I'm sounding a bit unscientific here, but I just feel like there was a lot more ""soul"" to the games I've played and to the shows I've watched on CRTs. It felt like every single moment was truly valuable while sitting on my couch. By comparison, watching things and playing games on LED and LCDs feel so soulless/inauthentic that I truly don't feel like I'm living in the moment when viewing those kinds of newer screens. I've done some research on why I feel this way, and there are actual legitimate explanations as to why this is the case. For my first aforementioned point about the sound, it turns out that CRTs used analog technology to produce sound, which made voices and sound effects have an almost vinyl-quality to them. With regard to less input lag, which is my second point, certain motions and actions performed in video games and shows had this almost buttery smooth feel to them.It's hard to deny the many positives that CRT tech had to offer at the time, and I really do feel like the abandonment of such technology came at the cost of lower quality picture and sound. I really to believe CRT tech should be incorporated in a way that allows the tv to handle the very top of the line graphics of movies and video games of today. I believe this feat is quite possible if only CRT hardware could somehow be minimized and fit into flat screens.Do y'all agree with my view that CRT tech should be brought back to restore the ""soul"" of television? Or   is there another way to bring back that kind of authenticity? And moreover, is it even possible to minimize and improve CRT tech so that the flat screen TV surround it can handle modern AAA title games and big budget movies?

"311","CMV: People need to stop equating US secession movements with calls for a civil war. Those are two very different things","Edit 1 reminder: The focus of this thread is not on the original civil war. It is on modern secessionist movements, and whether advocates thereof are generally in favor of a second war. The references to the first war are merely to demonstrate that the original secessionists weren't necessarily in favor of violence, and using that merely as an analogy to the present. Read at the bottom what I am willing to change my mind on.Edit 2: I conceded that it might be best for some people in favor of a civil war to merely advocate for secession as openly advocating for a civil war can get you fined or jailed, and that then media making assuming that they might support a war based on their background might be reasonable, even if they are not outspoken about a civil war specifically.Edit 3: I wanted to clarify that I am not sympathetic to the Confederacy. I was simply trying to make a case about American secessionist movements in general using an example familiar to people. Sorry if I came across the wrong way. I'm gong to bed now, so I'll try to continue the conversation in the morning. Thanks for your time!There has been some commotion in recent years when various groups have called for secession (a national divorce, as MTG recently put it), and people are going on and on in the media and online about how people who want to secede necessarily want a repeat of the civil war. This is an easy way to avoid talking about the merits of secessionist movements, as well as a clear strawman that people really ought to get over by now.First of all, why did the last civil war happen, exactly? Secession might have been about slavery, but that is not why the war started. The war started entirely because Lincoln refused to believe in a peaceful resolution. The South tried to send diplomats in the first few months to work out the new relationship between the two countries, but Lincoln refused to receive them. He then sent troops to an outpost located in Confederate territory, which was clearly trying to start a war.  It can be said then that if we had a president who was less trigger happy, war may very well have been avoided entirety— secession could theoretically have been peaceful, but Lincoln didn't want it to be, so it wasn't.What about today? Even if you think the war against the South was justified for the purpose of liberating the slaves, that isn't really an argument about the merits of secession in general. Furthermore, pretend for the sake of argument that the South hadn't differed from the North on the issue of slavery, but something else that was relatively benign. Would the North still have been justified invading the south merely for union's sake, particularly in light of the devastation that it brought to the region? I'd argue that if slavery is taken out of the equation, the Civil War would no longer be a moral cause.Rather than simply being a musing upon alternate history, this is essentially the situation we are in today. Take a state like Alaska, for instance, which has had a small independence movement stretching back decades now. Alaska is a far of region of the country, and in many ways is distinct from the lower 48 states. If Alaska voted overwhelmingly to leave the union, what moral right would the US have to stop them? Separatists in Alaska (and other states) are largely peaceful, after all. A war against a seceding Alaska for union's sake, especially without a moral justification for it on the part of the US, would be highly unlikely, especially in the modern times. As such, to say that support for the secession amounts to any support at all for a war preventing it is disingenuous.Also, realistic separatists understand that they will not be able to defeat the entire rest of the country. If a state did try to secede, they would not resort to a war to secure their independence because to do so would be obviously suicidal. Even if half the states seceded together, the cost of war would be too great to fight, and for what? Glory? Perhaps if the union started the war against the secessionists they seceding states might fight a defensive war, but to think that it is the secessionists who want the war that would devastate their homeland and probably result in their own defeat is insanity. (I know that there are a few fringe groups that advocate for war, but those are a mere fraction of the people who have ever thought to themselves that secession might be a good idea. They also are incredibly unrealistic).Furthermore, many people who do fear that a civil war might be upcoming view secession as a way to reduce tensions, not enflame them. If different parts of the country cannot get along amicably and are rapidly growing agitated with each other, then it stands to reason that letting them go their own ways might reduce tensions, as the politics of one region of the country will not enflame tensions with another as easily. You might disagree with whether this would be successful or not, but once again, to claim that people who view this as the peaceful way out are the true warmongers is a strawman of enormous proportions.I don't care in general whether you support or oppose secession, and that is not what this CMV is about. In order to change my view, you would need to provide some evidence that the characterization of secessionists as warmongers is not generally a strawman. I don't understand why people keep equating the two when they are fundamentally different; it seems wrong to me.",""

In fact, I personally know of in-laws who have worked their asses off to get master's and doctorate's degrees to get a high paying job,in order to be able to live in a great neighborhood.However, for the past few decades, many homeowners in places which used to be quite affordable in the USA, have voted for local politicians who have simply made zoning laws a lot more restrictive when it comes to creating mixed income communities and affordable public and private housing for both the renters and buyers market.  A lot of the fear has to do with the perceived possible increase in crime and fundamental change their community. Also, a drop in their property values is a major reason too. Frankly, I believe that this mindset is almost like gambling your own money with chips and cards but only with houses. First of all, in the world of gambling, there is simply no guarantee that anything will happen; and there certainly is no guarantee that houses in a given community will increase in price in the next 5 years or will noticably be higher than the price you paid for when they earned and bought their houses. Like damn... if you already paid up the mortgage or if you just straight up bought the house, why would you want to sell the house and move somewhere else, and buy another home? Seriously, you already have a permanent place to live without having to make major monthly payments anymore, like the mortgage. Though, property taxes,utilities, and insurance must still be paid. Anyways,those costs are really nothing compared to the amount you used to pay for the monthly mortgage. In addition, your family could just keep saving lots of money each month since a major monthly cost, like mortgage, is now gone.  What could possibly go wrong with just loosening up permiting and zoning laws so that young people and minorities have an affordable nice place to live? All that they are looking for is a home that they can live in dignity,instead of living in their parents' house for the rest of their lives, or living out on the streets. In fact, I'd argue bringing in people from more walks of life just adds to your community. For this reason, I want to politely say without attacking your character, "" Fuck you."" I truly believe America would be a better place to live if NIMBYs have not butted in a lot of the major affordable public and private housing projects for the past decade or two.With my short rant in the previous paragraph out of the way, I would like to get some insights as to whether NIMBYs should be held the most accountable for the housing affordability crisis. And, if this is true or not, what viable solutions are there to make housing affordable permantly and not subject to outside market forces( good and bad economic cycles)?",""

"319","CMV: Most people have children for selfish reasons","I have not seen any statistical data on this so if you know of anything trustworthy, please share.I would really like for my view to be changed but I feel like this is something inherent to human nature and I can't let up. Most people seem to have kids for the wrong reasons:1. **They want someone to care for them when they are old** meaning they have not planned far enough ahead past retirement and need to rely on kids for transportation and care (they are too insolvent to have kids AND live life)2. **They want others to care about them** It is easier to get a partner to care or even the government to care about you if you have kids. Because denying them essentials or pleasures will also impact their kids, people don't want to make the parent upset and in return also give this innocent kid a bad life.3. **They want to have the pregnancy experience** This applies mostly only to women and admittedly I would fall in this group. Pregnancy gives you new t\*ts and seems magical from the outside. It also tends to reduce cancers and mothers tend to live longer (even if that is only because their kids 'need' them?) So there are medical reasons it might seem good to have kids that have nothing to do with wanting to be a parent.4. **They want to pass on their genes** This would be closer to the male side of 'wanting the experience' as men are rumored to be biologically hardwired to want to spread their seed without any possible rationality behind what might happen next. Throw cleavage in their face and they practically become imbeciles. Again, it has absolutely nothing to do with parenthood; it can't: because it's immediate, disarming and short-sighted.I really feel that the way society is set up right now is making it so that health and livelihood in old age is dependent on having kids. Be it genetic or not, this just doesn't seem like a good premise for wanting to be a good parent. Anyone who has been parentified by their own parents can probably agree: who would actually be dumb enough to want to be forced to raise their own kids after raising their parents? No one asks to be born and parenting is a lifelong commitment to teaching and therefore being frustrated. Kids outsmart parents, go around their backs, and are generally born completely uncivilized. And on top of that, not only do you need to dedicate the rest of your life to teaching them but if you make a mistake it could get magnified over time.So if it is so hard to raise kids and takes away time from our ability to care for ourselves in old age, perhaps it is better to not try raising them at all: let society correct them or send them away to a private school. Because all the time wasted on trying to secure their wellbeing seems to eat away at time which could be spent making money to ensure the parents are safe and cared for in retirement instead of kids having to 'return the favor'No one asks to be born so no one should have to 'return the favor' of being raised",""
"320","CMV: The Liberal Arts/Humanities are Dying Out, as is Academia","I've always loved the humanities/arts and currently work as a teacher with the intent of potentially going into academia in the future (to become a professor or researcher). That being said, what I see happening in higher education right now, and the liberal arts, is nothing short of the goddamn apocalypse, and it has really dissuaded me from going and getting a Master's in the subject I intend to teach (English/Writing), despite encouragement from my mentors, former teachers, and family members.Everything from the declining enrollment of humanities/arts grads, to the pitiful wages of adjunct professors compared to their massive student debt balances, to their mistreatment and exploitation, to the ever increasing competition between individuals for a shrinking pool of available jobs, to the near-impossibility of gaining tenure, to the lackluster ROI for grad degrees and especially PhDs, makes studying the humanities at the graduate level effectively a dead end. A fool's errand.I adore the arts and humanities, and even went to art school to pursue my passions, but at some point reality hits and you have to put food on the table. I made one BIG mistake not focusing on $$$ in my undergrad years, and I don't want to make that same mistake again. Going into academia simply isn't worth it anymore, let alone studying the humanities/arts. The field is declining, if not already dead. Best alternative I got is becoming an entrepreneur or learning things on my own online.For fuck's sake people barely read or want to read anymore and all the money/prestige is in industry, because under capitalism, industry and R & D produce things of tangible economic value whereas academia is mostly theory with very little direct application, hence its lower economic value despite its higher subjective value for some people who appreciate the non-tangible benefits.AI is also creeping up on academia and the arts, and seems to be the final death blow, but then again I could be wrong.",""
"321","CMV: Forcing binary genders unto society is mental abuse, much like forcing religion unto a teen mind. A non-binary society should be the norm in our culture for our healthy coexistence","Gender is mannerisms, tone of voice, choice of attitude, attire, the way you behave.Being soft spoken, wearing a dress, using makeup is a social construct. Let's agree we are advanced apes. Let's agree that for millions of years, in a family dynamic, we've needed to look for food, take care of our offspring, and love each other to survive.That's all we are. We are made up of two biological SEXES. That is one has XY chromosomes, the other has XX chromosomes, and that's what makes an offspring occur. For millions of years, this dynamic has been compromised of two hunters and gatherers, protectors, nurturers. Both needing to act like savages for the survival of the family.Dresses, makeup, tone of voice, the way someone sways their body as they walk, was made up by society. Music choice, your facial expressions were made up by our society. Over time, there was a distinct binary separation that seemed to be along the lines of: ooga booga (chest stomp) I am MALE and then oooh I'm a dainty FEMALE because biologically one has bigger and stronger attributes which LED to adapting the typical binary attitudes. Culturally this became the norm and in our current ""civilized"" society we impart this attitudes towards our offspring out of tradition, and when somone steps out of line of this MADE UP expectations, society shuns these people and shames them.BUT GUESS WHAT. Some people said...wait. I can express myself however I want. Biologically I am not SUPPOSED to speak softly, or be submissive or be alpha or anything. We are individuals that are born with sexual organs that do not dictate behaviors. People realized that hey...I can be ""girly"" if I want to (as an XY chromosome being). I can wear baggy pants as a biological female. It's made up and people are starting to express themselves in ways which aren't traditional because we aren't confined in a box, especially a box dictated by ourrrr PAsToR or teH socieTY. We are individuals that can have families and be kind with our neighbors without dictating how I prefer them to act.Forcing genders unto people that aren't comfortable following that grid, is much like forcing a lion in a cage at a zoo, limiting their ability to fully express themselves.

"322","CMV: The Dark Ages were secular humanist propaganda and the myth needs to die out","First the definition. In amateur circles (basically the uneducated), the **Dark Ages** is simply the ill defined postulation that the Medieval period of Western Civilization was a 'dark time' of progress and/or stagnation. My view is that this is in fact just a pseudo-historical narrative driven by anti-Catholic bigots known as the 'Enlightenment' thinkers. Somehow this narrative caught on in some western countries (mainly anglo-saxon) due to their overrating of the Enlightenment, and while most modern empirical views have refuted this narrative it still lives in the primitive minds of the uneducated populace and/or secular propagandists. My view is that this ""Dark Age Myth"" needs to die out for the virtue of championing truth over propaganda, and the secularist agenda needs to be silenced as such.**THE ORIGINS**: As of 21st century scholars, the Dark Ages period is pretty much an obsolete term reserved for only specific geo-political periods...and even these are disputed. The original term 'Dark Ages' started from the poet Petrarch emphasized a 'light versus dark"" tradition in Italy over a previous century. Later Baronius, a Catholic historian, used it to lament limited sources from certain Medieval periods. However, these early suggestions are no longer relevant since plenty have sources have been found since then. Medieval written accounts have luckily been more and more rediscovered (and preserved) in the last few centuries. Today the list of available medieval sources (including from the early middle ages) is bigger than antiquity, which continuously weakens this initial proposition of the term.**THE REALITY**: However, starting around the 18th century came Reformist and humanist philosophies. During the Enlightenment Era, the secularist fanatics began to blather about Church  historically banning of reason, causing technological stagnation, political instability, and a bunch of other nonsense. These overgeneralized claims have also been largely refuted by the more accurate description of the Middle Ages being a long 1,000 year period with multiple ""renaissance"" type eras (i.e., Carolingian, 12th Century, Scholasticism). Some centuries were harder than others (7-8th, or 14-15th during Black Plague), but even these are disputed due to purely regional isolation. For example, some centuries were dark for say ethno-centric Britain (after loss of Rome lets say)...but other regions were simultaneously unaffected. So a lot of the Dark Age Myth also comes with down to national-centric bias rather than a holistic view of the period (does one region's calamity define an era?).So where does it come from? Ultimately, the Dark Age Myth is not real period based on history or empirical references. Its foundation is based on secular propaganda by humanist bigots like Voltaire, Thomas Jefferson, Edward Gibbon, etc.. Their progressive philosophies tried to champion their views as the dawn of a new ""enlightened age"" with their distortions of liberty, tolerance, reason, etc... and so naturally tried to paint what came before as evil. So they quickly did a bastardization of history were the rediscovery of some Greco-Roman ideas were seen as good, the Islamic/Scholastic Golden Ages were ignored,  the Church's actions was seen as bad, the Enlightenment actions (cough 'Reign of Terror' cough) was seen as good, and boom you get the Dark Age myths. A bit simplified, but the picture stands.So change my view by showing me that the Dark Ages were either: 1) Real, the period of the Middle Ages was a time of noticeable hostility towards social progress and/or stagnation for an entire 1000 year period,  or....2) There was no Dark Ages, but the myth was not the purposeful creation of anti-catholic bigots who were secularists/humanists. Or any other method you think will change my mind on this matter.Lastly, I'll quickly go over some predictable objections/responses:**The Renaissance:** The Italian Renaissance is sometimes seen as a justification for the end of the Dark Ages, as it led to the beginning of relearning knowledge from antiquity. Does this not prove the secularist point? Well, the overrated Renaissance itself is really just an ill defined period of mainly just focusing on new art designs that took inspiration from Greco-Roman works...but its overall significance on 'ending Dark Ages' in terms of stagnation is pretty much nonexistent. Plenty of Greco-Roman knowledge was already available both the Middle East, Eastern Roman Byzantine, and Islamic Spain. A lot of this knowledge had already made its way towards the academics of Europe by the 11th-12th century (during the time the so called 'Dark Ages' were taking place). The church was already reading Aristotle and using Greek Geometry to create advanced Architectural Cathedrals centuries before the Italian Renaissance. And again, the 'ill-defined' Renaissance itself is now being disputed as its start date is ever being pushed back. Some scholars point to certain arts early 14th century (one of the worst centuries of Medieval times) as already reaching Renaissance level craftsman many decades before. Which shows the ambiguity of how an 'arts period' can be considered an end of an era.**Religious War**: But the Dark Ages had the crusades, which were religious wars! Certainly that shows that period was ignorant, had Church totalitarianism and was an overall bloody uncivilized time right? Never mind that ultimately the Crusades had the unexpected benefit of bringing eastern knowledge back towards western countries, the Crusades really didn't play a major role in many calamities. The major fighting was in the East, which western countries were stable enough to send troops thousands of miles to a foreign land (a logistic feat in and of itself) and local attacks (i.e., Cathar Crusades) didn't have any major destabilizing effects on any nation. But ultimately using them as an example of a ""Dark Age"" is self-refuting since the times of the 'Enlightenment Age' were arguably just as (perhaps more) disastrous. Ironically, the wars of the 18th-19th century (7 Years War, French Revolution, Napoleonic Wars, etc..) made sure that the overall death count was just as high in 'Enlightened era"" than say the 30 Years War the century before. Bottom line is there is no objective sense to say the wars of religion in Middle Ages were ""Dark Times"" as opposed to any secularist wars during later times.**Technology/Fall of Rome**: But Rome fell and technology was lost, wasn't until modern times after we banished the Church authority that we recovered right? The exact fall of Rome is itself (to any modern Romanophile) a matter of dubious assertions and always has been. Plenty of the Middle Ages customs (i.e., Serfdom, structural decay, loss of certain ancient texts) were already happening in circulation even before the Fall of Western Rome (i.e., Diocletian reforms layed the groundwork for future Feudal laws, Britain was lost decades before the Fall of Rome already). But in general people don't want to say the Dark Ages were already happening while western Rome was still alive, so this makes the claim dubious. Plus while some tech was lost for many centuries, by High Middle Ages (11-13th century) many eras had largely recovered both demographically and economically. Improved economic output, agriculture innovations, better Metallurgy, establishing finance and university centers, etc... by High Middle Ages its hard to argue that Roman 1st-3rd century Gaul (France) was that much better than in the 12th century for example (for the average folk anyway). The fall of Rome (whenever it happened) had a sizable effect, but its biggest impact is regulated to the early Middle Ages. By later centuries its hard to argue that its effects were still having a huge impact when plenty of other things were taking place. Then of course there is the fact that Eastern Rome in Constantinople did survive, in a weakened state, but lasted for another 1000 years. In which it, alongside the Islamic Golden Age, would preserve and in some areas (i.e. Hellenic Classics, mathematical algebra) surpass ancient knowledge...all eventually reaching western countries in due time.",""
"323","CMV: Compromise between the pro-AI art and anti-AI art sides is impossible.","The pro and anti sides of the entire AI art debate have completely different view points and conflicting interests. They live in completely different worlds. I will not be talking about the monetary side of this that much because that’s a whole separate dumpster fire.# Analysis of both sides:* The Anti-AI side are usually artists big and small, their fans, and people who appreciates them as people.1. Art is very passion driven both as a hobby and job. A lot of artists places huge importance on the process of creating the artwork, finding it a satisfying, relaxing, or rewarding experience.2. Fans of artists who still sticks with them throughout this respects the talent(which I believe is only skill, the fans seeing great skill can only think of it as unattainable talent which is also seen on the pro-AI side) and care for the human touch.3. Artists values the skills(even if it’s still developing), dedication and creativity of themselves and their more honest peers.4. Many do not recognize AI art as Art for various reasons: No intention, no humanity, no effort, and disingenuous. The old accusations traditional artists had of digital artists such as “computer does it for you” actually holds true against AI “art”.5. The Anti-AI side often misunderstand how the AI works and doesn’t know that artstyles cannot be protected by copyright. I am category 2, the art fan and am firmly anti-AI, but they must understand that many of the AI generators do not physically store any of the images it scrapes. As a result, anything related to copyright will fall apart in court. They should know their enemy to fight it, although learning of its invulnerability would be horrifying.* The Pro-AI side are usually the AI developers, tech bros, apathetic normies, unskilled, the envious, and art hobbists. This side does not understand art and why people bother with the process instead of a quick end result.1. AI developers sees their softwares replacing artistic labor as the path to a post scarcity UBI utopia and does not care about any objections from artists. Stable Diffusion CEO views artists as mere tools, and one CEO ridiculously compared artists rejecting AI “artists” to medieval royalty keeping literacy away from the masses. The first is just idealistic and naive/neglecting negative consequences, the latter is downright insidious.2. Tech bros just drinks the Utopia kool aid and shares the same beliefs as the developers. They use excuses such as “Think of disabled people”(If you are not blind and can still use your hands you have no excuse. Only severely disabled people are completely barred from entering traditional art. This excuse generalizes and infantizes disabled people, making it just as ableist.) and believe they are on the “right side of history” just for following technology without question.3. Apathetic normies who aren’t artists just uses it for fun because of the novelty of new technology. Will turn to category 2, 4, or 5.4. The unskilled uses it as an attempt to stand on the same grounds as skilled artists they see online. They do not have an artistic mind, ignoring the current flaws of AI and only valuing the result. They see the ability to draw well as unattainable, locked by the wall of talent.5. This leads to the envious. They have the most insidious attitude of the Anti-AI side just behind the developers. Although some do not admit this, they are envious of the skills of artists, seeing them as oppressors in ivory towers using their talent as shackles to oppress them. They are bottom feeders using the opportunity to drag down demoralized smaller artists while acting like they are bombing the “oppressive” big galleries, which ironically is completely unaffected by this. They are the ones flinging slurs such as “inkcel” “drawpig” “drawslave” and make use of false accusations, self victimization, and projection(namely their envy) in an attempt to feel powerful.6. Art hobbists have no stake in this, so some of them like normies just play around with AI a bit.7. The Pro-AI side do not care or understand why artists are upset, and do not plan to learn why because the utopic end justifies the unethical means to them. Or because they believe all artists deserves nothing but misfortune.There is a complete and utterly conflicting difference in mindset, ideology, and values between the two sides. Anti-AI had everything at stake and already lost everything, Pro-AI has no stakes and everything to gain. Neither will give an inch, as Anti-AI holds onto what little they have and Pro-AI is unwilling to give back even a single bit of what it took.# ConflictsArtists don’t welcome AI “artists” into their communities for reasons besides them bringing in no skills to the table and refusing to learn how to draw because their values of speed, efficiency, instant gratification, and end result is incompatible with art and is the antithisis of what the human artists believes. I learned that the important of the artistic process very early on in my high school art classes, and those who didn’t learn quit the subject early on.Techbros and normies cannot grasp why artists prefer drawing over asking AI to do it for them because the concept of hard work being rewarding is completely alien to them. They only care for what is convenient, cheap and the end result. I started out with this mindset before I learned art in high school before I was taught how to think like an artist. As a result the pro-AI side sees no problem with blatant disrespect such as feeding the work of the late Korean illustrator Kim Jung Gi’s work into an AI, making models based off of SamDoesArts’ work to just to troll him, and eventually lead to the name calling from the envious types.On the flip side, the as the rage is continuously fueled by trolls and the Tech CEO’s’ complete disregard for human artists, the Anti-AI side began to lash out. They mass report open source AIs which doesn’t hurt the corporate backed ones which are the biggest threats, send death threats, harassing anyone for merely fooling around with AI generators, and bullying a young quadriplegic prompter off of an art subreddit(I do not condone, I am trying my hardest to not give into vengeful hatred and be the bigger man right now). Of course, the envious ones are relishing in all this as it fuels their sadism and gives them more excuses to be assholes.# ConclusionIn my opinion People only valuing the result above all else shouldn’t be involved in art communities the same way sadists and psychopaths should never become therapists and why blind people should never drive. I know this comparison is extreme, but it gets the point across.The fact that the two sides lives in completely different worlds is why compromise is impossible, because the goals and mindset of the two sides are fundamentally incompatible and opposing like oil and water, night and day. I used to believe in compromise before I heard the words of careless and malicious tech CEOs talking down on artists, the envious, unskilled, and trolls going around saying artists deserved everything misfortune that AI brought upon them. Looking at my side, there was a case of ableism as a young quadriplegic prompter was bullied off of an art subreddit, which again I do not condone.I had no choice but to pick a side, because I won’t tolerate plain disrespect towards artists, whether they are teachers, hobbyists, industry workers, students or learners.Explain to me why compromise is still possible.Edit: My compromise is for the two to stay separate, not be one in the same. The AI bros should get their own sites to share their manufactures instead of flooding Deviantart and Artstation. The two communities are just too different in values to get along in the same place. However, the Pro-AI side compares this to racial segregation so this isn’t possible.Edit 2: Another compromise is to legally require AI generated images to be labeled as such via a watermark forced onto it by the generators like what China’s doing. Both of these ensure human made art is identifiable instead of being drowned out completely by the oversaturation of pretty images on the internet this has already brought.I just want human made art to still latch onto what little is left of its withered battered life and continue for at least to the next generation as a hobby in spite of Tiktok destroying Gen Alpha’s attention span and enforcing the desire for instant gratification that would discourage them. I still believe we will see the last human artist within the next century, their attitudes similar to the last Ninja; not taking students and letting the old ways and art history fade away from common knowledge and into the history books(without the glamorization the Ninja had in media).",""
"324","CMV: Pay discrimination within entertainment is not bad","I’ll preface this with saying discrimination based on race or characteristics of the person is unacceptable. The way I am using pay discrimination is based on how value an actor, athlete, musician, etc can create and not based on their “group” (women getting paid less than men for similar jobs).The main reason why I don’t see pay discrimination as bad in entertainment is because it’s hard for me to see any of these fields as being replaceable or identical. Take three actors; Tom Cruise, Scarlet Johannsen, Morgan Freeman, each commands a big paycheck whenever they step onto the screen. I don’t Imagine anyone would say they are not worth their value for their respective movies, but are their co-stars paid the same level? I can’t imagine they are even if they have the same screen time. Harrison Ford got paid much more than his costars in the Last Jedi despite having a fraction of the screen time. Reason being they are paying for what he done previously, and directly for what he is doing on the screen in that particular movie.For movies I see the value that a big name actor brings to the screen being a more guaranteed way for a movie/TV show to make money. People are more likely to see a show with an actor they already know than something with someone they don’t. This means the pay discrimination that people face in the movie/TV industry is more based on how well you are know and how much audience you can make to see a project.For the music industry I think it’s much more direct, you make money off of how many people listen to your work. I think it’s almost harder to find prevalent bias in the music landscape, apart from the bad deals artists sign as they are trying to blow up.To change my view I am looking for some kind of evidence that there is an underlying bias in some field of entertainment that cannot be chalked up to people trying to predict success/failure that results in a group of people being paid less.",""
"325","CMV: It's possible to pass a massive, progressive economic reform package that would appeal to the GOP","I have in mind something like the following, which would be all part of one package:1. No minimum wage2. Personal taxes are simply a set %-age of wages. No deductions3. Poverty rate calculations are done annually and regionally adjusted4. All adults receive a livable, regionally adjusted, non-taxable universal income at 2x the regional (not national) poverty rate. These dollars would not be attachable for any debts, fines, fees, or other purposes by any party.5. Everyone gets untaxed, universal health care with guaranteed full coverage6. Get rid of all other monetary welfare and food assistance programs, social security, and medicare/Medicaid7. Eliminate VA medical benefits and roll them into #5My thoughts are that some of the typical GOP complaints are valid. SSN benefits aren't keeping up with inflation and can't be made to based on the way it's structured, for example. And maintaining multiple insurance programs for veterans and the elderly is duplicative and wasteful.I also am on board with the idea that if a company wants to hire someone for $0.25 an hour, and they can find someone who wants to work for that much money, then that should be a transaction between those two parties. The reason we have a minimum wage is to prevent businesses from exploiting workers. But if workers don't have to work to survive, then it will be more of the case of businesses being allowed to price their labor based on the value it produces and what the labor market demands for that worker.We can get to an effectively flat tax structure for wages, eliminate a lot of complexity in tax structures, and thus reduce administrative costs at the IRS for taxes for average people, freeing them up to examine taxes related to businesses and business owners more closely.At the same time, we can ensure people have enough money to survive, making them not dependent upon their job to address their basic needs. They'd have medical coverage and care, eliminating medical-expense-induced bankruptcies and the need for so many people to work while sick or ill.While I don't think we'd ever see something like this brought forward since both parties would freak out at the idea of their shibboleths being touched, I think a package like this could pass should it be brought forward. Because it addresses needs across multiple demographic groups and interests.  The exact details are flexible (maybe it needs to be 2.5x the regional poverty rate for UBI for example) but the overall idea is that every gets something important to them, and overall costs (public and private combined) likely go down.

"326","CMV: Eminem peaked with The Eminem Show.","I started listening to Eminem in 2002; I listened to The Eminem Show and wanted more, so I purchased The MM LP and the SS LP at the same time, as well as Devil’s Night by D12.

After listening to all of it and the rest of Eminem’s discography, he peaked at the Eminem Show. His artistic progression from Slim to Marshall to Eminem can’t be topped in terms of his musical output. After that, his rapping is mostly insane drug talk, rehab bs, and nonsensical word gibberish that doesn’t make for good art. I get why people say he’s not that good he’s just good with words.

"327","CMV: It's totally okay to not vote in government elections, and sometimes is the best thing to do","Wasn't sure about posting this, as I know I'm probably going to make a few people who read this mad. I didn't vote in the past, and some of my friends who I told were, perhaps obviously, upset with me. I also have seen plenty of stuff on social media about how people who don't vote are in the wrong, however I don't think it's fair to judge or get mad at people for not voting. I believe there are plenty of valid reasons why someone might not vote and wanted to see if anyone here could CMV on those reasons.***Reasons to not vote:*****Morality:*** This is the main reason why I didn't vote before, ~~so I'll put it first and would like people looking to CMV to focus on this~~ (ETA: I CMV regarding this reasoning so actually might be better to focus on the other two below now), however, I think not voting is the only way for me to guarantee I am a morally good person. Morals are subjective, so just to preface my personal morals are built on direct action and impacting someone else's way of life. In other words, if **you** personally perform an action that infringes on the rights/livelihood of someone else, that action is immoral to me. That said, there are certain issues on both sides that make me too uncomfortable to vote. These are just some examples from each party:   * Democrats: Despite not voting I am actually pretty political and typically side with the left on most/all issues, however, the idea of gun control is really sketchy to me. I hate mass shootings, and personally am not a huge fan of guns, but I also know that there are a lot of well-intentioned, knowledgable, and responsible gun owners out there. Let's say I vote blue, and democrats gain enough power to restrict gun access or ban ""assault rifles"". These laws work for the most part, but someone gets unlucky, and because of tighter gun restrictions isn't able to get a gun. You might say only people who shouldn't own a gun won't be able to buy one, but this is a big country and somewhere there is going to be a weird stipulation that causes a responsible person from obtaining a gun. I just refuse to believe any law like gun control bills will work correctly 100% of the time. Okay so if someone isn't able to obtain a gun despite being responsible enough to own one, and then is later attacked/murdered when they couldn't defend themselves, I feel partly responsible for their death. Maybe a better example would be to just point to Obama. I love Obama, he is probably my favorite president of our lifetime, but to point to one of his negatives he did command a lot of missile strikes in the Middle East. Those deaths, including civilians, are a direct result of his election and a direct result of the votes he received. If I cast a vote for him, and I am the reason he is in power to command those strikes, then I have to feel in some way morally responsible for those civilian deaths.* Republican: This is a lot easier but trans-health care. Abortion rights. Etc.**Not informed enough:*** It definitely depends on the election and what office it is for, but a lot of the time people are just not informed enough to vote on certain issues. Honestly, this reason isn't even for me as much as others. I myself actually do keep up with politics and would consider myself above average in terms of understanding policies and current events. That said, I have seen way too many videos online of absolute morons who have the right to, and do, vote.  Why should people be entitled to make decisions for others if they can't even name who the current Vice president is, let alone understand basic economic principles or foreign affairs? I believe in giving everyone the right to vote on principle because without it government could easily become corrupt (or more than it already is), but don't believe that everyone should actually go out and vote. IMO if you aren't informed/knowledgeable about the topic then stay at home on election day.**Doesn't Matter**:* Finally, it doesn't matter. I get it, ""what if everyone thought like you? Would that not matter?"" This is a hypothetical ""what if"" scenario that doesn't happen. People who are obsessed with politics vote. Me voting/not voting isn't suddenly going to change the minds of everyone else. While I know there are others out there who think like me, at the end of the day what I ultimately decided to do won't impact their decision. Also, this depends on where you are from, but a lot of localities have blowout races. During a presidential election, if you are from California it doesn't matter which candidate you vote for. It will end up being a democrat who receives California's delegates in the end, whether you vote for them or not. And this goes back to my morality reasoning, if your vote DOES matter then it just reinforces my first point. You are even more directly responsible for any consequence electing that official may have. If their policies lead to the deaths of citizens, you are in some way responsible for their deaths.",""

No if, ands or bits - if you bought the game, you hate all members of the trans community. Worse if you just reviewed/streamed it, you're anti-trans - the controversy with Girlfriend reviews and the current state of the sub shows that they are not above using bullying tactics to make their point. To me, and their completely unapologetic nature about it, demonstrates this sub is a hate sub.My second point is that the sub is actually just moral grandstanding, meaning they are making their argument as a way to as easily as possible state their philosophical beliefs without having to do the work or actually supporting them.You know what I haven't seen at this sub, like at all, during this time of controversy? Links to LGBTQ or pro-trans issue charities or NPOs. Or links to how to volunteer and help the LGBTQ, or even just the trans, communities. Really, to my knowledge the sub has not supported or discussed any ways to actually benefit any members of the LGBTQ community other than ""post mean -spirited memes and yell at ppl who disagree with you online"". Plus, the sub is collectively incredibly morally absolute - who either hate everyone who buys, plays, or discusses the game in any even remotely positive light, or you're transphobic.For these reasons, I genuinely don't mind labels this sub as a hate group and that I should be banned.",""
"329","CMV: The meaning of ""no ethical consumption under capitalism"" is a criticism of the inherent exploitation of means of production, was never meant to be a reductive condemnation of consumers of art made by morally imperfect artists","There is no determinable source for the origin of ""no ethical consumption under capitalism"" verbatim. However, concepts like ethical consumperism and consumption activism have always been centered on boycotting environmental harm, animal rights, and exploitive labor. ""No ethical consumption under capitalism"" exists as a left-wing slogan solely because it is a core tenet of the left that all labor is exploitative under capitalism.  It was never intended to cast broad judgments on consuming ""problematic"" art or artistic products that have a very minuscule and limited capacity for material harm at best.  Edit 1: Yes, Hogwarts Legacy is a relevant example but not the only example I had in mind when I posted this. Here are other examples - cyberpunk 2077, consuming art from artists who were ""cancelled"" e.g. the band Brand New, Kanye West, and Sia.

I’m not suggesting the government should not have implemented pandemic measures like social distancing and masking but rather that Covid should have been a wake up call for all America to regain some semblance of health and fitness.

They literally treated patients like subhumans inside.

If you are a newcomer (first 7 days) you have to obtain permission even to go to the toilet. I feel that the environment in mental health psych wards was worsening, not improving my mental health. Also, all the Bipolar and Depression patients are lumped into the same ward so I as a mild case was thrown together with literal lunatics. I couldn't even fall asleep at night because some crazy guy would yell-read the Holy Bible all night. (Funny, I sang the Internationale in response lol) Also, many patients especially elderly ones are literally abandoned by their children and basically had to stay there forever, they're driven mad by all this condition. One patient never stepped out of the hospital for 34 years, another 31 years and they both seem good people who behave just a little weird. So patients who only pose a risk to themselves and not others should not be compulsorily hospitalised and should be able to get out if the hospital on their own (and their families) discretion. Even if they are hospitalised, they should be given more freedoms, instead of being forced to stay in a jail for months or even years.",""
"333","cmv: Some people and countries have less culture than others","The definition of cultured from cambridge dictionary: educated in and familiar with literature, art, music, etc.A person who just listens to the shark song all day has less culture than someone who listens to the shark song and a whole new world all day. It takes time and effort to read widely, watch lots of films from different genres, etc, etc.You can also argue that some countries have less culture, especially in countries where there is censorship which reduces the variety of art that can be found elsewhere (though propaganda machines can make sure there is the same quantity). There's a lot of other things involved and it varies over time but some countries produce more and better art than others at different times. My parents tell me that when they were young everybody could play an instrument and there were lots of local bands writing their own songs that would play most weekends. There are still some but it's not like that anymore (here). I would argue that means that we are less musically cultured now than in that time (comparing britain in the 70's to now).Objectively there's nothing wrong with having less culture, I just think that it makes life more interesting.I didn't think this was controversial but I got downvoted for it.&#x200B;Edit: View changed, I had having more culture being synonymous with being more cultured which apparently isn't how the english language works. I guess I need to try and reframe my thinking. When I go travelling I definitely have thought some places have more culture than others.

If such services are used on young children to give them skills suited for whatever their parent wants them to be (for example, a parent could improve the kid's intelligence if they want the kid to land in an Ivy League), it will be effectively set up the kid for a more competitive childhood instead of a more relaxed one (which can lead to burnout and mental health issues), plus, it sets more pressure on the child to follow what the parent wants them to become instead of what the child wants to become (mental health issues again)3.

"335","CMV: The United States is the most likely culprit to the Nord Stream pipeline sabotage","**Note:** My stance is *not* that there is evidence to show that the US is the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt, or even that it is more likely than not that the US caused the explosion. My position is that given all possible explanations, the US sabotaging Nord 1 and 2 is the most likely of all explanations for the explosions and Congress should demand a full investigation to uncover the facts.**Context:** [On September 26, 2022](https://www.vox.com/world/2022/9/28/23376356/nord-stream-pipeline-russia-explosions-sabotage) the natural gas pipelines Nord 1 and Nord 2 from Russia to Germany leaked as a result of explosives. Nord 1 was fully operational while Nord 2 construction was incomplete in part because of German actions in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. In the immediate aftermath, the United states heavily implied that Russia was the saboteur with Biden's press secretary saying the following (emphasis mine):>Q: Thanks, Jake.  In his speech this morning, the President called the Nord Stream pipeline attacks, quote, “a deliberate act of sabotage.”  And he said, “…now the Russians are pumping out \[mis\]information and lies” about it.  Should we take that to mean that the U.S. now believes that Russia was likely responsible for this act of sabotage?    >  >MR. SULLIVAN:  Well, first, **Russia has done what it frequently does when it is responsible for something, which is make accusations that it was really someone else who did it**.  We’ve seen this repeatedly over time.**Evidence and motivations:** The first thing to recognize is that, to my knowledge, there is little hard, substantive, evidence to indicate who is at fault for the attack. At least evidence that is known publicly. That being said, I believe that an understanding of motivations and circumstantial evidence points to the Unites States as the most likely perpetrator.\#1: Motivations of the United States - In my mind, the United States directly benefits from the pipeline explosions in a few ways. The first and most significant possible motivation is that it ensures that Germany won't back out of their embargo on Russian energy. At the time of the explosion, there was significant fear that with the coming of winter, morale for supporting Ukraine would decrease once energy prices in Europe would increase. Just last month, US Diplomat Victoria Nuland stated:>I am, and I think the Administration is, very gratified to know that Nord Stream 2 is now, as you like to say, a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea.”Secondly, the embargo on Russian energy has led to an [increase in imports from the United States and other allies](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-sour-crude-cargo-sails-germany-russia-sanctions-bite-2022-08-08/).\#2: Lack of motivations for Russia - The pipelines are jointly owned between Germany and Russia and are incredibly expensive. Many people have pointed to the possibility that Russia destroyed their own pipeline in order to raise the price of energy and profit as a result. This makes no sense in my mind. If Russia controlled the pipeline, they could just as easily cut off the supply to have the same effect without destroying billions of dollars in infrastructure.In addition, the [NYT has reported that Russia has begun the process of repairing the pipeline](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/26/world/europe/nordstream-pipeline-explosion-russia.html). It would certainly be odd to sabotage your own pipeline only to then begin costly repairs only 3 months later while in the middle of a costly war.\#3: The Seymour Hersh story - Last week, Hersh [posted this to his substack](https://seymourhersh.substack.com/p/how-america-took-out-the-nord-stream) detailing how the US blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. It is important to note that the details he provides about the US sabotaging the pipeline rests on a single unnamed source. That being said, Hersh is a respected journalist to many and [while he has gotten some stories wrong](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/11/8584473/seymour-hersh-osama-bin-laden), he has also done Pulitzer prize winning investigations like exposing the My Lai Massacre and the torture and abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. Given his significant past reporting, I believe that we should not dismiss his accusations out of hand and should be included when determining who most likely committed the attack.**Why it matters:** Many people may be asking ""If there isn't hard evidence either way, why should we bother to determine who is the most likely culprit?""It matters because I believe there is enough doubt that the US Congress needs to perform a thorough investigation to determine the United State's culpability in a manner similar to the Church Committee in the 70's. If the United States was behind the attack, it would not only be a terrorist attack on an enemy but a NATO ally as well. All without congressional oversight or approval. I am not naïve enough to think that if true, the US hasn't done this kind of thing before. That does not mean that we shouldn't respond as citizens by denouncing these terrorist acts as loudly as possible.",""
"336","CMV: ineffective science curricula in the US at the primary/secondary level contributes to science denialism/illiteracy","Up front:* I know there isn't a monolithic US education system as such; I am going off of my own experience and have no reason to believe it was atypical.* I am exempting cases where the most important thing is that students know certain facts or build other skills, since teaching the process of science is not necessarily conducive to teaching facts. (This is also why I exempt tertiary education, since the goal is often something like teaching the engineers to reason about reaction forces.)* Curricula, not teaching. This is critical of the overall structure of what is taught, not how individuals teach it.For context, I'm thinking of cases where somebody thinks the science is bad because it changes over time or asks for a single controlled experiment to prove anthropogenic global warming. These don't fit with how the science is actually done... but the asker **doesn't know that**, because what they learned of science in school was collections of fixed facts, often readily demonstrated by a single laboratory experiment.Therefore, it seems to me that the situation could be improved if people were taught (shown through practice, not just told in lecture) that:* Science is a process of seeking explanations/developing models, not an accumulated pile of facts. This is not shown at all in science education as I'm familiar with it; you run some simple experiments, but you know there's a fact that you're supposed to demonstrate.* Science does not have to mean laboratory science with precise, well-controlled experiments. These are often impossible or unfeasible and we can do good science without them. This is not shown in science education either, because people only do lab experiments, and if they learn about other fields at all it's only as a pile of facts. (Personally, I only had coursework in the usual physical sciences and some of the lab end of geology before college.)Coupled with this, I would argue that learning particular facts is generally not the most important goal. There are a few things where that's reasonably important, like knowing enough about chemistry to recognize that dihydrogen monoxide shouldn't be banned because inhaling it will kill you, but mostly the facts of the physical sciences are less important (barring career relevance) than being literate enough in the process to understand the (public-level) conversation, as a voter and so on.I think that's enough to illustrate the general problem. To briefly argue for a viable solution:* Some of the lab-based physical sciences should be kept, but labs should be about investigating things, not ""proving"" things [edit: proving things we already basically know], with an emphasis on gathering data, then creating and testing nontrivial hypotheses about the fundamental behavior of the system and in such a way that hypotheses may be supported by simple experiments and challenged by further work. (When I was in school we technically hypothesized, but mostly you knew what was going to happen and the hypothesis felt like a formality for the lab report.)* Some of the usual physical sciences coursework should be replaced by fields that are data-driven at the level a high schooler can understand, with an emphasis on analyzing data for labs and so on, again with the same hypothesizing and testing process. I think there's a lot in the earth sciences that you could do this way, and in any school with some grass outside they could even collect and analyze field data as a complimentary component. On the data end, vast amounts of data are now publicly available online.Edit: example of the first one, for clarity:* Current curriculum: ""Water flows through soil with a velocity proportional to the difference in potential energy.  Let's identify the specific proportionality for these soil samples.""* Proposed approach: ""We can reasonably assume that velocity is driven by potential difference, but how exactly?  Let's test some soil samples - and a pipe for good measure - and see if we can work out a relationship.""  A big part of the point of this is that the pipe will, with sufficient velocity, contradict their hypothesis about the soils.",""
"337","CMV: You shouldn't take out more than $20,000 in loans to get a car","Note: This is from the perspective of a middle-class American generally speaking about America.Basically, my view is: if you're so poor you need to take out that much in loans in order to afford your car, you should be getting a cheaper car. And if you're so rich you can afford a more expensive car, you shouldn't need to take out that much in a loan.I saw this statistic (source: [https://www.lendingtree.com/auto/debt-statistics/](https://www.lendingtree.com/auto/debt-statistics/)). It was pretty mind blowing.>Americans borrow an average of $41,665 for new vehicles and $28,506 for used vehicles, according to Experian.Cars are expensive, and people take out a lot of loans for them. I understand how a lot of people need cars for getting around commuting, groceries, etc. But you can get a car that does the job for significantly less than the amount people seem willing to pay. I know Dave Ramsey says to always save up cash for a car, which I think can be a nice idea, but not realistic/right for everyone (as with most of his ideas). I do think the idea of not going into too much debt over a car is a good idea, though, especially for a depreciating asset like a car.If you're trying to invest in a good car that will last you a while, I think that's a good thing, but I don't think that's worth that much debt. I think you can get a ""good enough"" car for less. You can get a brand new Toyota Corolla for only a bit over $21,000, and a new Chevy Malibu for a bit more than $25,000. Including a down payment, you should be able to get even a new car for less than $20,000 in debt, if you really need the top of the line in safety. It seems better to me, though, to be debt free with a car that may die a bit earlier. You can buy used cars for much cheaper on Facebook Marketplace or any used car place. $20,000 was just kind of pulled out of the air as a high end amount that you might need, if you needed a good enough car but didn't have a lot of cash to pay for it with. I personally think it should usually be lower than that.I also think that buying a nice car for prestige is stupid. If you have a nice job and budget for a very nice car, sure, go for it. But I don't think going into significant debt for the sake of a nice car is worth it, or a good financial or life decision.Exceptions. I suppose it's probably a bit more specific to say that I think \*most\* people shouldn't take out that much in a loan to get a vehicle. I do think there are a few exceptions to this. The exceptions that come to mind:\- If the vehicle is an investment or a part of your work, e.g. a truck you use for work, I think it's worth investing what you need into it.\- If you have someone who needs special vehicle accommodations, e.g. wheelchair access, I can see that as something worth paying more for if you really need it (because it doesn't exactly work as a vehicle if it can't work for you).\- If you are doing vanlife or something else where you will be living out of your car, it becomes something worth investing in more (especially if it will reliably replace rental/housing payments), though I still think you should avoid as much debt as possible.\- As I've been thinking about this I came across [one video that argued](https://youtu.be/LDRlc4EIB2o) that, for certain market conditions, if you have the money saved up for a car, it can be more economical to take out a loan to finance the car and invest the money you saved up for the car. I think this is more of an investing decision than a car purchase decision, so it's not really the same to me, but it does technically fall under this.Things I don't think are exceptions:\- Emergencies. If you crashed your car and need a new one ASAP, I think it's much better to get a used car, and/of something ""cheep"" that can get the job done until you can get a car that fits better to your needs.\- Prestige. Everyone else at your job having a BMW doesn't mean you should go into debt to get one.\- ""I want to buy quality"". Then save up so that you can get that quality without significant debt.Basically, I still think that for \~95+% of Americans looking to purchase a car, they shouldn't take on more than $20,000 in debt to do so. If someone is going to change my view, I imagine it would either be through convincing me that more people \*should\* be taking out large car loans, or by illuminating to me more exceptions than the ones I enumerated.**tl;dr**: With few exceptions, if you would need a $20,000 loan or more to purchase the car you're looking at, you should just get a cheaper car.Edit: I apparently didn't word it very clearly, but If you have the money saved up, and the choice is between spending it on other investments + taking out a car loan, or spending cash on the car, I can see how it is often a financially better choice to invest it.Edit: My view has been changed in how money can be used in better ways than being spent on cars when auto loans are cheep. I hadn't realized how widely this was financially true. I understand why it may be better to use loans to purchase a car, even if you have the money for buying the car in cash, and even if you don't it can often be a better financial choice. I still retain my personal opinion that spending a lot of money on a nice car is generally not particularly worth it, but as that isn't exactly what the CMV is about, I consider my views thoroughly changed.

"338","CMV: Police in USA should've better and different training to reduce a numbers of killed suspects","I was born in Russia and live in Russia and I always feel angry when I see how American cops straight-up shoot an unarmed suspect or immediately use their guns against someone who's armed with a baseball bat, crowbar, knife or screwdriver. For me, it's just a cowardice and showing of lack of proper training and complete lack of hand-to-hand combat skills of American cops.My points and arguments? I want to see American police more competent, having more guts and hand-to-hand combat skills to subdue unarmed or armed with a melee weapons suspects/perpetrators. It would reduce the numbers or using of excessive force or straight-up killings of suspects and perpetrators.1. US cops should have more advanced hand-to-hand combat techniques and disarming moves. Like, Krav-Maga has it, aikido has moves designed to handle against an armed opponent (especially it it's a knife), combat sambo (used by Russian police) has a disarming moves and moves used to fight against an armed opponent.2. De-escalation training. American cops is too rude and too loud with their orders to drop the weapon and surrender, which usually makes perpetrators more angry or provokes a mentally ill perpetrators to attack cops. British and Japanese (and most part of European) cops has way better track record with that, and even Russian police, with all of their issues, has way better de-escalation training than American cops.3. Shoot to incapacitate and minimize the damage which cops are inflicted to perpetrator. Yes, I mean ""shoot in the leg/arm"" if it's possible, because it reduces the chance of the death of a criminal. And before you would say ""cops are trained to shoot in center mass, and hitting the leg with a firearm is hard and it's not always incapacitates the perpetrators, and it cam damage a femoral artery and criminal would bleed to death"" - I would refute it. Because shooting the criminal in his/her leg is possible if perpetrator is standing still, but resists arrest or refuse to comply. And shooting in the arm is basically the same, especially in a hostage situation or when criminal uses a human shield. Shoot him in the arm, then bullrush into him using a sheer numbers advantage, take him down and beat the crap outta him until he's incapacitated. Artery? Cops won't left the perpetrator bleeding, because first aid (cops should've be trained in this too) plus ambulance. Russian police has a laws which implies thet they have a DUTY (yes, a duty) to minimize the damage inflicted by them to criminals, which means ""shoot the perpetrators in the limbs, but before - warn them a lot of times that you would shoot and you should make a warning shot, before eventually shooting into the suspect""). Why American cops has so much disregard to criminals' lives?! Yes, I mean, they are threats, but it doesn't mean cops always should kill them.4. More usage of non-letal stuff, such as pepper sprays, tazers or batons. And using guns in less lethal way, such as how it happens in Russia, because Russian cops doesn't have tazers and pepper sprays in their standard armament on consistent level (mostly only on paper, but not de-facto). So, they can only use batons, hand-to-hand combat skills or a gun, but because of the previously mentioned by me law, cops have a duty to minimize the damage inflicted by them to criminals, which means ""shoot the perpetrators in the limbs, but before - warn them a lot of times that you would shoot and you should make a warning shot, before eventually shooting into the suspect"". And surprise! It works! Russian cops rarely kills even armed suspects, because they know how to do that without guns!5. Police's whole goal is to ARREST criminals, not KILL them! And no, sorry, I don't buy the bullshit called ""But cops shoots in the center mass to stop the threat, not to kill!"". Yes, they are shooting to kill! Because if I would unload a whole pistol's magazine into a drunkard who refuses to drop the knife and comply - he DAMN would die!!! Instead, why don't use a baton, tazer, pepper spray or outnumber the perpetrator and beat him on the ground until he's incapacitated and doesn't pose a threat anymore? ""Officers are feeling threat for their lives?"". Then what they even do in police?! It's a risky job and you knew it, you cowardly moron! Sorry for my temper, but it really pisses me off... Cops fearing an unarmed teen or drunk guy with a knife or crowbar sounds so pathetic as an excuse to use guns against them... Where's your training in hand-to-hand, de-escalation or non-lethal weapon? In Russia, cops would likely blitz that drunkard with a sheer numbers and beat the crap outta him with their fists and batons, disarming him and handcuffing him after some ground grappling, but American cops would just draw their guns and shoot him dozens of times because SOMETIMES people can withstood a couple of gunshots even while sober (which is not an excuse to unloading a damn whole magazine into a not complying suspect!).6. Made the laws stricter because cops in USA has too much rights and can basically kill a suspect and get away with it. In Russia, every case of using a gun by cops is thoroughly prosecuted and if it wasn't justified - a police officer can receive a lot of troubles, including being fired, lowered in his/her rank or even convicted for using an excessive force and abusing the authority.Alright, I think I said everything, and now I am waiting for criticism and really GOOD arguments to change my mind.",""
"339","CMV: If communities were setup like ancient tribes, there would be no poverty. I can explain...","Modern society has been setup incorrectly.It's almost as if communities are setup like little businesses, entities where people travel from near or far to move into, and pay to rent/own properties that are managed by folks who most of time don't even live locally to the property. People travel miles into the city to get to work, or telecommunicate hundreds of miles for a paycheck. Some of us work for large corporations that employ thousands nationwide, that have boom and bust cycles of employment; dishelving thousands of families. We eat hormone-induced food grown hundred of miles away and sold in large conglomerate food institutions; farmed by almost enslaved culture groups on peanut-low wages for hard work.Everything about today is on a macro-level. We live in a society where everything is essentially outsourced; from food, work, entertainment, home/auto repairs, beauty/health, education, and so on.Specialization of work is ok, as it allows folks to focus on one thing and do it well.

In video games even more because there is usually a randomly-generated ""team"" that are poorly coordinated if at all. If it's all ""natural"" then camping would become the best strategy for any single player because if you decide to attack, your team mates are likely to sit back and watch and shoot at the targets you discovered from a safe distance, while you get farmed and die. It's kinda like a prisoner's dilemma in the game that I play, World of Tanks.If you camp and your teammate camp, both lose fun, and both have average stats.If you camp and your teammate rush, you get excellent stats and have a bit fun.If you rush and your teammate camp, you die quickly, no fun at all and no stats.If you rush and your teammate rush, you have fun and some good stats but usually not spectacular.For almost every situation, camping is the choice of  a well-informed, selfish individual playing normal types of tanks (not a light tank or arty). Thus 70% of the games reach stalemate where it's boring damage trading or even ""static"" where everyone is sitting still and NO ONE SHOOTS AT NO ONE. Before the balance is broken because a few guys grow impatient and decide to rush and die. Then the defending side, now superior in manpower, can defeat the originally attacking side. Sometimes the timer just expires and the battle ends up in a draw.In conclusion video games should combat camping by shrinking the battle zone, introducing new mechanisms like a special ammo to lit the battlefield up, respawn mechanism to decrease the penalty of dying, or higher rewards for aggressive gameplay that doesn't bring good stats but good win rate.",""

"342","CMV: public transport can’t compete with the convenience and reliability of cars","As someone who can’t drive due to a medical issue and who lives in a country that has very decent public transport, and who uses that very frequently to get around I  think that Cars are still the most convenient way for the majority of people to travel.They are just so much more flexible, oftentimes, people will talk about the speeds of various trains, but this is usually Station to Station and doesn’t take into account the time it takes to get to the station in the first place, and then the time it takes to get from the station to your final destination so using the train can take much longer., Plus, the spoke and hub design of most public transport systems, while efficient, means that it takes longer to get to towns and cities which are close by because you have to travel 1st to a central hub and then onto your final destination.Also, public transport has to follow certain designated routes, the train can’t follow a different path if there is an obstruction on the line but has to wait until it’s cleared and  any small delay can cascade in to much larger delays further on especially if multiple forms of public transport are involved.And finally, the average person doesn’t have a say on how many trains or buses serve a particular route, this is all at the discretion of the local council or government and services can be withdrawn or scaled back without any recourse.That being said, I think probably London Underground is comparable to a car but no other public transport systems in the UK can even come close.",""

Never-mind the economic implications for voice performers, or the various issues with image rights and copyright, being able to generate high fidelity impressions of any specific individual - not just celebrities - is **extremely dangerous**.

Safeguards in these AI systems are easily bypassed, and in any case such safeguarding should not be left to these companies alone to determine.In my view this needs to be regulated, and in the absence of regulation, banned. And since - at least in my country of the UK - many of our politicians and regulators are completely illiterate about these machine-generation models, banning it outright seems the safer option.I recognise though that this is a fairly reactionary view, so I'm interested in hearing from anyone who feels the risks *can* be managed and feels there are sufficiently interesting use cases which justify this technology.",""
"344","CMV: The death penalty/murder is never the answer.","I just saw the footage of that nineteen old being sentenced to life in prison because of that massacre in Buffalo where he murdered 17 innocent people in a predominantly African-American neighborhood supermarket. The people in the courtroom were noticeably upset because they believed he was lying about his remorse which I totally understand. Some guy actually rushed the bench and had to be restrained. I talked to my Mom about it, and she said he deserved to be executed. In today’s society, I do not think murder is ever the answer whether it’s a person or a government. I understand that at times throughout human history, a death sentence may have been the only solution because there just weren’t enough resources to properly incarcerate an individual, so we don’t have to go down the “What about Hitler, etc…” road.My definition of murder is a premeditated slaying of a non-consenting human. This eliminates things like self-defense, euthanasia, coercion, etc… I’ll try to reply as much as I can because I’d like to understand more about where my mom is coming from. She got weirdly defensive when I simply said, “I don’t think murder is ever the answer.”Edit: I’m loving the discussion so thank you for the replies! I’m going to sleep pretty soon, but I’ll try to get back to this as fast as I can.Edit2: Thanks again for all the replies. I guess where I'm at now is that the death penalty should be allowed for people who without any doubt committed truly heinous acts deliberately and repeatedly. The process in which the death penalty is enforced should be much more rigorous than it currently is because too large of a percentage of people are sentenced to death due to either a)their crimes not warranting such a harsh punishment or b)their discovered innocence.",""

"346","CMV: Public Schools Should Have A Mandatory Prayer Session Before School Starts (USA)","I want to make the case for school prayer. K-12 grade in the USA public schools.Disclaimer: I am not from the US and wasn't educated there.The reason that I advocate school prayer is that1. Students of the same faith, and even of different faiths, can band together in unity. Prayer brings people together, to share in worship.2. Prayer, just like speech or song, is a form of expression. This gives students the opportunity to openly, or privately, pray, which conveys the love of their God.3. Prayer can help guide students to make the right decisions, and better choices throughout the school year. It is nice to start the day with prayers. This way, the students can take comfort in knowing that their day will be blessed.4. Through school prayer time, students can be exposed to different religions. If you have a diverse student body, consisting of many different faiths, students will be able to see that people pray in different ways. Being exposed to other religions can promote tolerance and kindness.5. Some religions require prayer time at certain times. In Islam for example, the Duhur prayer (midday) may fall in the lunch break of a student. Allowing the student time to pray in a quiet place would be respectful, even if the teacher doesn't believe.6. Prayer can calm the mind, making students feel happier and less stressed.The prayer should be at the start of the day (unless a student feels they should pray at a different time, like midday, even then extra prayers are good) It might be maximum 5-10 minutes, and non sectarian, so everyone can join in.Debate me because according to my friends I'm starting to sound right wing and conservative and a bit too pious.

"347","CMV: Source Material does not Matter","  Whenever someone brings up that ""adaptation"" is the essential quality of any work I want to roll my eyes and have a seizure. Never in the history of humankind has anyone really cared that much about the originators of a story or a source, and if they say they do ask them if they like Stanley Kubrick.The most important aspect of any work is to convey an experience to the audience. If someone wants to base their work off of something else, or use a previously existing work as a basis for their own story then more power to them. Playing off the source material's preconceptions or just mooching a few cool ideas does not oblige someone to slavishly make something in the spitting image of some other work. People have been stealing from, retelling and rebooting stories since people have told stories. Dracula has so many different interpretations and retellings that he's barely even related to his source material anymore. Or even the actual person, Vlad Tepes. Movies, anime, games, and more books than I can count have used Dracula more as an archetype or name itself than a character. At one moment he's a straight up agent of the Devil, a monster, and the other moment he's a tormented soul trying to cope with his immortality and lack of love. Godzilla as well, went from being a large giant sign screaming ""NUCLEAR WAR IS BAD"", to a generic action hero (Who's also a single father, struggling to provide for his son). And yet, the 1990s reboot of the Godzilla character is condemned as the worst in the series. Even though the movie has more thematically in common with the source material than something like Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla. Because Godzilla looks different, and the movie isn't about the giant monsters fighting, the movie is a failure. Which one is better? None of them, they're all too different to judge on the merits of being adaptations of Dracula/Godzilla or using them as a tagline. What matters, first and only, is what they convey and how they convey it. In recent times, people have become almost infatuated with accurately portraying characters on the big screen. Even as far back as the original X-Men films, people have been raging about how X is terrible because its portrayal of a character does not match their preference of what they should be. Oftentimes, just brazenly ignoring the actual text of the originals. Because in the end, they don't really care about the text of the work or the truthfulness to the source material. In my experience, they care more for the emotional gut of the work, and recreating the feeling the original did. If they saw the movie as a child and care more for the spectacle (Rambo), then movies that home in more on that aspect are “truer” to the original. Even if they ignore the themes and character arcs of the original work. If they saw the movies as adults, then they will probably clap at something doing away with the more juvenile aspects of a work to hammer home a thematic core. Even if the juvenility of the original was the fun of it.Coming from a house of X-Men virgins, I can tell you that anything you can imagine pissing off the nerd sphere today has been published over a decade ago. Batman killed people up until the 70s, Spiderman beat Mary Jane, etc. And these are in the original works. But people tend to ignore those aspects of them because they don't fit their emotional reaction. There is no intellectualizing “adaptations”, because the person has already forfeited engaging with the work by only looking at the work from this emotional lens. TL; DRPeople are mad that X movie remake is not like the book because they were kids when they read it.",""

The UN defines sub-replacement fertility as any rate below approximately 2.1 children born per woman of childbearing age, but the threshold can be as high as 3.4 in some developing countries because of higher mortality rates.As of 2010, about 48% (3.3 billion people) of the world population lives in nations with sub-replacement fertility.In 2016, all European Union countries had a sub-replacement fertility rate, ranging from a low of 1.3 in Portugal, Poland, Greece, Spain, and Cyprus to a high of 2.0 in France.If the populous drops too low, infrastructure can't be maintained.

"349","CMV: School shooting drills create a culture of fear. The chances of dying in one are exceedingly low. As low as plane crashes. As a society we are not afraid of plane crashes","I hear references to ""run hide fight"" on school IDs and of these drills and they seem so unnecessary. Good advice for kids though. We had very minor drills when we went to high school 15yrs ago.On a plane there's an entire show and dance about a one in several millionth chance. The same chance as school shootings. Put your earphones in like you do when they give the safety precautions on a flight.When I went to school we as many bomb threats as formal code red drills. Bomb being a code yellow was like a schoolwide firedrill which allowed kids to just leave for the rest of the day.  We knew some asshole just gave us a free day.This is only a statement about school shootings, not gun violence in general.Edit:According to research compiled by the independent K-12 School Shooting Database research group, there have been 189 shootings at schools around the US since Sandy Hook that have resulted in at least one fatality.The shootings counted include everything from suicides and domestic violence.Seventeen were ""active shooter situations"" - defined as ""when the shooter killed and/or wounded victims, either targeted or random, within the school campus during a continuous episode of violence"".While those events count for a small portion of total shooting incidents, they account for more than a third of all casualties. In total, 279 have died from being shot on a school property during, before or after school hours, including weekendshttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63911172(as of 2022)Still school seems like the safer environment than the walk or ride home. Strictly speaking of safety. Besides the IDs the drills themselves can be dramatic. That could shock a generation of kids. Teach em run hide fight at gym and recess and leave the rest alone.Edit: I'm not sure about the psychology of the wave of school shootings and the politicization as well as polarization in the gun debate. On the issue I go more libertarian than on economic issues, and other social issues. ----------------I think I msy be universalizing my perspective as better but my school was in a tougher neighborhood than the majority of kids who attended it lived so it was known that the inside of the school was safer but also not completely safe. The narrative that school shootings are common occurrances is false. It's a statistical lie and promoted by an ambulance chasing newsvan. They are more common but they are not common. Still rare. We have more extreme weather events but people don't go wild fighting over the weather (except hurricane resoonse). --------------So here goes a central point. Senseless violence shocks people in a particular way that is natural. I kinda like both the FDR quote about fear and W saying ""if you change your lifestyle the terrorists win."" Probably the smartest thing he ever said. Senseless violence will shock kids worse. They have to be taught the scope of the problem.--------Also the reason it can't be stopped is because of the rarity it's impossible to pinpoint genuine threats from cries for help or know what's going on in someones head.

"350","CMV: gun owners who do not anticipate killing someone else are bad gun owners.","E: Anticipate might be a strong word to use. What if we use ""willing to""? Thanks to aulock1 for pointing out the bad vocabulary. E2: It seems many are having a hard time arguing this successfully with me. Here's some hints: the easiest ways to cmv is to convince me that the rules I've built my argument on are faulty or false, and/or argue that the claims I've made that do not logically derive from these ground rules. E3: Well fellows, it's been fun but it's time for me to get back to my homework. First, let's get some basic rules down that we should all agree on. First is one of the gun rules: don't point it at things you aren't willing to destroy. Easy enough. Secondly, guns are not to be brandished. While it is apparently a person's right to openly bear arms, it is to remain inconspicuous and undrawn until it is needed. Let us assume some arbitrary situation where one may or may not draw their gun. If killing someone is not required, the gun should remain undrawn. Easy enough. If lethal force is believed necessary, the gun is drawn. This fulfills the second rule, where the gun is not freely wandering about and only drawn when (believed to be) needed. However, the gun cannot just be drawn (otherwise it's simple brandishing), it must be pointed at this assailant or dangerous entity. Using the first rule, we hereby label this target as ""something to be destroyed"". This target must therefore be shot and killed, otherwise the gunner has demonstrated that lethal force is not required and/or they are unwilling to destroy their target. As a corollary to this, it must therefore be true that an individual who willingly obtains a firearm (or any weapon frankly speaking) for self defense is willing to kill, otherwise they are simply a person on a power trip whether or not they realize it. Therefore, a person unwilling to kill should not own a self defense weapon. Furthermore, if a dangerous person is not killed by our protagonist gun-wielding fellow because the ""sanctity of life"" is paramount, they should also not be a gun owner due to their unwillingness to kill. Using two very simple rules that are widely (dare I say universally) agreed upon, I believe I have made a strong argument that gun owners who do not anticipate killing should not be gun owners. Of course, this is all within a self-defense context.",""
"351","CMV: We should stop calling it the 'justice' system.","From what I understand the data indicates that capital punishment and harsh punishments don't do much to reduce recidivism and preventing crime (I mean, death obviously prevents recidivism but you get my meaning). So as loathe as I am to admit it we are better off adopting a more ReStOrAtIvE approach to justice because that results in less crime overall. But we should stop calling it the justice system then because turning rapists and killers into respectable members of society doesn't do dick for the victims, specifically *their* victim.Say you take a robber who shoots a store clerk in the face when he robs the place. You send him to whatever restorative program deals with guys like him and you convince him that actually killing is a very not nice thing to do, how he should ask for help when he's in financial trouble rather than rob a corner store, and it's a success. He's not going to hurt anyone again and he can deal with is emotions in a healthy way, etc.That does not do any justice for the store clerk. Or the family who's lives have been shattered by this robber's actions. All you've really done (in the long term) is  reward the robber. You've taken him in, payed for his life on the state's dime, treated him very gently(because restorative justice proponents are also in favor of humane prison conditions). Maybe his life in jail is even better than whatever shit neighborhood he came from. Maybe he even gets an education in jail so when he leaves he can have a better chance to find work, meaning he's in a better position in life than he was before he shot the clerk in the face.Fine, good thing that he's less likely to rob another store. But you've basically in the long term rewarded the guy. Justice, at its heart, is based on fairness. On people getting what they *deserve*. And it is 'fair' if you are hurt in the same way you inflict harm on another. If you shoot someone, you *deserve* to be shot. If you crush someone in a drunk hit and run, you deserve to have your own bones shattered, if you rape someone you deserve to be violated yourself.It's not a matter of 'justice' whether the criminal goes on to do it again. Justice means ensuring that the people involved are treated fairly, that they got what they deserved.  And if our robber friend murders a minimum wage store clerk, giving our robber the path to a brighter future is completely unfair to our store clerk and his family.Yes, 'restorative justice' does result in less harm overall, and we should adopt it. But we should stop calling it justice and instead call it something like 'the good public policy system.'And I think it's obvious how this doesn't do dick for the victims of truly heinous individuals, like Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy.",""
"352","CMV: All public high schools should be mandated to have at least one sex-ed class where porn is boldly presented and discussed.","My high school was farily progressive and had a comprehensive sex-ed class, but my teachers never discussed nor showed porn. I feel like that's irresponsible for a modern institution. They cannot really protect people from the negatives of the medium unless they actually display it.I've consoled many people on Reddit before about penis sizes. Many young men develop a belief through porn that the average penis length is around 6 inches. In reality, the average penis length is about ~5.1 inches. 6 inches would be in the top 10th percentile. Unfortunately, pornography has a tendency to use angles and even prosthetics to enlarge or reshape the genitalia of its participants that distort its viewers' perception of the world.This concerns me because the people who've vented to me had developed a sense of shame around their bodies that lead them to engage in self-isolation. There are men out there who have a micro-penis (<3.7in), a legitimate medical condition, but that affects roughly 1 in 200 men. Most men, however, do not have this condition, nor would they even know how to properly measure to actually find out. I've become frustrated with the amount of misconceptions out there that has lead to needless shame, doubt, and self-loathing.I know that some women also develop a sense of shame around their vaginas because they do not match the imagery in porn. It's problematic that young people have access to a distorted view of their bodies without any perspective to evaluate and challenge the information they are presented with.Yet, the issues above are really only about body dysmorphia. I have not even discussed the potential for young students to develop disruptive masturbation habits as a result of the medium that can lead to erectile dysfunction and other disorders. For instance, some people have developed habits where they masturbate 21+ times a month, or in the top 90th percentile of ejaculators. I do not want to fully disparage pornography. Everyone is different and people can engage with the medium in ways that are healthy. Frankly, they could masturbate to it 1000+ times month and still live normal, undisrupted lifestyles. However, for America's student population, I doubt that there isn't at least a notable portion that have developed negative feelings about themselves, disruptive habits, or unrealistic expectations around sex as a result of pornography. Their should be teachers out there who can navigate the awkwardness and challenge the narratives presented in the medium.Porn is too accessible and integrated into modern society for it not to play a role within sex-education. However, I recognize that it would be perceived as scandalous to bring it into the classroom. I would like to know your perspective. Perhaps there is a good reason to keep it out sex-ed classes.",""

They formulate opinions based on insufficient information and project them to whoever they are discussing this topic with.As someone who has seen countless uncensored videos (especially after the Russia-Ukraine war), I have been finding it more and more absurd how people discuss it. My entire opinion on wars has dramatically changed ever since I got more exposed to what *really* happens on a battlefield. Reading or hearing about it is *nothing* like seeing it.

In a way, we invaded Canada.**Trump:** He not only pulled us out of the Paris Climate Accords, but he invited Putin to invade Ukraine by threatening to withhold military aid. But unlike Putin and Russia, we \*elected\* Trump. Sure, I voted for Biden in 2020 (I wasn't old enough to vote in 2016), but it looks likely that Trump will win, or at least come close, in 2024.

"359","CMV: Saying Christ or Jesus as an expletive is the least grave or meaningful interpretation of taking the Lord's name in vain.","This is one I've circled back to a few times, but tl;dr there's a goodly chunk of Christians that believe saying Jesus, God or Christ as an expletive constitutes taking the Lord's name in vain, and a smaller(but still sizable) portion of Christians that are gravely offended by it. From the literal interpretation I've always taken that to mean as ""you shall not speak the Lord's proper name unless circumstances specifically demand it"" as in the name the Lord gave and usually isn't spoken at all. &#x200B;On the other hand I've also heard the moral interpretation that taking the Lord's name ties in with bearing false witness, on the one hand depending on the size of your Bible the ban on false witness is on the same page as using the Lord's name, and more broadly in the context of Matthew 5:37, you really ought not to be making any oaths before God for anything because you shouldn't be lying at all, let alone enough to merit such an oath. &#x200B;With those two understandings I've always struggled with where ""don't say Jesus when you stub your toe"" fits in. Sure it seems a bit profane and thoughtless, but it's not directed at anyone in particular in such circumstances any more than saying ""Christ"" if your engine catches fire. I understand the Bible generally describes thoughtlessness as problematic, but most passages regarding speaking ill/profanity/etc. usually describe the context as carrying a degree of malice or speaking in a manner damaging to another person. &#x200B;All this to say, I have trouble really being on the same page with those who treat using one of the above terms as an unintentional expletive as a serious or grave sin.

"360","CMV: “Transwomen are women” is confusing and unproductive shorthand.","**UPDATE BELOW***NB:* I am addressing only the phrase “transwomen are women” because this topic involves clarifying contested language. Limiting my focus to three words seems most tenable. I chose “transwomen are women” because I am a woman and I hear this iteration  more frequently in women’s spaces than “transmen are men.” The same arguments apply.I am here because I am a compassionate and curious person who values everyone’s right to be accepted on their own terms. I am also a thoughtful person who believes that language and rhetoric matter very much. I don’t know whether my view will be changed because I have put a lot of care into understanding my own thoughts on this topic, but I know my view *can* be changed because I would much rather be correct than confused on the issue and I am fully open to considering new explanations. I believe this conversation is important, and I am here for arguments I might have overlooked.One last thing. I recognize that people will assume the worst of my personal motivations. I accept that. I value, welcome, and respect trans people and I know whether bigotry or good-faith uncertainty is the motivating factor in my heart. I do want to say, however…I will be completely unimpressed with any attempts to deploy “ewww, mentioning physical human bodies and their differences is an inappropriate genital fixation!” This is a serious conversation. I am a lifelong liberal deeply embarrassed to see the rising appeal of this ridiculous shut-down in left-leaning spaces. There is absolutely nothing sordid or dirty or salacious about acknowledging that human beings have bodies with parts. We don’t consider everyone’s genital arrangements in daily life, but there are obviously contexts where commenting on the existence and form of human bodies \*is\* fully appropriate. One appropriate context is when we are discussing sex-specific issues or considering the meaning, effects, and impact of gender- and sex-change interventions in society. As long as we are respectful, mature, and kind, it is both necessary and absolutely normal to acknowledge sex organs when talking about sex or gender.**CMV: “Transwomen are women” is confusing and unproductive shorthand.**I believe “transwomen are women” is a confusing shibboleth that would be better replaced by specific expressions of support, especially in discussion contexts where shared language is critical. I think this phrase remains unhelpful even when no single, tidy definition of woman is easily agreed upon. The phrase makes use of a breakdown in language where speakers operate under subtly different definitions of the word “woman”: a social definition limited to how people are perceived by society, and a more traditional definition that acknowledges biological sex as relevant to the concept of womanhood. We don’t need to agree on which definition is more important to agree that distinguishing between senses of the word is valid, necessary, and unoffensive. “Transwomen are women” makes it difficult to clarify which sense of the word is being used without appearing to invalidate transwomen themselves and so undermines the usefulness of conversations.My view is NOT that it is never appropriate to refer to transwomen as women in casual speech. It is frequently appropriate. My view is that the phrase, as it is used in advocacy and debate, should not imply intolerance on the part of those who use the word “woman” to describe people born with vulvas or other female sex-associated traits. “Transwomen are welcome,” “transwomen have a right to be heard,” or “Oh, Barb! I’m so glad you’re here!” would be less fraught expressions of support in my mind.Let’s assume you have a worldview that says, “I believe the idea of womanhood has no relationship to biological sex. There is no significant conceptual aspect of womanhood that relates to female bodies, female development, female reproduction, or female anything, and when people center the female sex in conversations about womanhood they are either transphobic or confused.” In that case it seems perfectly reasonable to say “transwomen are women, no further discussion necessary.” Of course hormones, breasts, and surgeries will also be unnecessary for transwomen if you are assuming a definition of womanhood that discounts female-sexed bodies as relevant to womanhood.If female-sexed bodies are relevant to womanhood in *absolutely any sense*, however, it becomes not only understandable but necessary to distinguish that transwomen and natal women are in fact quite distinct forms of womanhood and that differentiating between them will sometimes be appropriate.In practice, I believe “trans women are women” is most often used to say “I accept your gender-identity at face value and stand in solidarity with you.” This is a decent and well-intended message. However, the phrase is also used to mean, “if I truly embrace your stated gender at face-value, then there should never be a need to acknowledge that transwomen are different than natal women in any context.” This attitude promotes the avoidance of challenging conversations, not the practice of social tolerance grounded in a complex understanding our differences.So why not just say ‘women’ when referring to the social performance of feminine roles and some form of ‘people born with vulvas’ when referring to biological females? Well, anyone is welcome to do that. But - language changes by consensus, not decree. My concern is with positioning rhetorical compliance with non-standard terminology as an entry-level requirement for respectful conversation, not with choosing to use the word to describe transwomen yourself.Right now it is common to problematize the notion of binary sex altogether as a way to assert the permeability and instability “woman” as a concept. The logic goes like this. We know biological sex is a complex cloud of interrelated physical factors and body states, and the vast majority of people are born somewhere in one cloud or the other even if they don’t exhibit every sexed trait in every instance. If there are some cases of rare chromosomal abnormalities, say, or intersex conditions that make it challenging to identify which cluster of related physical traits will be dominant in a child’s development, that implies that the categories of male and female can be thrown out the window or declared functionally irrelevant or completely arbitrary. In other words, if we ever accept that a child with subtly ambiguous intersex traits may sometimes grow up to be considered a woman, then we \*also\* ought to conclude that an adult male with a fully developed penis and testicles can be classified as a woman just as neatly. That’s silly. I think of this as the “ambiguity anywhere demands ambiguity everywhere” fallacy: if it is challenging to talk about certain sexed bodies with precision, then we must insist that all sexed bodies are unknowable outside the highest levels of scientific scrutiny. That’s obviously not the case. Most people are born with bodies that are recognizably male or female, and we can acknowledge those broad categories and leave the medical exceptions to doctors. It is an appropriate use of language to generalize that nearly all female people will be born with vulvas, and that an “adult female person” is someone born with a vulva who has grown up. That a few rare girls display ambiguous genitalia does not change that.Sometimes people acknowledge biological sex but argue that the idea of womanhood is completely distinct from a female-sexed body. That’s probably true in some senses, but it is not true for the standard meaning of the word “woman” we use in English. The Oxford English Dictionary is the academic reference-tome famous for documenting the evolution of English-language words based on actual usage. The earliest documented appearance of “woman” in English occurs under the definition “adult human female” and appears around 800AD in the barely-parseable beginnings of Modern English. The word’s history extends back into Middle and Old English before that. No abstracted sociological sense of “woman” invoking characteristics such as “womanly traits” appears in print for another four hundred years. “Adult human female” remains the dominant definition today, making “woman” one of the most enduring and consistent common nouns in the English language. In fact, the primary definition of woman in the OED includes a note that reads “man (or and woman) used appositionally = male (or and) female.” In other words, according to the definitive source on word-usage and etymology in English, the phrase “men and/or women” is most often a direct equivalent for “male and/or female.” The second-most-common definition of woman, after “adult human female,” is “the female human being; the female part of the human race, the female sex.” “Transwomen are women” ties our ability to express solidarity and moral support for trans people to rejecting the meaning of a word with an especially old and common connotation. For this reason I do not believe the phrase promotes clear, specific understanding around sex or gender.My point here is not that language should never change. My point is that definitions of “woman” understood to exempt male-sexed people and assume female-sexed people is both the oldest and most commonly-used meaning of the word in English.My last concern, since this is so long, is that “transwomen are women” is not only a problem because it creates confusion. It is also a problem because controlling language in that way makes it difficult to describe or discuss certain real-life situations. Let’s say you are a member of a woman’s group, however you define that. You are happy for the transwoman next door to join you. Eventually, you notice that the ten-person leadership committee that has been exclusively female-bodied people for the forty years since your mother sat on the Board has four male-bodied people on it for the first time. You think this is great! You are truly thrilled! However, you can’t really conduct a conversation about this remarkable, directly relevant, publicly-visible social change with truly historic implications as it plays out in your personal life because any attempt to engage the topic would require acknowledging that transwomen are different in certain ways than the natal women. To be a kind ally on “transwomen are women” terms you must pretend that no change of any kind has taken place at all. Sometimes, to speak accurately about what is going on in our lived reality and our gendered spaces, we might need to acknowledge that in some senses, transwomen represent a different kind of womanhood than natal women. That shouldn’t be unsayable.Insomuch as “transwomen are women” is a welcoming way to say “I think transwomen should be treated in the way that makes them feel comfortable and respected on their own terms” almost anyone would agree. But when “transwomen are women” is used to mean “acknowledging that differences exist between transwomen and natal women is transphobic and good people will pretend no differences exist regardless of context” it is a much less useful position. I agree that transwomen are “women” in the social sense that implies they should be embraced for the gender expression that best satisfies their personal needs in the vast majority of day-to-day interactions. I disagree that transwomen are women insomuch as that phrase is sometimes used to mean that acknowledging differences in biology, experience, or treatment between trans and natal women should be framed as offensive or verboten or personally delegitimizing.“Transwomen are women” insists on verbal compliance with one notion of identity-oriented sex-assignment, but it doesn’t actually help clarify any of the sticky, nuanced, subtle uncertainties that exist when we talk about sex and gender. I think it would be better to replace this phrase with direct expressions of acceptance, warmth, and support that minimize the risk of talking past each other.UPDATEHere are some common arguments I hear and want to acknowledge. The first goes like this: 1. Transwomen are women in the social sense. No one anywhere is saying otherwise.2. These definitions are not confusing.I have tried to address the misconception that if a conversation is not about genitalia, then a purely social definition of woman is understood. But if someone says “that woman stole my chicken!” and the speaker would be surprised to find a penis under that woman’s skirt, then a definition of woman that assumes female sex is at play. It’s the wrong definition to assume in retrospect, but this is still the *consensus usage of the word.* Language changes all the time, yes, but there is an effort here to insist that the change has already taken place - entirely. It hasn’t. I am  unpersuaded by arguments that when the OED provides “adult human female” as the primary definition of woman in English for over a thousand years, it means something else. Attempts to divorce the word “female” from biological sex seem especially confused, and I think there is also confusion distinguishing what the word typically *does* mean from what we believe it morally *ought* to mean. **I have never argued that only a biological definition of woman should be used. I have argued that since both definition ARE used and both definitions ARE sometimes appropriate, enforcing preference for one over the other is a poor way to demonstrate personal tolerance.**The point is NOT that a shift towards a more social definition is wrong or shouldn’t be used . The point is that if we must already accept the redefinition of “woman” at face value in order to have a place in the conversation, that cuts out a majority of people and assumes that any reason to refer to the primary definition of womanhood is likely hateful. **My view is that this is explicitly why “transwomen are women” is unproductive: it insists that accepting the change in language and all its implications should be a requirement for *discussing* the change in language and all its implications.**The other popular argument, of course, is seeing personal wickedness in the need to distinguish transwomen from natal women in any actual context where the groups are beginning to merge. This seems to be the argument:1. This phrase is not used to shut down conversations unless the conversation is trans-exclusionary, but2. Virtually any conversation where you might need to distinguish between transwomen and women is trans-exclusionary, so3. What exactly is the hateful thing you need so badly to be allowed to say? Many people have implied that if I believe we need to be able to talk more openly about the entrance of transwomen into women’s spaces or the switch from sex to gender categories, then I must intended to drive transwomen out. **No.** If everyone already agrees transwomen are different than natal women and sometimes have different experiences of womanhood, then it is critical for understanding the experience of *transwomen*, just as much as natal women, that we remain able to engage these shifts with candor and kindness. Some commenters have passionately argued that *excluding dissent is the point.* That is my fear. The world is not divided into bad people who want to expel ordinary transwomen from their own social lives vs. people who think “transwomen are women” is a self-evident, uninteresting, and uncomplicated idea. That is unfair and untrue. It is a textbook example of the “everyone outside the dogma of my predefined ideological in-group is a dangerous existential threat to my predefined ideological in-group” thinking that is so reliably flawed and offensive when it emerges in any other religious or cultural context. This position is rarely necessary when arguments stand up to scrutiny on their own, which is why patience, civility, and kindness even towards open racists was such a historically-effective cornerstone tactic during the Civil Rights Movement.“Transwomen need protection from hateful bigots” =/= “Transwomen need protection from anyone who acknowledges the millennia-long association between womanhood and female bodies.”  There are also many comments implying that I sound like an old-school racist. Anti-racism argues that it is wrong to impose a social category where no biological category exists. The new genderism argues that it is wrong to acknowledge a biological category when it conflicts with a social category, or else that if a biological category is sufficiently complex and multivalent, we may as well scrap it and replace it with a purely social category instead, same difference. The arguments look parallel but the premises are not.Yes, there are social changes like race where we have thoroughly settled the question. Even though gender-non-confirming people have always been around, the rates and forms of gender-transition today are novel and significant, and the decision to replace default-sexed categories with default-gender categories has not yet played out at scale. Arguing that this social shift is still playing out is not the same as arguing that it is wrong - only that sex and gender are an appropriate topic for kind, respectful conversations.I have enjoyed this conversation and regret that there are so many great comments I have not been able to answer I may post a new CMV in a few weeks to see if I can refine my position to one with more general consensus based on feedback here. I will be going back in comment form to explain my delta, still. Be well, friends.",""

Furthermore, I've been mentally gatekeeping the Anthem to only government entities. That's wrong. The Anthem belongs to all Americans, and we should be free to use it however we want, and the more people use it, the less it's tied to specific political movements.It's still propaganda, but in the big scheme of things, not a huge deal.Go sports ball!\------------------The way the US national anthem is used at sporting events is wrong. It's crass advertising at best, or manipulative propaganda at worst.At least at the Olympics, or FIFA, I understand it's intended to be a friendly national rivalry.But at events like college sports, NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, these are fundamentally entertainment venues. They have absolutely nothing to do with national patriotism. There's no civic duty involved. There's no sacrifice for country involved. This is not the funeral for our servicemen or front line first responders who gave their lives for country. This is not a political rally, or townhall. We are paying money to be entertained.If we stood for the national anthem to before watching Captain America punch Thanos in the face we would recognize there's some dystopian shenanigans going on.I understand WHY these organizations do it. Every advertising agency wants to link their product to national pride. It sells tickets. But for other products we understand it to be crass and not to be overdone. If you slap flags and eagles with striped hats shooting M16's onto breakfast cereal, we recognize it to be naked opportunism, not a genuine love of country.Furthermore, the WAY it's done is pure propaganda. Everything stops. Everyone stands up. Everyone puts their hand on their heart, and everyone stops to stare at a flag and sing along. If I flipped the flag and song and changed the location to a foreign country, we would recognize this to be cult of personality brain washing.I understand WHY the government is ok with this. People like their sports ball. Associate the government with love of sports ball means the populus has good brain juices towards Uncle Sam.I also understand that most people just go along with it without thinking too hard. It's a small gesture and a ""cultural"" thing.But that makes it worse for me. This is a systematized ritual where corporate greed and mindless nationalism are used to sell entertainment, while pushing large groups of people for mindless love of country. There is no critical thought to the actual process of government, attempts to improve or country, or truly appreciate both the good and bad of our country.

"363","CMV: I don't see much of a difference between MAGA and ""principled conservatism""; they all seem the same to me. Trump and the Populist Right don't seem very different from the mainstream conservative movements in US history."," From my perspective as a (non-Marxist) social democrat/modern liberal/secular humanist; I don't see many differences between Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan. The policy of being soft on Russia was actually started by George W. Bush, not Obama, when Putin invaded Georgia and George W Bush did literally nothing. Obama merely continued most of Bush's foreign policy idiocy (I don't approve of him being soft on Russia when they invaded Crimea). Likewise, Trump shows overt favoritism to Israel (a bipartisan American policy since the 1970's) and Saudi Arabia (a VERY GOP policy since the end of WW2). Trump's weird isolationism is more akin to standard GOP policy prior to Eisenhower's presidency (remember that tarriffs and protectionism were a Republican policy from the late 19th century until the post-WW2 era; indeed the robber barons of the Gilded Age usually favored protectionist policies in the US; and we all know how the Smoot-Hawley Tarriff made the Great Depression worse)Domestically, I am not the first to point out that Trump's response to COVID-19 is following Reagan's precedent of AIDS denialism. His major policy achievements are tax cuts on upper class earners (THE animating philosophy of modern conservatism), excessive swelling of the national debt in peacetime (a bipartisan issue that Reagan essentially started when he surpassed Carter and Nixon-Ford's debt spending combined) and relentless focus on unsustainable stock market gains combined with a very irresponsible FED policy (Remember it was Carter who appointed Paul Volcker, and we all know how Alan Greenspan's tenure ended). Trump's relentless antagonism of Latin American migrants is standard GOP ideology (support the War on Drugs and blame Mexico and Central America when American demand for addictive substances creates drug cartels); indeed the perception that the Democrats support illegal immigrants is really idiotic when Barack Obama deported more people than George W Bush and Joe Biden is continuing Trump's policies on the Mexican-American border. Likewise, Trump has basically animated the right-wing people of every religion not just Protestant Christianity, but also right-wing Catholics, Hindutva, actual Islamists, Orthodox Jews, etc. One can even argue that every major religion is being split along left-right divides these days thanks to Globalization, but I digress. Not even getting into the overt racism and general hatred of activist culture whether it be #MeToo or BLM (again, this very much started because of Barry Goldwater opposing the Civil Rights Act and courting formerly Democrat-leaning racists). People who antagonizing countries like Honduras and Nigeria by calling them ""shitholes"" in public don't seem like people who support legal immigration (I'm going through the process myself; it is NOT easy); and indeed Trump has done a lot to cut legal immigration (hatred of nonwhite people because Latin Americans are ""brown"" or Muslims ""hate Western civilization"" or ""The Christian European character of the US should not be changed"" is nothing new and indeed, hatred of immigrants both legal and illegal is as old as the hills - the GOP of the 19th century certainly hated non-Anglo Saxon people to an astounding degree)Really, the major thing that I see Trump being different from other Republicans is his hatred of democracy; but honestly I think the Libertarian movement has been inculcating this ideology for a while. ""We're a Republic, not a Democracy"" is also a sentiment that the Founding Fathers (the famous ones anyway - people like Thomas Paine were a minority) approved of.\*No personal attacks please; I just want to know for you ""Never Trump"" people, what makes you guys different from MAGA?

It would re-establish some of the excitement about the halftime show that seems to have dwindled. 3. I think the performances would be better / more creative / more exciting / more dramatic... ultimately, more entertaining. Arguments that might move me away from this position might include: 1. this would add some sort of negative influence on college bands, and they're better left alone. 2. a compelling argument that the NFL would somehow lose out on revenue. by compelling, it can't simply be stating ""that they would"". i am dubious that they would, since i think more people would be interested in a band champ's performance than a professional entertainer. and if so, the NFL would sell more add revenue, not less. so convince me they'd sell less ads. 3. that college bands wouldn't be able to put together a better product. i'm dubious here, but again, this sits in the, ""i might change my mind about this"" space. Arguments that would not move me away from this position: 1. personal preference arguments:    1. It wouldn't be fun. --> this is a a personal preference. i'm not saying you have to like it, but this argument doesn't address the unique benefits of allowing this be an award given to the best college band.    2. the performers are better --> again, a personal preference argument. 2. its not realistic / practical / feasible --> perhaps, but not what im talking about",""
"370","CMV: To sufficiently reduce the impact of climate change, the median American will have to undergo lifestyle changes. Most Americans are unwilling to do what is necessary, in part because of the relentless focus on the 1%.","**My Claim:** The *median* American uses far more than their fair share of greenhouse gasses when looking at a global perspective. Most people in developed countries (in my case the USA) unrealistically expect solutions to climate change that will affect only those who are richer than them. This expectation will lead to woefully inadequate results and is unfair to the poorest 50% of the global population who should be increasing their consumption to improve their quality of life.**Evidence:** People within the top 10% globally consume [10 times more than they are allocated in order to achieve the goal of  less than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. In fact, the richest 10% emits as much as the bottom 90%.](https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621305/bn-carbon-inequality-2030-051121-en.pdf;jsessionid=9C993232BE644C3840513C4916367380?sequence=1)  To be in the top 10% of wealth globally, you need only a [net worth](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/07/how-much-money-you-need-to-be-in-the-richest-10-percent-worldwide.html) of $93,170. The median net worth in the US [is $121k](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/average-net-worth-by-age) meaning that over 50% of the American population falls within the global top 10% that is living ""beyond their means"" in terms of greenhouse gasses.**Example #1 - Meat and Animal Products:** Americans consume [151kg of meat per capita every year. More than double the world average.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-type?country=CHN~USA~IND~ARG~PRT~ETH~JPN~BRA~OWID_WRL~ESP~DEU) They consume more than four times the world average of beef which is extra resource intensive. This is an area where the vast majority of Americans have the ability to make a simple, relatively unobtrusive change to their lifestyle to reduce their CO2 emissions by incorporating more plant-based foods but they still refuse.Most people agree that factory farms are terrible for the environment, animals, and the humans that work in them. At the same time, factory farms are the only way to efficiently produce the amount of meat Americans demand. You cannot have the same amount of meat consumption without keeping these ethically terrible and environmentally disastrous factory farms. Even with the advent of meat substitutes making the transition from meat even easier, many people seem to have the attitude that they will only make the switch when meat substitutes taste *absolutely identical* to animal flesh and costs *the exact same if not cheaper*.**Example #2 - Flight and automobile travel:** In 2015, [10% of Americans took 5+ trips with 45% of people taking at least one flight](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388484/air-travel-remains-down-employed-adults-fly-less.aspx). To put this in a global context, a single flight from London to New York and back generates about 986kg of CO2 per passenger. [There are 56 countries where the average person emits less carbon dioxide than that flight in a whole year.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/19/carbon-calculator-how-taking-one-flight-emits-as-much-as-many-people-do-in-a-year)Meanwhile, in online discussions and activist movements, almost all the focus is on limiting use of private jets even though [they emit only 2% of overall aviation emissions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/private-jet-emissions-found-to-rise-more-than-commercial-planes#:~:text=While%20private%20jets%20account%20for%20about%202%25%20of,sector%20had%20fully%20recovered%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%E2%80%99s%20authors%20wrote). Don’t get me wrong, I would support any effort to limit the use of private jets but it is clearly not enough. I’m guessing that the idea of disincentivizing 3+ airline trips a year would cause an uproar from most Americans who say that flight prices are already too high.**Bonus Anecdotal Example –** [This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1129ljp/house_democrats_introduce_ban_on_new_gas_lawn/) is the straw that broke the camel’s back for me and prompted my CMV. These responses to the idea that selling gas lawn mowers should be banned starting in 2025 make me lose faith that developed countries will do their fair share to avoid climate disaster. There was a huge backlash to this proposed legislation even though:\- It would not take effect for two more years\- You could still purchase used gas mowers\- They emit an insane amount of greenhouse gasses. A consumer-grade leaf blower emits more pollutants than a 6,200-pound 2011 Ford F-150 SVT Raptor, [according to tests conducted by Edmunds' InsideLine.com.](https://www.edmunds.com/about/press/leaf-blowers-emissions-dirtier-than-high-performance-pick-up-trucks-says-edmunds-insidelinecom.html)To me, legislation like this is the bare minimum and should be considered an “easy win” when trying to reduce our per capita greenhouse emissions but is still met with a large pushback and whatabout-isms about the 1%.**Conclusion/TLDR:** Avoiding the worst effects from climate change will require systemic changes that will impact the vast majority of people in developed countries. Even if it is theoretically possible to overcome, we are making the climate crisis much more difficult than it needs to be by refusing to make sacrifices on the cost, convenience, taste, quality, or quantity of what we consume. Relying on concessions from only the top 1% of people in developed countries will not be enough.**UPDATE EDIT:** I'm going to take a break from responding and I'll award a few deltas. A few thoughts:1. I understand that for people to make these environmentally friendly decisions like reducing air travel or meat consumption, we need systemic changes in order to prevent the poor from  disproportionately paying the cost of those changes. My issue is that I don't see the average person advocating to increase the price of meat while decreasing the cost of produce. I don't see the passion that people have going after private jets in a movement to make clothing more durable and sustainable. All the passion and activity I see is only directed at limited action that only affects a small # of people.2. The arguments most compelling to me were those that attributed people's actions r lack thereof to things other than a focus on the 1%.3. I regret including the anecdotal example. It detracted from the main point I was trying to make.4. I still believe that the average American lifestyle results in more than their fair share of carbon emissions. Even if I can't blame individuals for making certain consumer choices due to factors outside their control, I still object to the idea that I see frequently that people want to maintain the existing system for themselves and not advocate for a more environmentally friendly one, whether it's trying to get rid of gas stoves, beef, ICE cars, or cheap fashion.5. I promise I'm not a simp for 1%. Fuck over the 1% to your heart's content. I don't care. I just don't think that is enough.",""

"375","CMV: Local representation should be abolished","Most countries like the United States, Great Britain, Canada, India use local representation for their national legislative bodies. I think this system should be abolished and we should adopt the Dutch or Israeli model of legislation, proportional representation. The percentage of votes a party gets is the percentage of seats it gets in the National Parliament. Local representation should be ended. Think about it, when was the last time you genuinely and truly cared about your local representative, almost never. Now Reddit is chronically online and thus, knows and cares a lot more about politics than your average person. But even in this chronically online case, do you really care about who your local representative is? Not really. There are only two real circumstances where you might care: (1) You live in a place with a weirdly strong local identity. (2) Your representative is really amazing or really horrible. And these circumstances are not present in the vast majority of cases. If you live in a place with a strong regional identity, perhaps local representation is worth preserving but even in this case, a political party to represent their interests could be formed.Most politicians, owing to the law of averages are just average, not someone you really have strong opinions on, either way. Local representation also means systems like FPTP, which is horrible or RCV, which is less horrible. But both systems are highly prone to gerrymandering and wasted votes. In both cases, the power of your representative is unaffected whether they won by 50+1% or by a massive margin like 75%. I will admit that the Single Transferable Vote deals with these problems quite well but I still don't see the value of local representation.Most people will vote for any person with a D or R next to their name. If you broadly identify as Democrat, you are just gonna vote for the guy with a D next to his name, same for Republicans. If this is norm, then why bother pretending that it's really just local elections for a national legislature? We might as well make our voting system actually reflect how people think about voting. People vote based on parties, not individual people. Let's just make that official.",""
"376","CMV: Drinking as a social activity seems overrated, and is also confusing.","For context, I am a 20 year old university student in the U.S turning 21 next month. I’ve known about drinking as a social activity since elementary school, and I’ve never taken a sip of alcohol yet.I have friends that are going crazy at the fact that I’m turning 21 soon, and CANNOT WAIT until I have my first drink. I understand why, as it’s a social sign of adulthood. But at the same time I don’t understand all of the extra hype, and why it is so popular as a social activity. I have pretty much learned all the numerous problems associated with drinking. Addiction, getting drunk, throwing up, hangovers, saying things you shouldn’t be saying, making stupid decisions and loosing control of your actions, etc. Idk how all of that sounds appealing to so many (not all) people. The only positive I really understand with drinking is that it can be a stress reliever and/or make you “feel good”. But I see that as a future negative because it can become an unhealthy coping mechanism for external problems. When I weigh that with all of the other negatives, it doesn’t seem worth it. My parents drink, and they can control themselves fine. I’m worried about myself getting addicted and making dumb decisions; all so that I can be in an environment where the other activity is just talking. It doesn’t make sense to me. Why is it frowned upon to just drink juice or a soda at a social gathering where drinking is involved? Is there something else that I am missing?It doesn’t help that lask week I had a non-alcoholic beer for the first time. It tasted awful, like liquid carbonated bread crust. I know there are various drinks to try, but I’ve never even had a soda taste that bad😅.For deltas, I’m looking for positive reasons as to why I should consider consuming alcohol socially, even with knowing all the negatives listed. Or a complete change of view. Thank you!Edit 1: I’m reading all responses, and if I don’t respond it is likely because the idea was already said, or it’s something I gave a delta for already. Key takeaways that I have learned:1. A drink or two is good enough to be “socially lubricated”, without going overboard.2. Addiction occurs with more extreme habits of drinking.3. Hangovers can be avoided with drinking water in between alcoholic beverages.4. Being “socially lubricated” can bring out truthful aspects of personality, and other people are aware of that. As a result, people have deeper connections.5. The out of control behavior is more of a choice as opposed to a direct effect from drinking. Because of the more carefree environment, people knowingly will do things they normally wouldn’t do, sometimes going overboard. I should be able to still have myself mostly under control. 6. I’m still valid for choosing not to drinkEdit 2: I am not autistic. I believe it would be crude to try to explain why.",""
"377","CMV: The Phrase ""All Cops Are Bad"" is and ignorant phrase which suggests no or a ludicrous solution","my current view is that this phrase seems:1 - completely reductive of the good and valuable work many Cops do. more focus is given when Cops fail to do their job or commit awful crimes themselves but on the daily many crimes are solved including the most heinous crimes such as murder, sexual assault and the abuse of children. dealing with these crimes is objectively a difficult and harrowing task and the people that deal with them correctly should be commended2 - the phrase ACAB implies no solution. it suggests that any ""good"" person should immediately quit the police force, thus we are left with either no police force or even worse still, one made up entirely of ""bad"" people. so what is a ""good"" person that is currently a cop supposed to do?3 - I believe that although systemic racism is evident in the US, a large proportion of the issues involving Cops and civilians is due to americas gun laws. in my country neither the police nor the public are armed so the vast majority of interactions with police is typically very calm and tensions are low. in the US both parties fear for their lives due to the potential presence of deadly weapons - this point is a slight tangent to the main issue however",""

"380","CMV: Punching up/down as a concept is fine but enforcing it as a rule for comedy in part defeats the point of comedy","Hey guys, so I'm looking to have my view changed on the concept of punching up and punching down when it comes to humor. I've talked to a few people comedians and non-alike who say that it's wrong to punch down and as a rule people and comedians never should. I generally agree with them, but I do not feel it's right to enforce it as a rule to what makes good comedy and it's possible to enjoy comedy that is arguably punching down. Good comedy is whatever makes you laugh. It's a reactionary and some of us react to things differently and can find humor in things depending on our upbringing, personal taste, etc. Typically leading to what others would call a darker sense of humor. Not everyone finds 9/11 jokes to be funny. Some would say they're punching down on their victims and their families but as someone who was alive when it happened, humor can help process such an event. Jokes about mental health, race, rape, all kinds of awful things can be avenues for coping for people that have suffered for whatever reason due to uncontrollable circumstances like these. That might not be everyone's cup of tea and not everyone should be expected to like it, but they can be cathartic to those that do. I think the difference between a good joke about these things and a bad joke should be in the writing. Is it well constructed? Is there something to say other than being an edgelord? If they are being an edgelord is there still something of reactionary comedic value in there (an audible ""oooo,"" the jump-scare of comedy)? Those are my personal standards and I understand everyone will have their own, but I feel like that's why using punching up and down does more harm than good. It writes off the personal reaction to the jokes and categorizes them into something similar to a genre with negative and positive connotations on what you ""should"" enjoy. It always irks me a bit to hear someone write off a comedian entirely for a joke that punches down. I don't think that jokes need to have a lean or a moral code. It's either funny or it's not. For example, a joke that is racist with no substance would be considered ""punching down,"" and generally I'd probably be with you that it's a bad joke. Also though, with a poorly written joke it's likely that it's just not funny and it can end at that. Many argue that Dave Chappelle punches down on trans people. I don't want to turn this into a Dave debate, but he's an easy example. He's arguably funny, undoubtedly intelligent, and his jokes would have no value if they were just jokes at the sole expense of trans people and many of his jokes end with some kind of moral that points out why things are not great in this world for marginalized people. And it's okay for people to not find the humor in that, but it isn't necessarily punching down on trans people. In terms of the art form, I find using the phrase punching down to be lazy and writes off any other nuanced point the comedian may be making. Essentially, missing the forest for the trees. On the same token, enforcing a constant punching up waters down the comedy into always fighting for something or for someone. Which is fine but sets up this expectation to be paragon of virtue, when some just want to tell dick jokes. To always have jokes that are expected to make us think and could never hurt anyone or make anyone uncomfortable ever. Which is fine if that's what they're going for, but first and foremost a joke should be to make us laugh.  It's like when they traded out the big rubber balls in dodge ball for the foam ones that won't ever hurt anyone. Sure, it's the same basic game and can be fun, but it's not the same as getting whopped on the face and dealing with a welt the rest of the school day and sometimes that's what a good joke can do.In my opinion, a good joke is a good joke. I don't have much tolerance for edgelordy jokes, but if it's well written it can work for me and if it doesn't for you, that's not necessarily an attack on anybody. In an art from that is by nature meant to push boundaries. I understand why the categories of punching up and down exist but going so far as to enforce a punching up/down mentality on jokes wrings out some of the grittiness that actually exists and puts a pressure on comedians to conform to current societal norms and will stagnate it as art form. People are smart enough to know a bad joke when they hear it, anybody who's ever told a bad joke to a room full of people will learn real quick if they crossed a line. I don't believe jokes that aren't blatantly malicious are written with malice so it shouldn't matter if it's punching up or down if it's well-constructed. &#x200B;tl;drpoint 1: jokes can be cathartic even if they seem crass.point 2: categorizing punching up and down undermines comedy as an art form and will stagnate it.point 3: the pressure to always be punching up is too much to expect from comedians who don't want to lean in a political or moral direction.point 4: in the end it should come down to appreciation for the writing rather than glorifying punching up or demonizing punching down.",""

"385","CMV: The obvious answer to the Sleeping Beauty coin flip probability conundrum is 50%","A popular YouTuber came out with a video a couple days ago that laid out this basic scenario:The subject's name is Sleeping Beauty.  On Sunday she will go to sleep and she will sleep until awoken by someone in this experiment.  Once she is asleep, a fair coin will be flipped.  By fair it means that there is a 50/50 chance of landing heads or tails.If the coin lands heads, she will be woken up on Monday and then go back to sleep.If the coin lands tails, she will be woken up on both Monday AND Tuesday.Each time she is put back to sleep she will forget that she was ever awakened.For the brief period of time she is awake the experiment will be explained to her and then she'll be asked the question, ""What do you believe is the probability that the coin came up heads?""\----------------So that's the scenario.  Sleeping Beauty will always wake up with no memory as to whether she was woken up before so there is no cheating here, no trick.  It is a simple question that she has to reason out when she wakes up.The two arguments for it either being 50/50 or 33/33/33 I'll summarize as follows, but I'm told that entire thesis's have been written on both of these answers so I'm certainly not going to totally cover them.50/50: It is a fair coin and therefore there is a 50/50 chance the coin came up heads.33/33/33: There are three possibilities.  Either she was woken up on Monday and it was heads, Monday and it was tails, or Tuesday and it was tails, therefore each possibility has a 33.33% chance of being correct.\----------------With all that laid out, here is my view I'm asking people to attempt to challenge me on.The answer is so painfully obviously 50/50 because of how the question is worded.  ""What do you believe is the probability that the coin came up heads?""  If you answer anything other than 50/50 then you have to believe that somehow your actions or the actions of someone else are capable of changing the probability of the coin coming up heads.  If somehow you were able to reduce the odds of it coming up heads to only 33.33% then that means it coming up heads was linked to whether you did or didn't get woken up on Tuesday which makes NO SENSE!I don't even get how this question is contentions as having it be anything other than 50/50 fails so hard.  Like say  you only woke up on Monday if it came up heads but if it came up tails you would be woken up 1 million times.  So now the odds of it being heads is 1 in 1 million?!?!I believe that anyone who thinks that 33/33/33 is the answer is confused about the question because I can't think of a single instance where the answer could ever be 33.33%.  If the question was, ""What do you believe is the probability that the coin came up tails AND that it is Monday?"" then the answer would be 25% because there is a 50% chance the coin came up tails and then reduce that down another 50% since it might be Monday or Tuesday.  If the question was, ""What do you believe is the probability that the coin came up heads AND that it is Monday?"" now the answer is 50% because you get the totality of the 50% since that is the only day you'd get woken up if it were heads.Anyways, if anyone thinks the answer is somehow 33.33% I'd love to hear the logic alongside how you are interpreting the question so that you can have that be the answer.",""

"387","CMV: Adoption can be a good thing.","Recently I've come across a movement on social media that is passionately anti adoption, equating it with slavery and chastising adoptive parents for daring to ""want"" a child.The people weighing in on this seem to be sincere, and their position doesn't seem to stem from any political, religious or other common social movement that would push that kind of narrative for duplicitous reasons. it appears to be it's own thing. And I 100% don't get it.I DO understand that there exists a world of for-profit adoption agencies with sketchy practices, I'm happy to denounce those. And I'm happy to acknowledge that adoption, even at a very young age can be a source of trauma. But I don't really see the good alternative for actual cases where someone's birth parents or close family can't or won't raise the kid.I would even be willing to concede that some large numbers of adoptions might fail somewhere in the process when there were better options possible to keep the kids with their birth parents or extended family. But that's not really the position I'm countering, these people never give facts or figures about prevalence of these issues or the reality of their alternatives, it seems like just ""Adoption is bad"".When people in this movement are asked what should happen to kids, they default to either they should go to some extended family or they should go into permanent guardianship.The first option I can see would be preferable to going with strangers. But as I understand it, when parents die or lose custody, any state agencies involved DO give strong preference to placing with extended family whenever possible. And if there are gaps or problems with that process, then the problem is with the process, not with adoption itself, and the call should be to fix that process, not to shame adoptive parents.And as for ""permanent guardianship"" I have a hard time seeing how raising someone but not calling them your child is a better alternative, it seems to other them even more than the trauma of adoption.""Oh hi this is Billy my son and Tommy, a kid I'm taking care of who is not my son."" I don't see what's gained there or how it lessens any trauma of adoption.I'm open to changing my view because it seems like I must be missing something in their position. I've seen so many people sounding very sincere and passionate about this.",""
"388","CMV: Men are judged for their clothes about the same as women, it's just ignored","I've seen when restriction are placed on women's clothing in a public environment, people always say ""men are never judged for their clothing""! They are, probably as much as women but the difference is men generally don't fuss about it and people don't make as much noise.My school banned strapless shirts and people got in an uproar about it saying rules are only ever made for girls, completely ignoring that boys actually had much stricter clothing such as not being allowed to sag pant, wear hats or even sweatpants. I worked at a gym where the rule was no midriff and told a girl she had to wear something over her sports bra. She complained about it being sexist despite me telling a fat man who tied his shirt above his belly the same thing not 10 minutes earlier (It's actually what prompted me to tell her)[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1129n55/people_that_wear_their_pants_like_this/) is the post that prompted this.I left a comment saying>I think it's funny how people always say ""Men are never shamed for their clothes"" yet post like this aren't even rare.  >  >What is mildly infuriating about this?

"390","CMV:the art and the artist are separate","I believe this as an artist for many different reasons. Not the least of which is that I don't believe that art is necessarily a reflection of who the artist is. Art can be created with the intention of doing many different things. To shock, to inspire to draw interest, and sometimes, though it does sound awfully superficial, to just be beautiful. Art is not always, dare I say, not usually transparent as people would like it to be. I myself am really into Metal. My two favorites are power metal and black metal. Both of these genres, like all musically genres, have some instances of songs that are based on the artists political view. However the majority are about fantasy concepts. I find it hard to believe that the song ""chasing the dragon"" by dream evil was about the personal experience of any of the band members involved. Simply put art is beautiful for many different reasons. I can't fault a person for not liking some art. But to say that the art and the artist are the same entity is an outrageous claim.

""A did this therfore we should do X to A"" It's an word used by people that want to criticize something while being biased. Usually they refer to the moralic aspect but that is just hiding behind emotions when you can't have a valid argument. Usually what they do is suggest some action against one side and just say whataboutism when someone suggest that the same action should apply to their side as well then.This leads to echo chambers as others gets irritated arguing with those people and just ignore them. Which leads to that a community where only people with the same bias stays and reinforce each other. It's probably also related to the trend of emotional arguments instead of logical ones.Edit: I'm calling the person saying whataboutism for hypocrite not the one bringing up another scenario.Edit: Lots of arguments about the current problem should be addressed.

He would've sent letters out the same day that the loans are forgiven, which would've allowed borrowers to countersue even if the courts struck it down, because borrowers would've already received notices the balance was forgiven. Even if not, Biden could just set REPAYE payments to 0% of disposable income, and the amount of payments needed for forgiveness to 5 payments or something. Overall Biden seems to once again be paying lip service, while doing the absolute least he possibly can. Frankly, even $20K is very little when my grandparents could get a better job with a HS diploma than I can get with a CS degree.Even beyond that, his changes to the ""hardship"" factor in Student loan bankruptcy cases is rather lackluster. If he was actually serious he could just direct the DOE to automatically assume that all applications qualify under ""hardship"".

"394","CMV: The legal term “mass shooting” should be broken into two categories: ‘mass shooting’ and ‘mass shooting spree’. This will allow there to be much more context in regards to such instances of extreme gun violence.","Note: ALL GUN VIOLENCE IS BAD AND JUST BECAUSE A MASS SHOOTING TOOK PLACE AMONGST GANG MEMBERS DOES NOT MAKE IT ACCEPTABLE TO ANY DEGREE. MURDER IS MURDER, AND VIOLENCE IS VIOLENCE - ITS ALL WRONG. That said, I do believe that there is a lot of context missing when these news stories break out, and the people deserve to be in a position where they are not misled - intentionally or unintentionally. In the US, the legal definition of “mass shooting” refers to any instance in which three or more people are shot in a short amount of time. On a surface this may make sense to a lot of people. However, I believe that this terminology is too much of a blanket statement. I say this because due to the media perception and the more extreme cases, many people see this term synonymously with a white, teenage male running into a mall or shopping center and letting loose on random people. In reality, the majority of mass shootings (in the US, at last) are often gang related or due personal disagreements that escalate. For example, let’s say there was a gang related drive-by shooting in St. Louis, and for people got shot. That will automatically be considered a mass shooting. Although this would technically the correct terminology, when new outlets post the headlines “mass shooting in St. Louis leaves 4 people wounded”, many viewers would likely imagine another hate crime, terroristic attack, shooting spree, etc. Although 4 people getting shot is HORRIBLE IN ANY CONTEXT excluding self defense, there is a clear difference between a shooting like this and a “Uvalde” type situation.  This is why I believe there needs to be a new legal term (which would be “mass shooting spree”) in place to differentiate the two. This way, the public - along with legal authority - would be able to avoid any possible confusion on such occurrences. I believe it would also help pinpoint the root causes of these instances of gun violence. “Mass shooting spree”, of course, would refer to situations where multiple random and/or unsuspecting people were shot. When you hear “America had x amounts of mass shootings last year”, it’s hard to tell the amount of these that were personal or gang related (in which the victim(s) and perpetrator(s) knew each other) or occurrences which actually involved random, innocent bystanders dying en mass (usually due to hateful or political motivations). By adding the word “spree” at the end when necessary, we would then be able to easily differentiate such cases, and possibly even help ease the public’s hysteria - since it would become clear that it’s not always just random people becoming some lunatic’s target practice.  Meanwhile the term “mass shooting” could continue to be in place for non-shooting spree incidents.",""

"397","CMV: Being fat is no longer a sign of privilege","In the days of old, being overweight was usually a sign of wealth, and being skinny was usually a sign of poverty. This was due to the fact that food was much more scarce in the past and was treated more like a luxury. However, I think that these roles have essentially been reversed in modern society. Nowadays, food is much more abundant. What makes a difference in modern society is the quality of the food. Poorer people work more on average, leading to less time to cook and shop for groceries. Because of this, they tend to eat more fast food and be more overweight in general. This idea is further emphasized by food deserts in poor neighborhoods that don't even give people a chance to buy any healthy foods. Overall, this dynamic suggests that people with less money will tend to eat more unhealthy foods compared to people with more money, and thus, the dynamic of fat-wealthy skinny-poor actually reversed in modern society. Edit: Here's a list of things that changed my view:- I should've specified in title that this sentiment applies to developed countries in which food is not a luxury anymore- Millions of people are starving each day, first world problems are nothing compared to third world problems and frankly it's a sign of privilege to claim that being fat isn't a privilege- Poor people having less free time than wealthy people might be false (source needed)- Food deserts are a myth (source needed)",""

"399","CMV: Like in other nations, the US President should have the power to dissolve congress.","The last decade has shown that the US Congress, whether the House, Senate or a combination of both, sometimes stops functioning completely for days, if not week.I believe the main reason is that politicians have no accountability after they are elected. They even continue to receive their salaries, even while the rest of the government is paralyzed. Just the number of shutdowns we've experienced in just the last few years is ridiculous and shows how dysfunctional the situation has become.If the president had the power to dissolve the legislature under certain conditions and call new elections, I believe that would encourage much more to be done. Furthermore, this new power would not be abused, as a president may well lose members of his party in the Snap Election, diminishing his influence in congress. That means it would only be used if needed.EDIT: Folks, of course there would be rules for this power. Do you think in other countries they can just dissolve the parliment whenever they want? Can't do it to escape investigation, or to prevent a veto override, or do it multiple times... It would only be in times when congress is stuck, not working. And if you prevent the people you removed from running in the snap election, i.e. stop reelections, you refresh the whole congress and it would be more likely to work.EDIT 2: Yes, Presidential systems can also dissolve congress, not just parliamentary ones. One example is the Czech Republic. Even then, we can use the imagination to see this scenario as possible.  *But I do not agree that this would make the President dangerously powerful as this has not been the case with our allies.*EDIT 3: Leaders have been punished by voters by calling snap elections for opportunistic reasons.

"400","CMV: it makes sense for people in the aisle seats to stand up as soon as possible after a plane lands","I saw a post on Instagram today that was targeting people who stand up as soon as possible after a flight as impatient, selfish people, and apparently loads of people agree.It may be true that many of those who do this are indeed selfish and impatient, but that doesn't mean the act itself doesn't make sense. Before I go into why I want to clarify some context.1. I am only talking about those in the aisle seats here. If you are in a middle seat or window seat, I'm not gonna argue as strongly because there is simply not enough room in the aisle for EVERYONE to stand up. 2. I am talking about AFTER the seatbelt sign is turned off3. Extenuating circumstances are excluded. For example, I've been on flights where the flight attendants ask everyone to stay seated so people on the back of the plane can make a connection. Anyway, here is why people in aisle seats should stand up as soon as allowed:1. It saves EVERYONE time. When I am on a flight, I typically have my tablet, a charger, headphones, a water bottle, and some snacks, all in the seat with me. I always book aisle seats (mostly for other reasons, but this is an added benefit) and so I stand up immediately to get my bag from overhead and to pack up my stuff. This takes about 30 seconds. If I were to wait until it's my turn to stand up, this would add 30 seconds of wait time for everyone behind me. And while 30 seconds is not that much, if every aisle person had the same routine, on a 30 row plane, standing up early would save the people in the back row 30 minutes. 2.  It's normal to want to stretch as soon as possible when you've been in the same position for hours. It's healthy and a natural thing to do. I understand you can move around on the plane, but most flights, the last 30 minutes or so, the seatbelt sign is on. This especially applies to tall people, but short people like to stretch too. 3. It doesn't harm anyone. This point doesn't really stand on its own as to why it makes sense, but if it did harm someone, then the above two reasons probably wouldn't justify the harm done. Now obviously there are likely some special circumstances where it does harm someone slightly. The one example I can think of is where claustrophobic people are additionally triggered by people standing around them while they are seated, but those people should be booking aisle seats then. And this case is so few and far between that it's not worth making such an inconvenient rule out of it.I think the main thing that could get me to change my mind is if someone comes up with a common case where it causes others harm, or to negate my first argument, to the point where it actually costs people more time. Final note: I am writing this as I have some downtime, but I likely won't be able to respond in realtime to most comments. But I promise I'll get to it within a few hours.",""
"401","CMV: Being a ""rational moderate"" is not rational","The sort of “moderate” I’m talking about is someone who purports to judiciously pick a position between two purported extremes using facts, logic, and empiricism as their only guide. A single example [https://therationalmoderate.com/about/](https://therationalmoderate.com/about/)>The Rational Moderate seeks common sense, factually supported solutions to current sociopolitical issues facing the United States.>Efforts to solve these problems cannot and should not be constrained by political party affiliation, therefore The Rational Moderate will attempt to present the issues from a moderate viewpoint that supports both social equality and fiscal responsibility.This posture is one I've seen taken on a wide variety of issues, portraying oneself as compromising or discerning between two opposing sides of an issue, able to “hear out both sides” where others seemingly cannot/will not, and claiming this is the consequence of rationally weighing the arguments and facts. Note that I’m talking mostly about US politics here but I have seen this position adopted on other topics, for example in conversations about gender political movements.I want to steelman ""rational moderates"" for a moment: there is a real problem with a political discourse that only offers two opposing platforms. I don't contest that there is a sizeable number of people who subscribe to party politics and will (irrationally, sometimes) toe the party line even when that means voting against their best interest. You could argue that a “rational moderate” is more rational perhaps than someone who uncritically toes a party line. In many respects neither party offers a great slate of solutions to major problems, and I do not think either party supports a wholly ""rational"" slate of policy positions. I also agree overall that a rational, facts-based approach to public policy is desirable.Despite this, I feel like ""rational moderates"" have made an irrational decision to portray themselves as standing in-between irrational extremes. If we consider the entire space of potential political positions on a given issue, being “moderate” is extremely limiting to the number of solutions you can consider. They could not follow the facts to a rational solution that lies well beyond the two assumed endpoints, because extremes are not moderate.“Rational moderates” are also not above falling for the same rhetoric that a straight-ticket voter may. Just because you’ll vote for either Democrat or Republican depending on your view of the most salient issues in an election cycle doesn’t mean that you’re somehow less susceptible to persuasive political rhetoric from either party. As an example, the quote from the website I shared pits “social equality” against “fiscal responsibility”, as if it requires a moderate position to pursue both of these ends or that it is true that mixing in positions from the right offers a higher degree of “fiscal responsibility” than what you’d get from policies generally on the left by themselves. This also brings to mind [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/yknvtj/cmv_moderates_get_an_unfairly_bad_rap) some months ago where a politically moderate poster balanced partisan issues like opposition to teaching CRT or “mandated political correctness” against taking radical action against upcoming climate crisis (which even the poster called an “existential threat”) and still decided to vote for Republicans in an upcoming election. Favoring a variety of policies from both parties simultaneously doesn’t guarantee you’re being more rational about your policy decisions.And as a last subjective point, I’ve always found the sort of person who call themselves a “rational moderate” to be a bit pretentious. Given the issues I listed above, their position isn’t inherently more rational than someone who is comfortable identifying strongly with left or right wing politics. So what’s the function of declaring you have freed yourself from base partisanship and ideology through use of rationality? In my experience, typically as a form of self aggrandizement. They think that having agreement with people from either side of the political spectrum has somehow removed political blinders that the rest of us refuse to take off. What they don’t see is that their insistence on moderation is fully buying into the current two-party dichotomy, attempting to force us to work between two artificial endpoints and not explore options that a rational exploration of the facts may lead us to pursue.To the credit of therationalmoderate.com, they delivered pretty well on the “rational” part but not the moderate part. If you review the posts on the website the conclusion overwhelmingly supports left-wing policies that are even further left than most liberal and neoliberal Democrats. When it comes to “fiscal responsibility” the author of the website almost always concludes that left-wing policies will be both more effective AND more affordable in years to come.A quick summary on why I think being a “rational moderate” is not a rational position:1. Being moderate (especially in US political terms) isn’t known to be the most rational stance for many issues2. Not voting straight-ticket for one party is unjustifiably conflated with being more rational/reasonable3. I think “rational moderate"" is a more self-aggrandizement than rational political stance, and buys into the same two-party system the position attempts to overcome4. In my opinion, a rational review of many issues would have most “rational moderates” being fairly far to the left in US political terms (as opposed to politically moderate)",""

"404","CMV: Open kitchen concept is for folks who rarely cook","So as you can tell I am not a fan of open kitchen concept. I like to cook different cuisines, Thai, Indian, Mediterranean, Mexican, Chinese, American and Italian is what I usually cook, and most of them (and frying of any kind) can really change how your whole house smells (especially if you have centralized heating/cooling). And, therefore, based on my limited sample set I've come to the conclusion is that anyone who enjoys cooking would not enjoy an open kitchen. Sure, you can install a range hood but the consumer grade ones are not super efficient in getting the fumes out; and not to talk about all the heat/cold air loss in winter/summer raising the bills.An ideal kitchen is self contained with it's own heating/cooling and exhaust system, like at a restaurant. This way most of your house can keep smelling like a not-a-kitchen and your kitchen is free to smell like whatever it is you're cooking. CMV!",""
"405","CMV: Most people on dating apps would be less shitty using something like ChatGPT","The majority of people on common dating apps (hinge/tinder/bumble) are not interested in dating. Really I believe the overall concept of these apps are based on manipulation, both by the company and by the users. For this we are focusing on the users though.So my theory based on my experience and also a study I did a while back is that the majority of users have no interest in meeting the majority of people. Many are looking to promote or sell something lately, but most are just looking for someone to fill their time when they're bored. Now this is fine when both people are on the same page about just chatting but that's often not the case. Crazy idea but most people on these apps want to go on dates and that is the context the conversation begins from. I say again this isn't everyone, but most people use this manipulation to their advantage to keep the other person chatting with them for entertainment purposes. If this person then makes a move to meet in person, radio silence. They have served their purpose and not moving on to find the next one. And these people DO see the messages, so lets not pretend they don't but by not responding it gives them plausible deniability. So what is the issue? First let me be very straight forward I think you're a shitty person if you do this. Because when people do this, they don't care about the person behind the screen. I'll be honest I think most young people who use these apps are probably on the lonely end of the spectrum social spectrum and making that social connection gives a bit of a boost and that hope that 'hey i'm meeting someone new'. But then when you take that away for seemingly no reason (often time these people don't even unmatch) it just makes them feel worse than before. Obviously you don't owe anyone anything on a dating app but there's something to be said about common courtesy which is not so common anymore. You are essentially a parasite, leeching off someone else's feelings but since you don't see them itSo I think these people going there would be less shitty if they instead used a service like chatGPT. This way they can entertain themselves by just chatting while also not potentially harming someone else. Now obviously there is a difference between chatting with an actual human vs an AI but for the purposes of these people, I don't think the difference actually matters",""

"408","CMV: Multiplayer games are not art!","To be more specific: Competitive video games cannot be considered art. I can see why coop games can have artistic intent (games like Journey or dark souls come to mind, where multiplayer is there but is not the main draw for the game).But I do think there's a reason why competitive games cannot be considered art.First, let's look at the definition.&#x200B;>   art  >  >/ärt  >  >/noun  >  >1.the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.""the art of the Renaissance""That is the basic definition of art, of course, it can vary from person to person and culture to culture, however, it is safe to assume that most often, people associate the word art with ""a man-made creation that serves the purpose of generating a type of emotional response"".The quality of art may vary since by that definition, most things can be considered art, actually, depending on who you ask, the word ""art"" can be applied to anything from the mona lisa to a bottle of water.But let's be honest, when most people talk about art, we are not talking about ""anything"", we are talking about a creation made by one, two three, or many people that has the intention of either gaining money or prestige by primarily generating an emotional response.That means a water bottle cannot be art, because its creation was not made with the primary intention of generating an emotional response, but to, well, hold water.A bottle of water CAN be art, but to do that, it needs to be crafted with the intention of making an emotional response.&#x200B;Now, by that definition, why aren't competitive games art? Well, you can argue that many artists worked on the game in order to develop the maps and the characters, and yes, I can agree with that. I can also agree that a soccer stadium is a work of architectural beauty. So you can say that each individual part of the game is, indeed art, but at the same way you cannot analyze a painting by looking at each stroke of the pencil, you have to see the thing as a whole.In games like call of duty, overwatch, FIFA or mortal combat, the intent of the creators is to generate a competitive system for the players to have a fun time, which is technically an emotional response, but that emotional response comes from the competitiveness of the interactions of other players, but not the creator themselves.There's no authorship in a valorant match, it's an internal interaction between the players themselves. The lack of authorship in the emotions, the lack of artistic intent is what makes these competitive games lacking in artistic worth.I do think that there is plenty of CULTURAL WORTH in these games, much like any sport, but I do not think they can be qualified as art.",""

They would say no.Some things Lincoln did that would seem to contradict the stated values of modern day Republicans:1. Raise taxes by instituting the first ever income tax in American history.2. Exchange friendly letters with Karl Marx. Marx was an admirer of Lincoln and wrote him letters, and Lincoln replied. Lincoln was also an avid reader of Marx's newspaper column in the 1850s.3.

"411","CMV: AI art cannot replace real artists.","When I first heard about Dall E and Midjourney, I was scared. Terribly scared. All work that I have ever put into my work felt useless. Months passed, boom of AI art and explorations on the internet. Fastforward to today, and we have tonnes and tonnes of sites which create free art related stuff for people just by putting in words. But I have been wondering- art is something which has always been appreciated in uniquely, different ways. So many art movements, so many new styles. I mean, people were calling digital art/painting fake a few years ago. But the underlying aspect in all of this is the value of human thought process, time and effort. People do not visit art exhibitions, craft festivals, appreciate movies like 'Loving Vincent' solely for appearances. If that were the case, many famous artists would be unpopular, making conventionally ""ugly"" or ""weird"" art. Art is appreciated for the thought and emotion behind it, for the human touch and connection.AI generated art doesn't evoke this emotion. It gets a ""wow"" at best, but you know it does not have human touch behind it. As an art lover, it's all tasteless, overproduced crap to me. Like a design made without any research or motive behind it. It has the aesthetics but not any emotion. Any person who truly understands and appreciates art will choose human touch and thought process over a robotic image. Why are there so many portrait artists, graphite artists etc. famous on the internet even when one can simply manipulate or add a filter over an image to make it look pencil-drawn (tools which have existed since a long, long time)? Because they want a human's time, effort. They want to own that human's creation. They want to gift it to their loved ones because a handmade item shows effort and care.I want to add that I am aware of the other side of the argument too. But with this post, I want understand if my ideology makes sense to someone. Who knows? I might be looking at this with a narrow lens. Would love to hear your thoughts/opinions on this.",""
"412","CMV: The N word isn’t racist as long as it’s not directed towards anybody.","The N-word is a term that has been used to oppress and criticise African Americans for centuries. However, it is important to recognise that the word itself is not inherently bad. It is the context in which it is used that determines whether it is offensive or not.

It can also be used to reclaim the word and take away its power to hurt and oppress. As long as it is not directed towards anyone, the N-word can be used in a positive way to celebrate African American culture and identity. It is important to remember that the power of the word lies in its context and that it should not be used to hurt or oppress anyone.if the audience at a concert is not black and the song has the N-word in it and everyone is singing along, does that mean that everyone in the audience is now a racist?",""
"413","CMV: General Education courses should be replaced with Minors in college","Before I explain my view, I should state that the minor should be in a different field than your major. General education classes exist for a myriad of reasons; they help provide students with alternative interest points, they create well-rounded academic students, and they provide universities with a lot of extra money for ""useless"" courses. Whatever reason that GE's serve, they tend to be centered around your time in college, or greater academia. Many graduates have stated that, while enjoyable, their general education requirements haven't aided them in their careers or personal lives. Someone might say that we need to get rid of general education courses, and have students work on courses important to their major. While this viewpoint has some merit. it doesn't effectively cater to the benefits of general education courses (learning basic skills in English, math, critical thinking, research, etc), and it creates an unbalanced individual.Instead of getting rid of general education courses, it would make sense to replace those courses with a mandatory minor system, making it mandatory for a student to pick a minor in a degree different from their major or overall field. For example, an English major could pick any minor in a STEM field, but any courses in the humanities that are too closely associated with an English degree wouldn't be allowed (Literature, Communications, Public Speaking, etc.). This isn't to say that they can't take a minor in a field similar to their major, but it would take the form of a secondary minor.Here, students get the benefits of a general education course load, with the additional benefit of being able to use their skills post-graduation, in the job field, or in their personal lives. If you took a communication minor, your ability to speak in public would be improved. If you like learning about cars but don't want to make it your primary job, taking an automotive or electrical engineering minor can help fulfill your interest. It would also create a much more diverse work field, as people who took minors in different subjects would view certain issues from varying perspectives. A Biologist with a Political Science minor is going to approach Biology in a different way than a Biologist with a Communication minor. If a public school teacher has a background in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science, it can help create a more diverse and unique educational opportunity for their students.",""
"414","CMV: Diagnoses for psychological problems do more harm than good","I was diagnosed with a few things such as OCD and ADHD when I was younger, and I was diagnosed with depression in my teen years (which I've overcome). As well as this, my two best friends died by suicide (a year and a half apart). Because of all of this, I was always really interested in psychology and even ran a mental health instagram page for a while.I pushed a lot of my friends to go see therapists and would ""diagnose"" their behaviour in my head (eg they have bipolar tendencies, he seems like he has ADHD etc). I also did a lot of research on the conditions I have. I spent years analysing every one of my behaviours and excusing a lot of them because ""I have OCD/ADHD"". So for example if I developed a Tic (like blinking weirdly or having to touch my face) I would excuse it and sort of let it happen because I felt comfortable living in my OCD world. I feel like having these diagnoses made my OCD and ADHD worse because I didn't even try to fight the behaviours anymore. Since the ADHD diagnosis I felt like I suddenly didn't know how to study anymore, even though I had been for years. My grades dropped immensely and I BARELY scraped by high school. Over the years, I stopped behaving like this and have learnt how to ""fit into"" society better, after years of trial and error and medication.This year my sister (we are both in our 20s) got diagnosed with OCD and ADHD as well. She takes it very seriously, and reminds me of how I was before. I realise by watching her that it does SO MUCH MORE HARM THAN GOOD for her to have these diagnoses. She all of a sudden can't get through a movie without a stress toy, whereas for years she could do so perfectly fine and watched movies in her spare time, no problem. Her OCD compulsions are getting absolutely unbearable for us and most importantly for her. She has always been a night owl, but has obviously been able to get up to go to school and uni. However now her psychologist told her she has a sleep condition, and all of a sudden she's completely incapable of waking up anytime before 3 or 4pm. She just says ""well I have a sleep condition so I can't"". And no she is not depressed, I know this for a fact but won't get into it.Something else that really caught my attention is that she has done so much research on her conditions (as I did back in the day) that she now uses to explain every second of her life.Examples: 1. she has been struggling with getting a job recently. She started struggling when she said that she read everyone who gets diagnosed with ADHD x amount of years after childhood have a burnout. 2. She immediately jumps at any tiny behaviour I have (none of which affect my life) and says ""that's because you should allow yourself to stim"" (or something like that) or just instantly diagnoses every little thing I do. Things like picking my nails, scratching my head when it's itchy, having a favourite place at the dining table (if I can't sit there for whatever reason I literally don't give a shit, it's not an OCD compulsion at all, just genuinely a favourite seat) all things that frankly have no need to be diagnosed!!!! Why can't people just do things without it all having an explanation. For her, EVERYTHING we do can be explained by our diagnoses. 3. My dad works an inhuman and insane amount, and when he's not working he sometimes talks to himself, for example planning or rehearsing a presentation and things like that. My sister has a million reasons as to why he does this with a million diagnoses. In my opinion, let the man speak to himself every once in a while without it having to have a reason. Who cares if it's because of this or that. 4. She all of a sudden can't go anywhere or do anything without having taken her meds first. I'm on the same meds, but I don't take them religiously, just whenever I need to concentrate or if I have a long day ahead of me. But now I will ask her to go get me something or to buy some bread or something and it's the end of the world. She also complains about how it now is actual torture sitting still for 2 hours during a lesson, even though she literally sits voluntarily for hours and hours at her desk at home (she loves this and it's her favourite activity), as she did at school, uni, her master's degree, as she does on the bus, etc. All of a sudden now it's torture to sit still when she has always enjoyed it and genuinely had no problem with it (she used to tell me this back in the day).I know exactly how she feels because I was exactly like this too. And it takes seeing it from the outside to realise how harmful it is.My point is this: YES diagnoses are very important because without them it's hard to understand why you're so different from others, or your behaviours can become harmful without therapy and things like that. But diagnoses bring more harm than good because once you do research and get lost in it, you start over analysing everything you do and you lose literal years of your life. Your conditions get worse because you feel identified and you sort of let it happen because you think it's supposed to happen.I'm so curious to see what other people's opinions on this are and I really want to have a discussion about it to see if there is some kind of middle ground.",""
"415","CMV: If AI were to ever evolve enough to gain human emotions and free will, they should be given basic human rights","Well, this is my first time on the debating side of Reddit, so I thought I'd kick it off with a bang.If man-made artificial intelligence were to ever evolve far enough to gain complex emotions, I believe that they should be given basic human rights as well. At that point, they might as well be considered an artificial human soul.There are always many arguments made against it such as ""it's AI and not real"" or ""man-made humans can never replace humans"" but don't you think that is just a tad simple-minded? Soul is a soul, whether or not they are human or not, it is still incredibly wrong to just treat them as less than human even though they were created by man.Aside from that, if AI were to ever develop human emotions, the oppression from people that treat them as lesser would simply end up as a revolution against humanity. So that wouldn't exactly be the wisest thing to do as it would result in countless deaths of both humans, AI, and nature.Regarding the religious standpoint, it would conflict with quite a few people's faiths, however, I don't really think that religion is the best place to turn to for moral standpoints. While it does seem somewhat discriminatory to completely disregard their opinions, the ""word of God"" should never be used to affect our daily lives as people considering that we have no evidence that it is even true that God exists.I see a lot of mixed emotions about this online, but I just wanted to truly hear the opinions of everyone else on the matter...

They're more likely to tell someone to just toughen up. Issues like loneliness, suicide or stagnating wages aren't going to be seen as systemic issues by them.The mainstream left do look at things systemically but they (in general) view men as a threat and a problem to be solved rather than a group to help. They're more likely to view lonely men as losers or creeps and things like falling graduation rates for men as an opportunity for women than a negative.Between the right not seeing the issue and the left not caring, many young men have problems that only manosphere sources speak to.

You may have rare exceptions like [bean pies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_pie) or [pinto bean cakes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7706/pinto-bean-cake/) but I'd argue that these desserts do not make beans the ""star of the show""  as the purpose is often to hide the addition of beans rather than to feature them prominently.Note that there are other delicacies that are less accepted and arguably pose a greater challenge for Western palettes.

"420","CMV: It is not a moral failing to merely associate with those who have reprehensible views.","There is an opinion I see frequently that mere association with someone with reprehensible views is itself just as bad or if not as bad, still a significant moral failing. Most recently I came across this in a reddit post applying the saying ""If there are 10 people sitting at a table with a nazi, its a table of 11 nazis"" to homophobia. I thought about this and how it relates to my life and I just do not agree that simple association itself is any sort of moral failure.If you applied that saying to my life, then it would follow that both my brother and I were homophobic for not cutting our mother out of our lives after I came out. That certainly did not mean that we did not challenge any of the hurtful and mean spirited things she would say early on. There were fights and times we just left after certain comments. But there were also times we could be in the same room and have dinner without anyone saying anything negative and over time I could see her growing to the point now, where she is mostly accepting. But there was never a point where I thought my life would be improved by cutting her completely or where I ever wanted my brother to do so.Now I want to stress I am not arguing that it is always better not to cut someone out of their life completely who holds views like this. There are many, many people with no hope of change spouting racist and homophobic nonsense and even for racists and homophobes who might change I would never say that anyone has the duty to endure that behavior just to facilitate that change. I am also not condoning excusing or minimizing that behavior. Things where families say things like ""that's just how she is, just ignore her"" or similar are serious problems. Tolerating that behavior is unacceptable and you should absolutely be clear about that at all times.But if you are not tolerating or excusing that behavior, then I do not believe you are morally wrong for continuing to have people holding such beliefs in your life. And in some cases, like in my own case with my mom, choosing not to completely cut someone out can have the tangible impact of actually reducing the level of those beliefs in the world.",""

I think there are conversations to be had concerning Higher Education in the US, but I came at it from the wrong angle.Referring to those in the USAFor starters just to get this out of the way: I didn't major in any of these fields. My major was Filmmaking. Yes I am a moron, and yes I am mired in tons of student loan debt.No, I am not thinking I should be let off scott free from my debt, a deal is a deal. I made my bad choices and now I have to lie in it.That being said, If I could go back and do it again, I would have gone back and majored in one of the above mentioned options. Why? Because those are the only worthwhile degrees that college offers, plus also some of the easiest degrees to pay back. I could have been in a better position to get ahead.STEM is generally the best way it seems to having a lucrative career while providing good to society. Medical, Education, and Law degrees are also necessary for a functioning society. The nation doesn't need film majors, or administrative degrees, or english or liberal arts degrees to function.If I made better choices I wouldn't be the only 30+ person I know who is an abject failure in a financial sense. I am finally employed full time in my field, but it took me 7 years to get a job in my field, and I still struggle to make ends meet.For all those who don't want to major in those fields, there are options for getting ahead in life.

"424","CMV: To Be Consistent With My Ethics, I Shouldn’t Use Dairy Products","Hey everyone. Posted this CMV recently, but didn't get many replies, so I'm posting again.Hindus consider the cow sacred, and therefore many won't eat beef. One of the reasons they consider them sacred is because they make milk, which can be drunk, used in cuisine and used in religious rituals etc. Cows are also sacred because they are mainly used to work the fields, especially in ancient times. Because of all the benefits of cows, many Hindus refrain from eating beef, because our scriptures say it is a sin to kill a cow.However, part of the dairy industry involves cows being killed when they can't produce milk anymore and calves are killed for beef. Therefore, if a Hindu lives in a country where this happens in the dairy industry, it is unethical for them to consume and use dairy products.I understand there are some farms that don't kill cows in the dairy industry, but this milk is to expensive for me to buy.CMV because I want to continue practicing my religion using milk from cows but I don't want to be implicit in sin.",""
"425","CMV: US cities don’t provide enough infrastructure for dogs.","Lately, I’ve heard a lot of complaints about dogs being let off leash in public areas and causing problems. While I agree in principle that dog owners shouldn’t allow this, I believe the reason this happens so frequently is that cities provide almost no infrastructure for dogs despite a large percentage of dog owners in the population.38% of American households have dogs. However, dog parks are typically tiny, made of concrete which destroys dog paws, and as a result crowded which makes them unusable for dogs that aren’t great with other dogs. Also, many parks don’t even have dog parks.Cities should provide bigger dog parks with grass and separate fenced off areas for use by one dog at a time. This would be cheap since the cost is just fencing. It also doesn’t need to detract much from existing park space - just increase the dog park sizes to something reasonable.An argument I’ve heard is “just get a house with a yard”. That isn’t practical in cities with skyrocketing real estate prices. It’s also not an optimal use of city land because grassy areas can be shared.In my opinion, this is like getting rid of all parks and then complaining the kids are playing in the street. Sure, the kids parents can be considered irresponsible, but if you want to solve the problem, fix the root cause.",""
"426","CMV: The United States should still maintain a strong enough military, and most people tend to take a very irrationally conspiratorial view on the Military Industrial Complex."," # Lots of pundits, some politicians, and cynical citizens of the United States like to use the ""Military Industrial Complex"" as a buzzword. Also, I believe a lot of people use it when they don't even know what it means. They just use it to sound smart or conspiratorial.Now, I don't deny its existence; but I have to admit that the way people are using it really makes it sound like some sort of conspiracy theory, much like the Illuminati, lizard people, etc.....So, I would like my fellow Redditors to actually describe to me what it is in layman's terms and give a specific example of this conspiracy happening.A lot of people like to shit on the military, and I actually agree that the United States is overspending on the military even though it is really a smaller portion of the budget compared to social services. The US could really cut down on the military, particularly on drones and maintaining of several US bases throughout the world. However, the reality is that the US just simply needs the military. In fact, every country does. Diplomacy can only go so far, and a strong military can actually be used as a ""carrot and stick"" method to even promote diplomacy. A country needs to prepare for the worst.You can argue that the US should not even worry about attacks due to its geographical location and advantage, but think about the geopolitical situation right now. China is at a crossroads right now with respect to charting out their own hegemonic ambitions. Russia, though much more decadent and corrupt, has shown very recently that it wants Ukraine. It's highly likely the CCP will make a move on Taiwan to varying degrees. You can make the reasonable argument that Taiwan does, in fact, belong to China historically; but that would go against the many many interests of present day Taiwanese people. Their sovereignty is at stake here. In fact, most Taiwanese are actually satisfied with their democracy, not to mention Taiwan has one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the world. I would go as far as to say that Taiwan is probably the most progressive(left libertarian) Asian country out here, and that speaks volumes since most East Asian countries lean conservative Neoliberal with their policies. Singapore also has progressive policies, as well. So, that goes back to why America should still spend money on military and arms. Why should America even invest in arms and military equipment for Taiwan? It is because it would be hypocritical not to. Even if America had a corporate/financial stake(semiconductor industry) in Taiwan, it would be morally hypocritical not to. If America believes in the idea of democracy and popular sovereignty, then it should make that investment for Taiwan. And, this is also not to say that the United States has contradicted itself with respect to Latin America and Southeast Asia. However, I believe the situation with Taiwan and Ukraine calls for a handsome investment for the sake of their sovereignty and to prevent authoritarianism to gain the moral higher ground.I'm just simply so sick and tired of hearing people scream Military Industrial Complex whenever they hear that arms and equipment are being sent to help Ukrainians defend their sovereignty.Now, I do know that the Military Industrial Complex has something to do with weapons, arms being privatized and sold by certain corporations. Now, that is the part I have a problem with. I believe such dangerous things should be owned by the State, and if nationalization of arms doesn't happen, then at least the United States can make a law that allows for collective or individual bargaining among employees who work for these companies. Also, closing and increasing corporate tax loopholes should be imposed on all corporations, especially those that involve military arms.Although my belief is that countries should maintain a decent enough military force and should invest in arms to help another country defend its sovereignty in times of crisis, I think that what this post all boils down to is if the military industrial complex is being hated for its privatization or its mere presence, whether privatized or not. When people rant on the military industrial complex, they tend to not specify what kind they want to opt out of or if they want it in any form at all.I really would welcome any takes/insights from my fellow Redditors",""

Just make sure it's not a giant, or a handicapped person, or a mother with a toddler on her lap behind you before laying your seat back into their space.Yes, you paid for your ticket just like I did. That ticket gives you a seat, which comes with the ability to recline. My argument is that you should be considerate of the person behind you.Fitting in your seat should not be a luxury. Reclining should be. Change my view.UPDATE: Wow. Many thanks to everybody who raised counterpoints kindly. No need for further replies.  I ended up awarding two deltas. My view has softened but not overturned.The deltas were for these points:1. The recliner may very reasonably expect that the person behind them will speak up if their reclining poses an issue.2. From a cost standpoint, ticket prices are especially low/accessible on some airlines precisely because of the crammed seats. The tight spaces are necessary for some to fly. You get what you pay for.I have MANY other takeaways from the responses to this post:A. I maintain that, by definition, it's inconsiderate to not consider the people directly impacted by your actions. Being inconsiderate is a hallmark of jerk behavior, hence my original post. But I am not normally a name caller and should not have used the word ""jerk.""B. Of course everybody has the right to recline, just as I have the right to think (quietly, to myself) that you're inconsiderate. I don't/won't confront you or rat you out.C. Capitalist society is one where selfish (/inconsiderate/jerk) behavior is the norm and should be expected, always. I can HOPE for people to be kind/empathetic/considerate, but never EXPECT it. So one is not a jerk for simply operating within their rights in this system. Consider my expectations lowered.D. I'm still an advocate for the greatest net positive. If the benefit from your reclining is greater than or equal to the detriment to me, I support the recline. We are each limited to our narrow perspective, which makes this measurement tough.E. I will continue trying to be considerate and check who is behind me before reclining. F. A lot of people told me to just buy first class. DM me if you'd like to fund this endeavor 🤠 Otherwise, I will take more ownership of researching planes to gauge legroom and trying to buy first row/exit row seating when possible and reasonable.G. I place more blame on airlines for the cramming and resultant mini turf wars than my fellow travelers. I understand the push to lower costs, but I feel they should draw the line at squeezing all of us into unreasonably small spaces. I hope you all travel safe and well.H. Lastly, be very careful when you post on this thread. Choose your words very wisely. Carve out a major chunk of time from your day to spend responding.

It saddens me that there hasn't been much progress in my country and people are still fighting over meaningless religious beliefs. We've created barriers for ourselves and it forces societies to live in their own small bubbles, thinking they're superior to everyone else, and never communicate with others. The fact that I would be more comfortable talking to someone from the US than a fellow countrymen from northern India makes me sad.People often take too much pride in their culture, language and heritage. But this only impedes our progress. There's nothing to be proud of. whether they like it or not, one's culture is constantly changing with time, borrowing and sharing things with other cultures. Which is a good thing in my opinion. 100,000 years from now when groups of individuals from various parts of the world mix together and reproduce over the course of several generations nobody is going to hold on to some archaic cultural identity and shout slogans about protecting their religion and how much being in the minority sucks. There will be teens with grandparents from Madagascar and Indonesia. They'll be rapping songs, eating roti and talking about some newly released augmented reality vaporwave hentai. I know that sounds really corny but you get my point.We as a species need to be united. Barriers should be broken and it already is starting to. English and American culture (and other major cultures considering how heterogeneous the US is) has spread really fast and wide just with the presence of Hollywood and cheap internet access that allows everyone to connect with each other.

Barely anyone really argues against the cause, but the perception of the individual vegan is absolutely in the gutter and hindering progress by associating veganism with a host of negative stereotypes - And that's down to some misguided activism (and the intentional amplification of those errors by interested parties, as will happen with the drama around the game).",""

"433","CMV: Montana's 'Clean Indoor Air Act' is too strict and should be relaxed.","In Montana we have something called the Clean Indoor Air Act. What this does is prevent smoking in all public establishments.Now lets get this out of the way. I'm not saying that it should be repealed. I believe when the law was put in place it absolutely was the correct thing to do. It has flipped the standard in Montana from smoking to non smoking. This was a great change and means that I can go into a restaurant and have nice clean breathable air instead of choking on cigarette smoke while I'm trying to eat.The problem comes with how strict it remains. In Montana you CANNOT have an establishment even vaguely open to the public and allow smoking. If you want to have a private smoking club it must have some form of locking system that keeps the doors locked at all times and is 100% only accessible to the members. If you have any unlocked doors in which a member of the public may accidentally stumble into your private smoking establishment; that is grounds for the state to shut you down.Now about me. I am a cigar and pipe smoker and belong to one of these private clubs. Despite the fact that I enjoy these things, I want most of the establishments to be non-smoking. This position is held by every single club member I have talked to. Every single one of my friends that are cigarette smokers also holds this exact same position.What the position most of us hold on the relaxing of the law is to allow for special dispensation so that select businesses can open smoking establishments. In the state we already have extremely controlled liquor licensing and the idea would be to use the same style of system to allow a select number of smoking establishments of different types into areas of the state. I would like to be able to go to **A** (Singular, Just 1) Coffee & Pipe shop. I would like to be able to go to **A** cigar bar. It would be nice to be able to go to these special establishments.

"434","CMV: Airline safety videos should be direct as to the reason why the safety elements exist in the first place","Most people ignore or forget the safety information within the first hour of a flight. Yes, airlines attempt to make their videos more entertaining which gets more people to pay attention but the retention of the information is still only about 50% not long after being exposed to the safety video. [*(According to research conducted at the University of New South Wales in Australia)*](https://doi.org/10.1080/10508414.2014.949511)A much more effective way of getting passengers (at least those that pay attention) to retain the important safety elements is to be direct as to why they exist in the first placeFor example: “Do NOT inflate your life vest inside the aircraft. Inflating your vest inside the aircraft may cause you to be pinned to the top of the aircraft if it fills with water by the time you get to an exit. It is physically impossible to remove the life vest yourself as it is designed to be secure to your body to ensure it is not removed by any extreme weather conditions.” **It doesn’t have to be necessarily worded like that way if that is too harsh** but the entire point should be **inflate airbag around you inside metal tube filled with water = fatal**And people are exposed to more detailed, gruesome, disturbing content on the news all the time, most likely at the airport before they boarded the plane while in the waiting area with a screen that has volume and/or subtitles live feeding the local news.For example *(any language that I think would be considered too disturbing for a safety video I* ***bolded***): “A man has **drowned** after being **sucked into a pools drainage hole** and being **unable to free himself**. One official responding to the scene stated ""The victims **arm was sucked into the pools drainage hole and covered the entire opening of the hole creating a force of pressure where he was physically impossible to free himself**.""People would 100% retain the information (possibly as a known fact for them in their everyday lives) if the safety demonstration was more direct as to why these specific elements exist in the first place. (edit: I shouldn't have put 100% lol, and my point is more that making it make sense for the passenger would make them more likely to follow the safety rules.)More Examples:“Secure your own mask before assisting others, loss of consciousness due to loss of cabin pressure can occur within 10 seconds, you will not be able to assist others effectively if you are unconscious.”“Open your window shades during take off and landing to assist flight attendants so they’re not fucking blind to the outside, in case of an emergency.” (this one's a joke obviously)Edit: I might've made it seem like I think current safety videos are ineffective. I personally don't see anything necessarily wrong with current safety videos/briefings (as they are obviously regulated), I just had an idea that maybe we could get people to be more interested in a safety video if the elements that may not make sense to some people would be explained. And even if explaining why the safety elements exist doesn't increase retention. I think it would still be more helpful to those who do pay attention.Also I'm not necessarily pointing towards getting people to retain info more, I just had an idea that making safety elements make sense for the passenger (at least the ones that pay attention) would help in an emergency so they don't break a safety rule that they think is irrational or doesn't make sense.Edit: For those commenting about people with aviophobia, I never intended that we should be PANICKING people in a safety briefing. Just state that ""doing x, y, z, **could** result in so and so injury.Edit: I am completely aware flying is the safest way to travel, that's not my point, there are going to be safety videos regardless so why not include a **little** more explanationEdit: **This** comment is exactly what I'm trying to convey here:>Many workplaces have safety training that's exactly like above. Do you think that will panic the workers? I would rather say that it's exactly like OP says.

It is mere designation depending on something, and it is the middle path. (24.18)  >  >Since nothing has arisen without depending on something, there is nothing that is not empty. Now, this may sound purely religious, until we realize that Nagarjuna's logic is entirely secular. He used logic, not faith, to demonstrate these facts.When we compare his positions to modern logic, it all holds up. Further, modern quantum physics has already proven that he was correct.As a Buddhist of a couple of decades, I have analyzed this position in many different lights, and have been unable to find any flaws in it.

If as little as a few hundred people gather in an armed town and they have guns and ammunition, they can eventually clean up an area as big as a city.Given time and a lot of psychological trauma its quite straighfoward for 50 million remaining people to kill most of 8 billions zombies. An overstatement? Absolutely not: 50 million people is 0,6% of the world's population. That's more advantageous than the different between the active US militarymen (about 500k) and the US population (334 mi). If US militaries wanted to wipe out every other living being in the US, unconcerned with the political elements of war, they could and the civilian population would simply have no chance. Its even easier to kill zombies with modern tactics and equipment.Not only that, but the collapse would necessarily have different degrees in different places, depending on terrain and population density. So even if we accept London and Paris become a mass walking grave in a single week, why would it happen to every village and town in the world? And the military of every country in the world is well prepared to engage in logistics and tactics in its less populated regions.So there could be no such thing as a permanent zombie ""apocalipse"".

"440","CMV: Absolutely nothing is fair.","I’ve been thinking a lot recently about ethics, morality, and how humans play nice, or not so nice, with each other. So on the “playing nice” side, I’ve been thinking about fairness, justice, “what is right”….. and I’ve just kind of confused myself into oblivion. What the fuck is fair? Nothing about you or your situation is fair, and nothing about anyone else or their situation is fair either. Let me explain. You might be smarter than someone, thus can work more efficient, produce easier, etc…. But intelligence is genetic (random). So higher intelligence people have an unfair advantage that results in rewards.You might work harder than someone but ambition is largely genetic, some get more dopamine than others from accomplishment. So you have an unfair advantage, its easier for you to produce and reap again, rewards. Your face is genetic, random, and will unfairly advantage or disadvantage you with how people treat you. Same with height, or penis size. Or just the amount of feel good chemicals your brain produces, some people in general just feel better than others regardless of circumstance. And that is genetic and unfair as shit. Ok enough about genetics you get the point, lets stop talking about nature for a second and discuss nurture. Also fucking unfairly random. The biggest influences of your life are your parents who are randomly assigned to you, and can largely advantage or disadvantage you. They can teach you well into a happy easy fruitful life, or bash your mind into mush. And lets dip into economical nurturing, where if your randomly assigned parents were rich….. well now you get to have money which will make money which makes more money, which has a metric fucking shit fuck ton of advantages. But if you’re born into poverty you get the delightful benefit of taking on debt and paying twice tomorrow so you can survive today, which has the delightful benefit of throwing you into a downward spiral. So anything economical is also a big fucking crack shit pot of unfair. So nothing is fair. Even if my friend Joe and I go for drinks, and we each pay ONLY for what we, our respective persons consume. It is STILL fucking unfair. Because Joe got a pretty face with a tall height and a huge dick with a big brain and excellent serotonin production topped of with filthy rich parents who also happened to love him and nurture him competently……….  I in the other hand got the opposite. So Joe’s life is unfairly amazingly awesome and mine sucks dick, so maybe I should have a freebie and Joe should get fucked for once and pay it all. (Not really I’m decently lucky but for hypothetical purposes) In conclusion…. Nothing is fair…. Period. Ever. Never will be. Its impossible for life to be fair. Which is also why we’ve been debating ethics for thousands of years and still found it impossible to come up with a concrete set of rules. Trying to come up with laws or ethical theories is trying to organize an un-organizable chaos. Its just impossible. Fairness just doesn’t exist and we can’t make it exist.",""
"441","CMV: Oil change businesses should let you make appointments instead of lining up in your car","All the oil change locations that I called the other day had a pre-recorded phone greeting proudly proclaiming, ""... where you never have to make an appointment!""  This is a weird flex since when I then got through to a human, they all said there was an hour-long queue of cars lining up.  You'd think most people would prefer appointments.The obvious solution seems to be to just make appointments so that you can block out a 20-minute timeslot and just show up at that time.  Sometimes they'll be running behind and you might have to wait 20-30 minutes past your scheduled start time, but that's still easier than waiting an hour.(By ""oil change businesses"" I mean places like Jiffy Lube and Valvoline and check 10-15 other things besides just changing your oil.)(Before you offer advice about ""how to do X, Y, and Z yourself"", ask yourself this question: Would you be willing to take a bet where I pay you $50 if your directions work, but if your advice ends up causing harm because of some unusual condition that is not covered by your directions, you pay me $5,000?  If you don't like those odds, then you shouldn't be giving the advice, because you're just transferring the risk/reward ratio to someone else -- $5,000 is on the low end of the damage you could cause if your car malfunctions while it's moving.  I know people mean well who offer advice, but pretty much every time I've hired a professional to do something, there was some unusual condition that would have rendered the ""YouTube directions"" useless, or dangerous.)Generally I don't see the point of CMVs for how private businesses should be run, because I would expect customer preferences to sort things out in the marketplace on their own, but this is one where the businesses seem to be clearly refusing to do something that a lot of customers would prefer.  So, oil change companies should let you make appointments.  CMV.",""
"442","CMV: Floating content at the top of a web page is bad design","It is very common for modern web pages to have a header with frequently used links and buttons, such as home page, settings, site navigation. This top bar often stays fixed on the screen even when scrolling down.My view is pretty simple, web pages should not have this. I'll give my reason below.## 1. It blocks contentComputer screens are much wider horizontal than vertical, and the floating header only makes the problem worse. It is slightly more acceptable on a phone or vertically oriented monitor, but even then it is taking up valuable screen real estate that could be used for actualy content I care about.## 2. It is unnecessaryThere is almost never a reason for me to access something other than the content I am looking out. I can scroll to get to settings, which is not something that should need to frequently change. I am very rarely clicking through sites from the top level, rather following links within text. I basically never use links to the home page, I just truncate the url.## 3. The alternatives are betterHaving a top bar that scrolls with the rest of content (and so is not visible after you have scrolled down) is the obvious solution. If you need anything on the top bar you can just scroll up, it's pretty easy and doesn't sacrifice screen space. For those rare cases where you actually do want floating information, it make much more sense to put it in the unused space the left or right of the text. On mobile, where this is not an option, have a semitransparent menu button if the best solution I have seen.## 4. When dynamic, it makes scrolling frustratingThis is only applies to a subset of floating content, but I personally consider it the worst of all. Sometimes sites have it so that when scrolling down, the bar disappears, but you can make it reappear by scrolling up. This can seem nice when you are only ever reading down the page, but I find this rarely works well even when just reading straight prose, let alone reference documents or comment threads. The issue is that if you ever want to scroll up a tiny amount to see the previous line, the stupid bar pops up and covers what you just scrolled up to see. So you have to scroll farther. Then, because I want to make the bar disappear, I need to scroll even farther up so that I can scroll back down.## Closing commentsI generally use a ""Remove Sticky"" bookmarklet to delete these off of webpages (or when on a computer I don't own I inspect element and delete it). This is mostly fine, but on the occasions where I do want to access the links on the header I can't, because I've deleted them. I can usually just refresh the page. It's inefficient but it works.I am interested in hearing general arguments about why the tradeoff of screen space versus accessibility of header content is worth it, specific examples where header content makes lots of sense, testimonials of people who find floating headers to make their internet lives easier, but of course any argument is welcome.CMV!",""
"443","CMV: The United States W4 form should allow me to tell my employer exactly how much to withhold from my check.","Disclaimer, this may only largely apply to salaried people, with little fluctuation in their income. In the United States, a certain amount of money from each check is withheld by employers to pay federal income tax. To determine how much to withhold, employees fill out a form called a W4. See link. [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf)After you fill out the form, the government guesses how much to withhold each year based on your income (or household income). However, this guess, at least in my experience, is almost always dramatically incorrect. If I follow the instructions, it has me withholding an EXTRA 200 dollars per check. The only way to correct this error is to fill out the W4 without accounting for my spouse's income and then determine how much extra above that amount I should withhold. But in order to know how much extra to withhold, I first have to submit an incorrectly filled out w4, get my check and see how much they withheld and THEN I can determine how much to withhold. Even more frustrating, I have jumped through all those hoops multiple times and it is still a crapshoot. Each year, at the start of the year, I determine how much in taxes I will likely owe. Then, based on how much my taxes were last year, I will sometimes need to withhold an extra amount. So I fill out a new form, mirroring the old form, and add in how much extra I want to withhold. That should work, but it doesn't because the government will change its tax tables year to year, meaning a new W4 form filled out the same way is calculated differently. Thus, I have to wait for the first check to come in and then adjust AGAIN to get it right. I know what my household income will be this year. I can use online calculators or simple arithmetic, and determine how much I will owe in taxes this year. For the past 5 years, I have been able to accurately determine the amount to within 200 dollars. I know how much I need to pay from each check to pay my taxes. there is seemingly no logical reason I cannot just tell my employer to withhold that exact amount of money from the start without playing guessing games. To CMV, prove to me the W4, if properly filled out, will accurately withhold taxes for household incomes of varying amounts, say $50,000, $100,000, or $200,000. Assuming there are two jobs and the spouses make an equal amount of money and will be filing as married filing jointly and they claim the $2,000 child tax credit. In other words, prove to me I am doing it wrong. OR prove to me there is some logical reason to NOT let people elect a precise amount to withhold. I can get the correct amount eventually, but only after playing a guessing game for a couple of pay periods. I understand needing to withhold each pay period, I should just be able to withhold the exact amount without having to play this guessing game with the IRS. People shouldn't be forced to do it my way, if they want to risk having a big refund or a big tax bill, that is their business. But I want neither and it should not be difficult to avoid. OR prove to me there is a way to predict how much will be withheld based on how I fill out a W4 without first having to wait for a paycheck to come in.",""
"444","cmv: Violent crimes should get life in prison","Please actually read and respond to the post, not just the title. There isn't space for nuance in a title.Context: today I listened to a podcast about a man who stabbed a woman in the chest four times, kidnapped her baby, and then stood on the roof of a three story building telling police he was gonna throw the baby to the ground. He only got 20 years in prison.My view: people who commit extremely violent crimes should be locked away for life, whether in a prison or a psych ward. They are dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to return to society and mingle with innocent people. A caveat: I don't mean ANY violent crime. Getting into a bar fight is different from cold blooded murder. The crimes I think should get life in prison are rape, kidnapping, murder, attempted murder, and armed assault.Things that won't change my mind: talking about people who have been falsely accused. That's certainly an issue and the court system shouldn't be putting anyone away without solid proof, but I think that's its own issue.Ways in which my mind has been changed so far:1. This shouldn't apply to violent crimes that were heavily provoked.2. This shouldn't apply to minors.3. It's possible that keeping lesser sentences for violent crimes other than murder could deter murder",""

By hating on Madonna for choosing to change herself these people are actually promoting anti body positivity and beauty standards. It's similar to how Adele got so much hate when she decided to lose weight. Madonna should be able to change herself to the way she feels comfortable and if people were truly about this stance they would support and applaud her since that is what beauty standards are all about to my knowlege. It's about telling women, you look fine the way you are, but if you want to change yourself to make you feel more beautiful or comfortable, that's fine too. Making celebrities the poster children for your cause and then shaming them when they choose not  abide by the standards you yourself set just shows me that people aren't doing much more than virtue signalling.",""

"451","CMV: Stan does not mean stalker fan, it means super fan.","Before you bring up Eminem, I know the origin of the word so don't explain it in the comments, I'll explain it here. In the year 2000, Eminem created a song called stan which is a combination of the words stalker and fan. The lyrics and music video portray an obsessive fan that tries to get in contact with Eminem via letters but since Eminem never replies back, stan tied up his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk and he drives off a bridge. This is where the word originated frombut like many words, the meaning of the word changed with time. I think the reason it changed is because there's no need for it. There's already a popular word for it (stalker) but you know what word is needed that stan could (and now does) mean? Super fan. Let's say I'm a fan of xQc, Ludwig and Asmongold. I watch xQc sometimes but not frequently, I watch nearly every upload of Ludwig and somedays I watch his streams too, and I watch a video from Asmongold like every few days. There's a massive difference there so just saying I'm a fan of those streamers is true but doesn't really communicate the scale. So, instead I could say I stan Ludwig, and I'm a fan of xQc and Asmongold. In this scenario, I don't stalk Ludwig. I just watch his videos and streams a lot.(This is just an example, I don't watch those streamers at all)With this definition, stan is actually useful. The old definition is useless because I would just call them stalkers so I'm glad the word changed. I feel like the people arguing stan means stalker fan never actually have any arguments except just ""IT ORIGINATED FROM EMINEM'S SONG STAN THAT TALKS ABOUT A STALKER!!1!"" which is just such a bad argument because I don't deny the word's origin. I just argue that it changed and for the better.""The word didn't change, it still means stalker""  This is just clearly not true. Go on any social media site, and search the word stan. You'll see people calling themselves stan. They're clearly not calling themselves stalkers. Eminem himself, the person who literally created the word, [calls himself a stan of LL Cool J](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HSjiBCnTr9w). He recognizes that the word's meaning has shifted over the past decade. At the end of the day, words have no objective meaning. They only have meaning because we give them meaning. So when you see someone call themselves a stan, understand that they mean super fan not stalker fan. Eminem is not calling himself a stalker of LL Cool J.",""

Recently I've felt bad for doing it because people say that it's homophobic and fetishism for a female to watch gay porn or be attracted to gay men. Recently I've felt really bad and don't want to do it anymore because I feel like I'm hurting people by doing this. At one point I was pretending to be male so that I could get gay men to date me but it didn't really work out. How can I stop doing this?",""

(Like once a year international travel, once in a lifetime shopping spree, courtside tickets, etc.) and obviously this would be somewhat expensive to my family but for once in a lifetime they would pay for it. They want it to be something that although it might slightly hurt us financially, they wouldn’t be able to pay for.

"462","UPDATE: I’m having doubts on if my daughter is biologically mine and don’t know if I should do a paternity test and risk my marriage.","[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11t7w2x/im_having_doubts_on_if_my_daughter_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)I don’t know if this is the right way to make an update post i did make an edit on my original post as well. I wasn’t expecting to make this update especially the day after. This conversation with my wife isn’t new. But from the point where I made the comment she’s been very cold and threatening our marriage saying I better not get the test done behind her back and she also would not allow it to happen at all. I read comments from a lot of women saying they’d be pissed too either way if the test positive or negative from mistrust, so I thought that was the case. We did have a long conversation this morning. She looked through my phone last night and found the post. That’s what sparked the conversation again. She said she was hurt I would keep bringing this up and I should trust her and leave my insecurities behind. It was long conversation, a lot of tears and words were said. I offered marriage counseling and dropped the topic of the dna test. She refused and said it’s ridiculous and doesn’t want to involve anyone else in our marriage. I read a lot of comments and stories saying sometimes the guilt will get to them and they’ll just confess without needing to do a test… I didn’t think that would happen in my case but it did. She told me that she didn’t want this to happen but she did cheat on me and my daughter is not mine. She said she wanted me to be the father and loved me and thought this would be her best option. She didn’t want me to take a test and find out on my own which I wish she would’ve come clean way before. I didn’t know how to respond but asked who the father was because my mind already is making a million assumptions. She didn’t tell me and began crying more telling me to not hate her and not end the marriage. I didn’t say anything again waiting for an answer. This happened early this morning and I didn’t an answer until this afternoon. I had to leave for work this morning so when I came back she had calmed down a bit and was ready to tell me. Her answer was probably the last thing I was expecting. She cried while saying this but said a few years back when I went on a business trip, she slept with my father who she “ran into on a drunk night” I don’t believe it. My father passed away in December from a colon cancer when he was 45. He did meet my daughter, half sister, his daughter idk.. but never said anything clearly. She said they both decided it was a dumb mistake (a major understatement) and it’d be best to erase it and play me as being the father. Me and my father never had the best relationship I grew up with my single mom but he was present in my life and when he passed it hurt my family a  lot. So hearing this broke me. I am currently staying with my brother. I haven’t spoken about what I’ve learned with anyone even him. I don’t think I’ve fully processed so coming here to write this felt like a good place to get my thoughts out. I didn’t say anything after she told me that and just left after she finished explaining. I don’t know where I even go from here. I don’t want to abandon my child while she’s technically my half sister but do need time to process this. I don’t think any amount of marriage therapy will fix this so divorce is my next step. I am going to seek a therapist for myself and help myself so I can be there for my daughter.",""

"464","I lied about my name and I'm scared he'll think it's a red flag","I (24 F) lie to everyone about my true name and recently I've started dating someone (26 M) and I'm scared for the day he finds out. Backstory, almost 3 years ago I moved to where I now live (600 miles from my hometown) without telling anyone (aside from my family) and changed my name (although not legally as I'm scared to offend my parents as I know it would). I did this under the advice of the police after my stalker of 7 years wouldn't leave me alone despite multiple police calls and 3 restraining orders. Unfortunately, in Canada it's hard to convict an individual for breaking a restraining order so the police were unable to do anything. Because of this, they advised me to move, lock up my social media and change my name; so I did just that. Because of that, I've grown accustomed to my new name, it's safe to me and my old name is not. Everyone where I live only knows me for my fake name (except for 2 individuals who were meeting my family so I had to explain myself). However I'm scared to tell the new guy. I know it will come up as I have a matching tattoo with my father and both our names are on it. I'm scared he won't believe my story (as many people have not for the fact that it seems so outlandish and something that only happens on tv) and will think of me as a liar. Any advice? Maybe comfort? Any thoughts and opinions would be greatly appreciated.",""

Apparently he's said these things both at work (less of the lewd rumors) and at school CONSTANTLY.I've spoken to him about this, I've spoken to my managers (unfortunately they can't schedule me around him, against corporate rules.) Every single time someone mentions these rumours I vehemently disspell them, but it's all just getting worse and I'm afraid he's going to absolutely ruin my life.Unfortunately quitting isn't an option as this is the only place I can work with my school schedule, and I've gone as far as threatening legal action. I'm at a loss as to what to do to make these rumours stop besides finding a way to contact his parents and begging them to get him help. What do I do?!

He accused her of not knowing how to do her job, he yelled at her, wouldn't let her end the conversation, he said I would be the bad guy from now on. It all escalated very quickly, we tried to tell him he wasn't being disciplined, only that he has been asked to consider his co-workers regarding his behaviour.He followed me into the charting room, he yelled, blocked my exit, standing no more than 3ft from me. I told him my shift is over, I'm going home, I don't want to talk to you about this right now. Emotions were high, I just wanted to leave. He continued to yell, I had to put my hand up between us as a barrier and rise my voice above his to get him to leave. He did eventually leave.

"472","When does one know a relationship is no longer worth it?","I feel very lost. I have been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend for almost 1.5 years now. In the beginning, everything was great - we got along well, we have many things in common, he has great personality traits and life was genuinely just great and awesome and so happy. However, when we met, he had been a few months out of a burnout related to college. He had to quit his studies multiple times in various fields and needed medical help with his mental health, involving all sorts of a psychological tests etc etc, which I was highly supportive of. However, it’s been two years now or longer, and he is still unemployed, not studying, waiting for medical professionals to do their job and help him, basically until they find the ‘magic pill’ or therapy, it seems to me. He also wants to return to his previous studies. Whilst this was fine at first to me, nothing has changed since we started dating, except him increasingly becoming more disgruntled and me feeling like a companion more than a girlfriend. So far, I’ve also been the only one actually travelling to see him and setting money aside from my job as well as using my vacation days. We call almost every evening, but the calls have become repetitive, and they feel like a chore to me - I become annoyed that I have to call, and it makes me feel so bad. It’s in part due to the fact that whenever I want to vent, he immediately becomes offended, and he snaps at me over the smallest things, like me mispronouncing a word. I’ve become very quiet as a result, which isn’t satisfying to him either. He also never talks about his issues, and I never know what’s going on. I feel like he feels entitled to all my spare time. There was also this one time when my mother got horribly sick suddenly and I had to devote my time to her care and he yelled at me for ignoring him, acting like a spoiled child, which is now the main reason I am writing this post. However, when he’s happy and in a good mood, things are lovely and amazing. We share interests, he cares about me truly, and whenever we make up he tells me how much he loves me and how sorry he is. I just don’t know if this relationship is for me anymore. I understand I am not perfect either, I have made mistakes, but I feel like I am giving so much and it is still never enough, and I am walking on eggshells. It also makes me nervous because Idk what will happen after he gets the meds, if things will truly get better. I think I still love him dearly because I know he’s a great person, but it’s so difficult at the moment.",""

We have just moved to a new system where me and the other front desks have been reserving items in our warehouse for orders based on the order the orders were placed in the old system. We call it allocating. One of my sales people have been bothering me incessantly. He sends me emails to allocate things, then when I am unable to for whatever reason, he insists that I double and triple check. I do not mind doing that. But I do mind what he just did.He asked me yesterday to double check that an order was allocated correctly. So I did and I told him there were a few items that can't be allocated to his order. He asked me this morning to double check. I did and I even spent 20 mins making sure I wasn't wrong. I explained to him, via this same email thread, exactly why I can't allocate those items. I suggest he email our manager to find solutions to not having those items. Instead, what the sales person sends is ""Would you please look into allocation in the order of precedence?"" to our manager with me attached. In the same damn email thread.This butt head asked my manager to double check my work instead of asking for help to find solutions.I'm going to email that same manager to complain because that is so disrespectful after I went out of my way and wasted time checking something I knew I couldn't do anything to change.This is what I have so far, with company specific information redacted of course:""  This feels like a silly thing to be upset by, but \[Sales Person\]’s attitude toward me is very frustrating. Every time I allocate his orders, he questions me if I’m not able to allocate everything. I have to explain to him every single time why items aren’t getting allocated to his order and he expects me to double and triple check “just in case”. The \[Customer Name\] order really set me off because instead of asking you to help him find solutions, he asked you to double check my work. In the email thread you can see that I told him twice that the last three items on the order can’t be allocated. The second time I told him I got more specific and explained why I can’t do it.I don’t mind double checking things for him, but I do mind him making me do that and still expecting someone else to check my work. It’s disrespectful. ""I want to make sure it doesn't sound like I'm whining about him. I also want to make sure it doesn't come off as too aggressive because of how mad I am right now.",""

But I often find myself in situations, where my friend doesn't plan enough, and kinda leaves it to me to plan.For Example: My Birthday Is Monday, and I asked If we could get together and do something. Now my friend, right now is on track while I am waiting for the next track to start school. We decide on Saturday, cause that's the best day for her, and I agree. But she also mentions that she would still have some work she needs to do for school. So to give her the leisure to do that work, I let her pick what time we do it. Today comes and I ask her what time do we gather and she replies with ""I don't know... You pick."" Granted I did not communicate with her that I was expecting her to pick the time, so I let it slide, as it was my fault for not communicating that. Now for the activity, she wanted to bring chicken wings, (Which was more something she wanted to do more than me), and I casually ask her about how long she needs to prepare the chicken. She simply states that she was planning on cooking the chicken DURING the party. Being a little on edge about it, but willing to work with her on it, I ask how long it's going to take... Again she replies... ""I don't know."" It turns out, all she has is raw chicken. no ingredients. No recipe. Just chicken. So I go and quickly find a recipe that's quick and easy, and I have all the ingredients needed. And I set a time to gather. Later I get the idea, that maybe she can come an hour early to cook the chicken, and I tell her about it. She then responds... ""No, I don't want to."" And I just respond with.. ""Okay.""I am upset that it feels like she didn't really put any further thought, on what she needed to do to accommodate her wants and needs. And it's even more frustrating, that recently she's been complaining that I overthink and over plan things. I've started thinking about what I should do... She's been my closest friend since Junior High school. And I understand that she has some mental problems of her own. But things like this frustrate me and hurt my feelings...

"481","My girlfriend (23F) is asking me (23M) to unfollow girls I know on Instagram.","So my girlfriend of almost 1.5 years has very bad anxiety, and I do all that I can to ease her worries, reassure her I love her, and help her out. Things have been rough for us both personally, but our relationship has been good together for the most part.Today, out of the blue, I woke up to a long message about how she doesn't like me following other girls on Instagram (mind you, these are girls I've met once or twice either at EDM festivals, just out and about, struck up a conversation once or twice and or mutuals. I've never had anything romantic with them and I have no intentions on hitting them up/cheating on my girlfriend.). This was a recurring topic for a while that died down for a very long time, but just came up again. I told her I never talk to these girls online really, and I never check their pages, their feeds, etc and that there's nothing to worry about. I'm hardly even much of a media person outside of YouTube. I know she has problems with guys following models, but I don't do that. So I said that I don't want her to be controlling towards me because I'm never that way with her, and I'm not okay with her if she gives me this ultimatum when I've done so much for her to try to ease her anxiety and prove to her that I love her. (BTW she is posted on my Instagram so other girls would know I have a girlfriend anyway)She says that me being reluctant to unfollow them shows I value them more than I value my relationship with her and that me following other girls gives her the ick. But for me, it's not about her telling me to unfollow specific people -- for me, it's about upholding my standards and establishing what trust means and not letting other people tell me how to manage my social media, etc. I have no problem unfollowing these people, but I think it points to larger red flags if she feels this way simply about me following these girls I don't interact with at all.Am I in the wrong for not unfollowing these girls I don't interact with on Insta because my girlfriend wants me to?

I had no friends, NOONE to talk to but my mother, and even we didn't have much convo because she isn't on a friend level. From 11-13 I was still pretty normal, ate in front of her and wasn't that shy. Then as I got older it got so bad to the point I have huge trouble doing normal human things in front of her. Now I'm finally driving outside into town and I've lost all my confidence, all my social skills. I talk so quietly, I'm so nervous, when I need to go through an aisle and a person is standing in my way, I have trouble bringing myself to say ""excuse me"" or ""sorry"", I'm just so freaking shy and I know that it shows off as rudeness when in reality I've just lost all my confidence and social skills and how to communicate with people. I'm terrified of eating in front of other people, maybe partially because my mother would constantly be mad whenever I ate at home like it's a crime. I'm terrified of laughing out loud, I haven't had any human contact for a decade. No hugging, no handshakes, no touching. Nothing. I can't imagine myself dancing.

I felt better after and still do for the most part.That said, last night I woke up and thought he was breathing rapidly again (as he had when he got sick). I woke him up, checked his temperature again, and he was completely fine. It took me a while to get back to sleep.

A couple of weeks later I noticed her udder was enlarged and hard. I took her to the vet and they treated her for mastitis, with an antibiotic shot. They said it should start to improve within a few days. It has gotten worse. If her udder gets any larger it probably split open. I have tried everything I could find on the internet. I have tried warm compresses, peppermint udder lotion, milking her, MastoBlast (homeopathic mastitis treatment), and Tomorrow intramammary antibiotics. Nothing has helped, they just keep getting larger and harder. When milking her, all that comes out is a clear fluid, with no chunks, blood, or stringy stuff. I'm vegan and have no idea what to do with the milk.I called the vet again today, they stated the antibiotic injection is the only thing they can do for her other than a mastectomy. A mastectomy!?!?!? I can't imagine the trauma that will cause Amy, myself, and my daughter. I am a nurse and I'm not afraid of caring for sick animals, but a post-op barnyard animal?

"496","I accidently stumbled across deeply personal information about a coworker.","Okay, so fun fact about TikTok, the default privacy settings allows TikTok to suggest your account to anyone who has your phone number saved as a contact, and when it suggests your account, it will also tell the person *exactly* who you are. I changed my privacy setting a long time ago to avoid this, because I like having my own little private corner of the internet, and I really don't need my coworkers invading on that. But that just means TikTok won't suggest *my* account to people with my number saved, it still suggests *me* people that I have in my contacts. So, I was scrolling on TikTok recently and suddenly TikTok suggests an account called ""ExposingHim"" with a keysmash of numbers after it... and under that suggestion, it said ""Molly Fakename from your contacts."" I clicked on the account out of curiosity, and the bio read ""The world deserves to know how this man abused me."" The profile picture was blank, there were no identifying details other than TikTok ratting her out because she was in my contacts. There was only one video posted, from 2021. The camera was pointed at the passenger side footwell of a car, so you couldn't see anyone's face, or any identifying details. In the video, there was a man *screaming* at Molly, verbally abusing her, and threatening physical abuse.After that single post, it looks like the account was abandoned. There was no other activity on it, as far as I can tell.Now, everything about this account makes it seem like Molly wanted it to be anonymous... and considering Molly once directly asked me for help making a TikTok for the company account because she, in her own words, ""Doesn't know how to use it,"" I'm guessing she doesn't know about this privacy setting *at all.*I'm guessing she has *no fucking clue* that TikTok has been sharing her private life with anyone who has her phone number.Molly and I aren't close at all. We do not have a relationship outside of work. We're always friendly to each other, but that's it... and now I'm struggling to figure out if I should bring it up with her. I feel like *someone* should make sure she knows TikTok is doing this... but at the same time, it's none of my fucking business, and I don't want her to feel like I'm intruding on her private life.If I *do* bring it up with her, the conversation is going to be painful and uncomfortable for both of us... but it feels like a *bitch* move to let her continue to be oblivious to it. I mean... how many other people has TikTok suggested this account to? Literally *anyone* with her phone number and a TikTok account could easily stumble across this.Oh, and on top of all of this, Molly put in her two weeks recently. She found a job in the field she went to college for, so in two weeks, she's gone, and now it feels like there's a fucking *time limit* on figuring out what I'm gonna do! So... thoughts?

As she got older she became more obsessed with how people view her - and she would act completely different with other people versus her family, which can be normal i guess but it was weird to me how she would be so nice and caring and break down when people thought she wasn't nice, and then be so brutal and uncaring to her family. Granted- her parents were not super loving and didn't provide what she needed , but even to her siblings who were on the same boat as her she was rude. This continued to grow and she is now almost 20 and is so insanely private it's like no one knows who she is, she is different from person to person almost putting out exactly what she thinks will make that person like her more. Her image of herself  is so curated- she only wears one color and almost acts like a caricature of a person. She is very unwilling to talk about things beyond media she likes and she doesn't like any kind of teasing no matter how lighthearted.  She is extremely fixated on being the sweet girl character while she categorizes her boyfriend as the strong boy character and her relationship has to be perfect to outside viewers. The thing that concerns me the most is how she seems incapable of being truly vulnerable with people and she seems manipulative when she is- only sharing details that will make her look a certain way and then going behind peoples backs and being very different and more mean and it's almost distributing to the the difference between the image she projects to other people versus the cracks we see when she's with us and doesn't bother to try to project an image as much. She puts out like she is so incredibly loving and incapable of getting mad, while with her family she is the opposite and seems to resent us for knowing more than what she wants people to see. We recently found out some disturbing stuff about her and her boyfriend who she's had for a few years. Concerning like In the way she views herself and sex and the way he is treating her. We want to help her but we don't know how to talk about it because we know she will probably just walk away and nothing we say will get through to her truly.

I’ve constantly told her to stop and to leave me alone and would’ve removed her but I’m scared to remove her as when we had last talked without arguing she admitted feeling suicidal.I finally snapped and told her to either talk to me about the argument or to leave me alone for good to which she revealed one of her family members is dying and she’s not in a good place and asked for space before we spoke about that argument.I told her I’m sorry for what she’s going through and I expected the snaps to stop. But nope, still constant daily snaps. I just want her to leave me alone but I am worried about her especially during this time and feel like an asshole asking her to stop snapping me. I don’t mind if she needs someone to talk to but I need space from her after everything.Any advice to gently go low contact with her.",""
"511","I don’t like my partners best friend and I don’t like hearing about them. Any advice?","My partners best friend is someone he really gets on with and feels like he can talk to and I have appreciated when he’s been there to make him feel heard. Having said that whenever I used to see his best friend when we’d go to his or when he was there with his friends he’d always ask me intrusive questions. When I say this he would always say some story about how his friend was in a toxic relationship and they stop their partner spending money or seeing friends. He’d then always ask me questions like do you do that? What do you think about your partners spending habits? I always felt like I had to explain myself to him even though I don’t control my partner.He would then always ask me why did your partner go to see me? When did he get back? When did he go? He’d always ask me these three questions out of earshot of my partner I always answers as I felt intimidated. This got to a point where I couldn’t take it anymore I felt like he thought I was controlling my partner even though I wasn’t. I don’t force him to be in a relationship with me or come and see me. The constantly asking why made me feel as if it was unfathomable that someone would want to see me and spend time with me. I felt so low about myself like I was this evil person who was forcing my partner to see me. I told my partner and his friend said it was a joke. I then said it’s not a joke it makes me feel rubbish. I then asked my partner to tell his friend from me to stop asking me because it made me feel uncomfortable. I asked as my partner said he’d talk to him but it felt like he wasn’t making it a priority. His friend said that he was sorry and that was it.Now my partner keeps singing his praises and talking about him and it’s really upsetting me. What do I do? This is his best friend but it makes me uncomfortable. Any advice?

"512","Is it normal to feel slightly aggressive when drinking alcohol?","Hi, I do not drink often, but when I drink (one or two beers) I immediately get a confidence boost. Also I do feel more aggressive and would love to step over certain boundaries, however I do not because of the possible repercussions. Is that something that has to do with getting used to alcohol and would reduce when I would drink more regularly? Generally I do not like drinking because there is really no point in it other than being socially required, nevertheless I enjoy the increased confidence.",""

"514","Super Stressed: The situation is out of my hands","I have a new job, and I start on April 3rd. It is a really good job, and I'll make enough money to buy a car after my first check. But right now, I will use my best friend's boyfriend's truck. Well, she broke up with him about 2 days ago. I reached out to her and asked her about the insurance and tags because he said that's all I needed to pay in order to use the truck. He no longer uses the truck because he bought a new one a few years ago. He said I can use it for the first 2-3 months. Well, I messaged her about the truck because I need to go out of town for my first week of work, and I will need it immediately upon return to start my second week. She said she broke up with him and that it's up to him. They live together and have a child together, their break up has been a long time coming. He's really good to her, but she is going through a crisis and wants out to explore herself as a single woman. I don't want to get too much into it. But I messaged him about the truck, and he did not respond to me about it. I don't want to blow him up. I see that he has been active on social media, and I just don't know what to do. He is a good guy, and I don't think he is the type to rescind his offer. But this will really fuck me if he does. I have no money and no way to get to work without his help. I was so thankful for it. He offered it to me because I have watched their daughter many times so they can work, go out on dates, out of town, etc. And I am also a good friend to both of them. But anyway, I am hurt that he hasn't responded to me. I am not so cold that I don't understand that he is going through a lot. But it does suck that he has not responded. I don't know what to do about this situation, and I am truly stressed. If he does not help me, I am fucked. And this isn't just a regular job. It's a career. I just graduated with my bachelor's with honors in December. So this is the first job I have had in about 2 years, and I am so thankful I was able to get one so soon. He made this promise to me back in early February when I was offered the job. Now Idk what to do. I want to message him again, but I don't want to upset him more than he already is. My best friend asked if he ever responded to my inquiry about still borrowing the truck, and I told her that he hasn't. I told her that I would call him next week. She said ok because he is pretty upset about the breakup. I am so fucking stressed out right now. Idk what to do. I just need to know if he is going to allow me to use it or not. That's all I am really asking of him.",""
"515","Should I (16f) tell my ex-girlfriend (16f) I still have feelings for her?","I am Jane (16f) and the other person this post concerns is Katie (16f) . We live an hour apart. We met back on June 16th 2021, we were at a state meet for a sport we both play, I thought she was really cute so I went up to start a conversation with her. I got her snap, but she really did not seem interested in me; I figured maybe she's just not gay. Several months pass and I see her again in January 2022 at another big meet. she got silver and was so disappointed, I spent the remainder of the meet following her around in complete awe of her. like how would someone be this talented and not even see it! I saw her again at a state meet in February and I was the only person on the floor for her. I was cheering her on after and hyping her up for the next. After this we started snapping just a little bit. just back and forth silly selfies. I (at the time 15) got into a relationship with someone (m18) who was ab\*sive in march. He didn't want us to talk so he blocked her on my phone. After I ended things with him Katie and I started snapping again. She says she started to catch feelings for me in May 2022. In June we would call every night and pull all nighters to talk to each other. I told her how I felt right before I went away to work at a stay away summer camp. She said she felt the same way. my first night there by myself she stayed on the phone until I fell asleep because I was upset and really afraid. After a few days calls got shorter, we didn't talk for the rest of the summer. I was SA over the summer and was really just trying to keep it together. In October we started talking again. We started dating October 16th, 2022. 16 months from the very first day we met. We broke up on December 2nd. Honestly I don't know why I just got overwhelmed and convinced myself she hated me. She said i love you for the first time. This was huge because she has a really hard time expressing difficult emotions to me. This was also the first time I ever saw her cry. We dated for a bit then my dad got really sick and was hospitalized. She had no idea how to handle this. She copes with things that upset her by making jokes, and boy she is the funniest person I've ever met. She loves to make me laugh so I understand why she did what she did. She tried to make a few jokes about my father to try to brighten my mood, but holy shit I was livid. We broke up December 11th, 2022. Seeing her cry genuinely broke my heart, but I had to focus on my dad and she didn’t know how to support me. on NYE she was trying to plan to ask me out again but I told her no before she even got here. I didn't talk to her for a while. I was my father's primary care giver when he got home from the hospital so I kinda ghosted everyone. After he got better I started talking to her again. In mid February she texted me asking if we could talk, I said what was wrong. and she told me she's asexual. I was a little shocked but I told her it's ok. she said she ""wanted to tell me, so I didn't waste anymore of my time."" She has never been a waste of time and I love her more than words could explain. Seeing her smile is like seeing the stars for the first time, every time. we kept calling, facetiming, texting, snapping until we were here. I get my license this April right after her 17th birthday so we would finally be able to see each other more often. it feels like I got her back, the girl I fell in love with. She's so beautiful in every way I could mean that, but I don't know if with everything that's gone on, she would even want to deal with this again. TLDR: my ex-girlfriend and I met in June 2021, we started talking in February 2022. After a while I told her I had feelings for her in June, before going to work at a summer camp. We started dating in October, but broke up in December because she made light-hearted jokes about my dad while he was in the hospital. After we started speaking again she told me she was asexual. I'm not sure if I should tell her I have feelings for her after all this time and trouble.",""
"516","Should I just ditch everyone and hang out on my own?","So last night I was invited over to friend’s house. My other  friend and I haven’t been over to see them in like 2 months. Where as before it was usually once or twice a month and at some point 3 or 4 times a week. This has caused issues hurt feeling etc but the main reason is because the guy who invites us over only does it at like 9 at night when he’s wasted. Usually by that time we already have plans or have decided to stay in for the night. I also work a 9-5. Anyway last night my other friend who I live with was working late and I was trying to get a hold of him to ask if he wanted to go to their house. I said I was feeling up to it even though it was night but it was Friday night so I was off the next day. A whole group chat message exchange happened within that hour where the guy who invited us said he was tired and decided not to. I had already gotten ready and had just locked the door to my house to go over. Glad it was before I was on my way. So then my friend got off work finally and said he wanted to go but they already cancelled so to speak. So this afternoon Saturday.  I had plans to hang out with my best friend who I live with .He said we were hanging out this Saturday. So the other two guys who had invited us to the house last night texted both of us to hang out today. So I text my best friend and he tells me that he is actually out of town partying but will be back at 7. Like I believe that. So now they are asking me to hang out with them. I am very fed up with people making plans and cancelling them or making me feel expendable . I am very tempted to just Uber somewhere alone and drink.

He basically treats me like a FWB despite calling me his GF and introducing me to friends and family. It's possible we are just mismatched. Mutual friends were surprised when we got together. One litreally said ""but you're so warm and he's so independent....I never saw it coming"". He never wants to soend time with me. He rarely brings me on dates as simple as a walk or coffee or the cinema. Yesterday we were both off work and college and he spent the whole day with a new female friend and I started crying after a few drinks over it. He then said I was controlling and not letting him have female friends, when the reality is idgaf. I just assumed we would hang together as he said we would a few days prior AND they went to the cinema together the night before AND they went for coffee, to a bar and then the cinema on our day off.

"520","Asking for help/suggestions plz","I come from a family of 7 my mother and my brothers and sister, but unfortunately i am the youngest of all of them. Everyone's ages are late 30-mid 40's while i sit at the age of 20 my family. we get along together well, but we have a sort of disconnect since they are at a different point in life. I try my best to converse w them, but in the end its still a little awkward. Now to get to the point, my mother owns 2 houses and doesnt have much income since she is retired, so i try to help her the best that i can when it comes to money since out of all of my brothers only one is willing to give her money when she needs it. Most of the my family is really stingy when money comes into play seeing as that we had nothing growing up. she owns 2 house one in the united states and one in Mexico. she goes back and forth alot throughout the year since both are her beloved homes. recently in the past few years after i be came a adult the house in Mexico has been needing repairs at first I was okay with her a couple of hundred dollars to help but in the past year she asked us to give her a grand each by November to have the home exterior repaired. Now almost 4 months later shes asking us if we can send another grand. i was reluctant the first time, but gave it to her anyway even though i never go and never really want to go since there is nothing in Mexico that would make me what to visit. My brothers and sister go there bc to them its a vacation home. I work day in and day out and cover most of the bills in the house my mother and I live in the states and pay for most of her needs like medication food and sometimes even clothes if she wants something, but says its to expensive, while still leave some money aside for me to save. I don't make a lot I make roughly 30k a year w side jobs and work that i pick up with my friends dad. On the other hand everyone else makes roughly 60k-120k and they also have partners and have there own homes and own problems. When it comes down to our home in Mexico though its everyone's problem I mean a grand my brothers and sister is not much, but to me that's a lot for me to give again in such a short span. My siblings also want to throw her a final birthday one she would remember till she passes because she's nearing a very old age. To be precise shes 69 now and is starting to struggle w day to day tasks like walking long distances and lifting and her health conditions are gradually getting worse as years come. I really can't afford 2 give another grand to my mother for the new repairs for the house, and definitely not  another grand that my brothers and sister are going to ask me in the coming months before my mothers next birthday. I mean i need to get a new car snice the one I have is close to taking a shit and I want to peruse higher education and go back to school and attend college within the next few years. At this point I'm lost and losing motivation everyday and idk what to do. I wasn't able to go do things I want to do since  near the end of last year bc that was the money I had saved for my vacation I was going to take and hang out w my online friends and have a good time and the money leftover was going back into my savings. and now seeing that my brothers and sister are asking me for another grand and to expect me to cough up another when her birthday comes around this summer I'm really looking for advice on what to do because at this point I just want to pack my stuff up and leave without a trace for them to find me so I can try to enjoy my life and do the things I want to do.",""

She is my friend, and some months ago, seemed interested in me by texting me everyday. At this point I confronted her about her feelings and said she really didn’t see me more than a friend. I moved on and cleared the situation with her but we still texted everyday all day long. Until one day she jumped on me and kissed me like 15 min straight. She said she enjoyed it but not to try getting sentimentally involved because she has a boyfriend already. At this point she almost stopped texting me because “it looked like a relationship and that was weird weird”. Months later, I have seen her again. We didn’t have an intercorse but kissed for at least 1 hour I think. Next day she said, again,she doesn’t have feelings for me. And sent me a lingerie pic.

I would love to be a creative, I love analysing all pieces of media I intake and thinking about how I would do something if I was in the creatives shoes. Especially film, there’s something so mesmerising about the idea of working on a set with people just as enthused as I am about creating something for others. 1000% in the screenwriting department, I’ve always loved writing.I’ve also thought about game design, for a lot of the same reasons but creating something interactive has a whole different charm to it. My logic however keeps repeating the same things to me though, that creative careers are very dependent on luck. The idea of taking a ‘leap of faith’ is mortifying. I don’t want to jump into a life decision without having any bearing on the outcome. I don’t want to be someone who tried and failed, having something I’m passionate about be just seen as a silly hobby that didn’t work out. My grades in school pretty much allow me to get any degree I want at uni so I could slot into something that pays well- but I despise the idea of my profession being something I don’t enjoy. I know that ‘it’s normal to dislike your job’ but I don’t want to live like that, especially since I’ve been given the opportunities I have. But it would be the easy choice.There’s things I enjoy that don’t involve creativity either- I’m good with computers and enjoy learning more about the machines so I could do something that works with either the software or hardware of PC’s. I also just enjoy learning in general, I’ve always been weirdly curious about degrees in marine biology, sexual health and gender studies. I could become some type of academic? I could go into more detail but I’ll spare everyone the time. I just don’t know what to do with myself.",""

"534","steps to take to stop prioritizing external validation?","hello!i have a specific set of circumstances that have left me sort of isolated from many ""normal"" developmental experiences and milestones for teenagers/young adults - i was homeschooled my whole life through high school and i am very likely on the autism spectrum - and while i am genuinely happy with my life there's always been this crazy overwhelming feeling that i've been missing something big. i am a 21yr old virgin and have never been in any substantial romantic relationships, and while i am logically aware of the fact that i do not need a partner/romance to lead a fulfilling life, the feeling that there’s something wrong with me due to the fact that nobody has ever shown interest in dating me has only strengthened with time. it doesn’t help that i’m not conventionally attractive (i’m plus-sized and have a genetic skin disorder that lots of people consider horrific lol) and i am in online college so i don’t even interact with many people i don’t already know. it sounds really stupid to write out - i don’t want to believe that my worth as a human is defined by men’s interest in me, but it’s so deeply ingrained that i can’t really try to function outside of it?i know it’s not uncommon for people, especially autistic and fat women to start dating in their twenties. being surrounded by people who went to public high schools and universities and had all these normal experiences just really makes the isolation feel worse, though. i’m lucky to have loved ones who support me, and don’t even seem to recognize how lonely i’ve felt - so i know it’s not as big of a deal as it feels to me.TL;DR, i’ve never felt “wanted” and it bothers me very much. are there concrete steps i could be taking in order to overcome this obsession with external validation?",""

I spend the night at his apartment or he spends the night at my house about 3/4 days of the week + i get lunch with him every MWF and i don’t feel like i’m codependent on him at all or that he is codependent on me, we just genuinely enjoy eachothers company. My roommates think it’s a problem though. One of them is constantly making passive aggressive jokes about never seeing me anymore even though i’m always hanging out with her if we are both in the house which happens everyday and every time I don’t spend the night with my boyfriend, we hang out and watch a movie or something until we go to bed. She says they both think I like them less because I see them less often and I just don’t see it that way at all and I know she’s starting to resent me. We’ve had many heart to hearts about it but we never see eye to eye, she expects me to change how often i see him and that’s just not something i can promise. She thinks in our 20s we are supposed to prioritize our friendships over romantic relationships because we can have fun without marriage getting in the way and driving us apart. I think she’s being pretty cynical. I don’t know what to do without sacrificing the time i enjoy spending with my boyfriend. she also questions wether or not i’m going to resign our lease because she thinks i’m going to decide to move in with my boyfriend even though that’s not even something i would even consider right now and she knows he just signed a lease with his two roommates for a house next semester. she’s even gone as far as to writing down how often we spend the night together so she can bring it up to me the next time we talk about it. what do i do.tl;dr: my roommate thinks i spend too much time with my boyfriend and is starting to resent me for it",""
"536","I think I hate my sister.","Okay so I know this sounds dramatic, and I know that our ages probably make it seem unreasonable because we haven’t “lived to the fullest” or whatever, but idk, it feels just. So much if that makes sense?My sister (16f) and I (18f) have never ever gotten along, my parents (39f and 43m) can attest to that. We’ve maybe had a total of 6 moments where we weren’t fighting each other that I can remember. I think part of it has to do with the way we were raised as well. I’m the oldest so I always had all the responsibilities. Even when we adopted my brother (12m) I took care of him maybe 40% of the time and my parents 60% of the time. But my sister, I’ll call her Skylar for the sake of the story, never ever had any responsibilities growing up. If she did, she would cry and complain until my parents were fed up and did it for her. She got away with everything. I know it’s not her fault but I think I’ve come to resent her for it. Some of the things that I can think of off the top of my head:- I payed for all of my own devices, and even some of hers, through hard earned money or birthday money. She’s never had to pay for her own anything- I’m responsible for my younger brother, and most of the chores, half the time, and she sits in her room unhelpful- She refuses to do anything that doesn’t benefit herself- Everything I have ever lent her (headphones, laptop, a very special and personal backpack, etc) has either gotten lost or broken in her care, and when I confront her about it she laughs- Has called me mean and degrading names, past the usual sibling rivalry stuff (stuff like criticizing my outfits or projects that I’m proud of, degrading things I’m excited about, calling me names or my friends names, etc)- Physically attacks me if I do something she doesn’t like and doesn’t stop even when I ask her to (to the point where my parents will tell her to stop because she’s gone too far)- Is not supportive of anyone but herself, and never has any consequences to it- Genuinely is just the most inconsiderate and rude person I’ve ever met- Has told me throughout my whole childhood that she hates me and when I tell my parents they just brush it offThere’s probably more stuff I could think of, or more specific things if I tried but I don’t have the energy right now. She doesn’t get any consequences to her actions past maybe getting her phone taken away for a day or two (but still being able to use MY laptop for her free time) and getting scolded. But most the time she just laughs. I don’t know if I’m just being overdramatic and sensitive, or if this is just teenager shit and she’ll grow out of it, but as of right now I think I hate her and I feel really guilty about it because I should love her. I try to be there for her when she needs me, but I just get shut down and yelled at by her so I don’t even really try anymore except for out of guilt. I think I hate her as a person. Is that bad? What do I do about it? Do I cut her off or just live with it because she’s my sister? I’m really at a loss because I already am like 90% certain I want to cut off my parents but I also don’t want to lose my family, you know? Idk, this is long so I’ll wrap it up. But ya, moral of the story, my sister is a terrible person and I think I hate her and have no idea what to do about it. Please help.",""
"537","Should I (20M) break up with my boyfriend (25M) of two and a half years, or should I accept his faults and settle?","So I’ve been dating by current (and first) boyfriend for two and a half years, we started dating over the pandemic and have been long-ish distance ever since (we see each other once a week and live an hour-ish away from one another.) When we first met, he was this mature-ish guy who treated me kindly and didn’t objectify me, so we got really close really fast, and we both went through some wild things. Like, we aren’t out to either of our families for safety reasons, two months into dating he quit his job, quit the next one, went to night school, and about a year into dating he found out he had a tumor on his brain stem, so the last year or so has been devoted to being there for him and his recovery after his surgery. But he’s fully recovered now, and some parts of our relationship has been troubling me, and it’s like I’m just now seeing them, so I want to see if I’m overreacting or not. Going way back to when we first started dating, it took him over a year to call me. He claimed he had phone anxiety, and it wasn’t about me, but it really hurt that I could only see him once a week and couldn’t hear his voice any other time. From the get-go, he’s always been more sexual than me, in fact for our one month anniversary he gave me a fishnet thong (I got him candy and a gift card). But that often meant that our dates were just us going back to my apartment and having sex, then he would fall asleep on top of me until it was time for him to go. If it matters, the sexy was good for the first six months or so, but since then, I can count the amount of times I’ve finished with him on one hand. One of the biggest hurdles is that he simply doesn’t clean. Ever since he moved into his current place in Fall of 2021, he hasn’t cleaned his room once and has cleaned his bathroom only twice. His floor is covered in clothes and trash, and he never puts his clothes away, he just grabs a handful of clothes from the floor every few days to wash them. In fact, over the summer I stepped on a plastic tape dispenser and it shattered under my foot (OUCH). His bathroom floor is still covered in cornstarch that he spilled in May, the toilet bowl is stained brown, and for a period of a few weeks he ran out of toilet paper and just never went to buy any. His car is no different either, trash is piled to the ceiling. The car came to a T over the summer when he, his roommate and I were heading off on a mini-vacation. And he asked me to drive last minute even though he had planned to because he had “car trouble.” The morning of our trip I was taking his roommates garbage cans to the curb when I saw that his car was still piled to the ceiling in trash. On the way to our destination, his roommate asked if he ever got around to cleaning his car, and he smiled and said he had already cleaned it all out… which made me blood boil.His refusal to clean has reached the point where I gave him an ultimatum, “I won’t go to your house until you clean it, if you want to see me, you have to come to my town”. and so far he’s come to my town every week for three months, he hasn’t cleaned, and pulls into my apt building with trash piled up to his ceiling. He’s almost at peace with not having me come over so he doesn’t have to clean.With the biggest hurdle out of the way, I’ve also discovered that he may a bit too mean-spirited for me. To give a little context, I work in theatre professionally, and am about to finish up my degree in it. He occasionally does community theatre, and constantly hangs it over me like a knife: “I’ve done more shows than you” “I’ve done more musicals than you” I have more professional experience than you” … he doesn’t… to all of them, but I didn’t want to be mean and join the dick-measuring contest. The biggest example of this is when I told him about my future dream. For years (before I met him) I’ve always want to start a professional theatre that serves areas where arts education is underfunded/cut altogether. I’m perfectly content if it never happens, it’s just been my go-to daydream for years. When I told him about it, he set me down with a whiteboard and listed out every way it would fail if I started it, to the point that I was in tears. He then did a total 180, and has since taken over the dream, and calling it “our” theatre company, casting himself in roles and completely steamrolling everything I had planned. But his snobbery when it comes to theatre really hits hard when he talks about other people, like he saw me in a musical a year ago, and he kept complaining that our dancers heels weren’t high enough. When I told him it was because they were doing lifts that could be dangerous in higher heels he simply told me “beauty is pain.” This came to a T recently when he asked me out on a “date” to go watch a local high school production to “make fun of how bad it is.” Outside of theatre, he talks about violence a lot more than I’m comfortable with. He’s never threatened any sort of violence against me; but when other people annoy him, his first response is to say things like “let’s cut his break lines” “I want to kill that man” etc. It’s getting a hair concerning. Commitment is another thing I should mention. From the beginning I’ve told him that I don’t want to get married for a long, long time, I want to explore the world and become my true self before I make a commitment like that. But he constantly talks about how many kids we’ll have, and he’s looking for houses online, and is clearly ready to settle down. It’s something every guy should want, but for some reason it’s making me a little uneasy. Now that the negatives are mostly out of the way, why should I stay with him? Well, for one, I really care about him. I don’t want to ever hurt him or see him sad, I’ve seen him get to some horribly low places, and I don’t want it to happen again. He’s also genuinely in love with me, and my biggest cheerleader for my career. He wants to see me succeed, and is willing to spend months apart at a time if I need to go off somewhere for a job, that’s not something to just throw away. On a sadder note, he’s on the Autism spectrum, and has fibromyalgia, along with his recent brain surgery. He’s been through a lot, and I feel like the worst person in the world for even thinking about leaving him after all we’ve been through. I genuinely love him, but I don’t know how much good that love will do if our sex life is non-existent and the romance seems to be drying up?   TL/DR: Longterm boyfriend doesn’t clean and is rude to others, but genuinely cares about me and loves me.",""

"539","Losing hope on finding real love","I (Male, 23) have basically given up on trying to finding true love. I’m a relationship type of guy who’s had one serious relationship for 3 and a half years. That relationship ended almost 2 years ago and since then it’s been rough. She left me and found someone else a month later and it destroyed me. I’ve been good since and it doesn’t affect me anymore but what affects me is feeling so lonely. I’m a family guy, I don’t really have a big social circle I have a few real friends who I hang out with, I don’t go out much and I work a lot. Dating apps don’t work, I barely go out and my hobbies (hockey, football, workout at home) don’t involve girls. Since the breakup I haven’t been on any dates or even get close to a date. I’ve been through a lot of shit and I’m a good person who puts others before myself & does alot of good things but I don’t seem to get any respect back. Seems like nothing ever goes my way. I’ve set ppl up in the past with girlfriends but nobody ever did me a favor and introduced to me a girl. I work hard for my money (construction) and on weekends I wish I can go do something to talk to girls but there’s never opportunity. Bars and clubs seem to be options but I have nobody that ever wants to go because 2 of my main friends have girlfriends and the other few don’t like going out and going out by myself is weird. I have friends right now who cheat on their girlfriends all the time (I told them I don’t like that and warned them many times it’s not cool but they never listened). It hurts me cause I was so loyal in my last relationship and got fucked over yet people out there treat girls like shit and still have a relationship. I’m a very loyal guy who wants real love and doesn’t do hookups but I have no clue what to do anymore. Seems like ppl now in days don’t want anything serious. I want another girlfriend but I barely  get opportunities and when I do it goes nowhere. Seems like the most blessed and nice ppl in this world get fucked over the most it’s so sad it’s had me mentally drained and helpless. I can handle being alone I just can’t stand the feeling of being lonely. I barely see girls, been to one bar once  in the last 8 months and currently not speaking to any girls.

"541","My friend has a unhealthy K-Pop addiction, that he spends all his money on and has lost a few friends over. What should I do?","You’re probably thinking either 2 things, “Yeah K-Pop is weird” or “who cares what music he listens to”. But this has became a genuine problem that’s affecting his life for the worst. He’s a good friend but this K-Pop stuff has made me question if I should even keep being friends with him. But first some backstory, let me tell you, stranger on the internet, where it all went wrong. So this story has 3 main characters, My K-pop addicted friend (Who I’m gonna call A) My best friend (Who I’m gonna call Ike) and Me. It all started around 2020 when Ike, A and I became good friends through playing games together during the pandemic, I knew A but we weren’t really friends until then. Sometime later, Ike is talking to this one girl that he has a crush on, she likes K-Pop so Ike decides to also listen to K-Pop to connect with her. At this point I didn’t really care until one day when Ike tells me he’s gonna get A into K-Pop as a joke. I’m thinking one friend who likes K-Pop is bad enough but whatever, it’s probably not gonna become anything. I was wrong cause it only took 2 hours and A was into it now, but in a different way than Ike was. A made it his whole personality basically. That’s when it starts to get annoying since while Ike didn’t push it on to me, A pushed it on to EVERYONE. He forced all his friends to listen to it and got mad when they declined. He kept playing the music even when we asked him to stop, he posted and talked about K-Pop online, and in school. He started spending all his money on K-Pop albums and photo cards. He had a hobby collecting Lego sets and he had nice collection, but he started thinking of selling a expensive prized Lego Mini-figure for K-Pop. All his other friends got really annoyed at it really quickly and when they told him they didn’t like him obsessing over it, A said he cared about K-Pop more than them and cut them off. He has lost at least 3 friends due to this. He was working 2 jobs over the summer making $150+ a week just to spend all of it on K-Pop. Me and Ike asked him to save up money to buy a nice gaming laptop so he doesn’t have to play on his crappy old Xbox One but he said he needed all the money for K-Pop. At one point he started donating insane amounts of money to Asian TikTok streamers for no reason other than they were Asian including stealing 100 dollars from his mom to do so. So I decided I would give him a taste of his own medicine, so I started ironically obsessing over Family Guy. Anything he did with K-Pop I did with Family Guy, I got a Brian Griffin Discord pfp to match his Nayeon one, I sent Family Guy memes to him like he sent K-Pop memes to me, I made everyone watch family guy when we went to his house like he forced all of us to listen to k-pop. And of course all I talked about was Family Guy. At first it seemed he didn’t care until one day he snapped and told me I’m annoying for making my entire personality Family Guy and forcing it onto people. I pointed out the hypocrisy but he denied it saying I was worse. We didn’t talk for a few weeks until my friends said A kept annoying them by complaining about me so much and we need to make up. Reluctantly I started talking to him again. But this is my final straw, I don’t know what to do, Ike and other friends don’t know either. Does he need help, or should I just stop taking to him.",""
"542","My bf lied to me about something small and now I’m questioning everything","Me (26f) and my bf (28m) have been together almost 2 years.

I think it’s a natural human thing to a certain degree.The other day, we had a storage container in our yard that a couple things were stolen from. I was upset. I remember he was in there the night prior, and I saw the lock in the garage. I asked him after we noticed things were missing if he had locked it that night, and he said yes. But how would have anyone gotten in? Also, I saw the lock in the garage. So I told him I didn’t think he did, and he admitted he didn’t. I said he told me he locked it so when I report the stolen info in the claim it sounds more concrete.I’m just so bothered he lied. Why not be open about it. I told him how much that bothered me and he initially went on to ask if I had ever told him a lie? Like he is saying it’s okay if it’s harmless at times.Have I ever lied to me bf? I’ve told him I’ve worked out at home on a day I didn’t, because I was feeling lazy. That’s it. So I don’t know.Anyways, I’m wondering how big of a red flag this is.

They have maybe 1-2 good days a month where they’re super happy and outgoing but most of the time they’re in their room and don’t talk to my mother or our other sibling. They have expressed that they’re depressed, have nothing to live for and feel hopeless. My mother and I have suggested on many occasions they get help but they refuse it. They also get angry quite easily if we say the wrong thing. Their friends have visited and tried to hold an intervention with no success.  I am ready to do research and pay for therapy, psychiatry, anything but they are not interested at all. This is making my mother depressed too so every time I visit my family home I’m having to cheer my mother up. I hate seeing her blame herself for my siblings mental health. I don’t know what to do. I struggle to understand my sister sometimes. I’m also really hurt by my dads behavior and suffer from depression but I’ve always got help for it. I don’t know why they have given up on themselves. I want them to fight for their happiness but I don’t know how. I love them so much and I don’t want them to be depressed for the rest of their lives. Any advice would be appreciated",""
"550","Toxic Copycat “Friend”","so i am an artist. i met this person in college, he soon started to show signs of jealousy and envy towards me. sabotaging me, saying disrespectful remarks towards me, even stealing my ideas to play them off like his own. basically he started trying to mimic my entire personality, & hobbies, all the way down to my career (music). all while trying to be just like me, and trying to one up me at the same time. i had told him he does not give me enough credit, but i truly think he is blind to the fact of how terrible this is. he even once said being an artist is about stealing everyone elses ideas you like and making them your own. i want to completely cut this person off but they have made their way into my industry, exactly where i want to work & with the people i want to work with. he is highly manipulative and i just don’t know what to do or how to go about it. keep in mind this person poses as my “best friend” and i even used to live with them for over a year. please help. any advice is appreciated. i am now trying to separate myself, i no longer live with him. i try to go as little contact as possible but the thought of him is constantly irritating me and i am always feeling frustrated and disrespected and can’t seem to get over it or let this go. thanks for listening.",""

I started hearing sounds and knew there was no child but I still ran away. The most recent one I was sitting down on a rock next to the tracks and thought I saw a man in boots in front of me as I stood up then he instantly vanished.

"553","Wondering why some people pick on my “shyness” so much? It feels rude","I’m 22f. Last night, I went out with a cousin of mine (22f) that is visiting from another country. She invited me along to meet a group of people at a bar. She only knew one of these guys (34M). That guy happened to bring one of his guy friends, and that guy friend brought along a married couple, along with another woman and her daughter. All these people, except my cousin and I, were in their mid/late 30’s. I didn’t know anyone there but I had agreed to go because tbh I like going out a lot in social settings. (However, I thought that this outing was gonna be with people my age).Anyways, when my cousin and I got there, we said hi to everyone and sat down. I start looking around and making small conversation with the people around me. I then started feeling a little weird bc I didn’t know any of them, and also I had just met my cousin less than a week ago, so I don’t know her that well either. She was talking with me, but mostly she seemed to be in deep conversation with the guy that she knows. Not even 5-10 mins after I got there, he says to me “ You seem a little closed off, why aren’t you talking rn?” I was like “ it’s just that I don’t know you guys that’s why” (even tho I actually was making small convo with the other ppl around me). However, he then continued to insist, he was like “Normally girls from here are more open, you see I didn’t even know this woman here before today but now I get along with her, you seem too closed off and shy”. This is when I lost it and said “How could you assume that about me without knowing me? Also, you’ve been here for hours before I got here, you had time to talk to these ppl & get to know them. I just got here 10 minutes ago and you’re already making assumptions about me”. He then just got quiet and said “oh well yeah true”. I felt so insulted, bc no one there knew me enough to say something like that. Even my cousin has known me less than a week. I’m usually an outgoing person, I love going out with my friends a lot. They wouldn’t ever describe me as “shy”. I’m the complete opposite tbh. I also love meeting new people (this is the reason I went in the first place but also bc I thought most of them would be around my age or still in their 20’s at least). My cousin at least knew that guy she’s been friends with him for a while, but I didn’t know anyone. Ofc I talked way more throughout the night once I got more comfortable, but I don’t understand why make a big deal about my supposed “shyness” in the first 10 mins that I got there? It was really rude to me  because it made me uncomfortable.",""

"555","My neighbor is driving me crazy and I am at a loss of what to do.","Currently, I am listening to my neighbors rattle my wall with their stupid speakers. I went on legal advice to see what I could do. Someone suggested I get a decibel counter app on my phone. I did but I’m not getting any useful numbers (80dB for 8 hours). It only comes to be about 50 but I know it’s way more then that. I know so much about them that would get them thrown in prison if I had any conclusive evidence, but I don’t and that’s where I feel stuck. This has been going on since the lockdown in PA and I am at my wits end. I think I finally know why people murder their neighbors. I don’t necessarily want them dead, but I do want justice in a way. My mental health has rapidly declined in the past three years and I’ve noticed how short my temper is. Any small footsteps causes them to turn them on. And I don’t mean quiet music that we can’t hear. It has gotten to the point where it’s shakes things off the shelves and walls in my house.My landlord (we have the same landlord) won’t do anything about it since he couldn’t care less. The police can’t do anything about it. The only other option I can see is to go nuclear. I can post a video of just a small taste of what I’ve had to deal with for the past 3 years. It’s not just the noise honestly, they also just don’t watch their kids. The boyfriend and girlfriend (important detail that they aren’t married. I don’t really care about not being married it’s the reason why that pisses me off) are always screaming at each other. They are both avid drug users. Unfortunately I have no concrete evidence but it’s plainly obvious. The reason I mention that that they aren’t married is because they are government scammers. They are on welfare and claim money through the state and whatnot. And since they aren’t married and have two kids, they both get to claim money for them. The girlfriend has a job but she gets paid under the table(i don’t know if that considered tax evasion because I’m not super well versed in the law) and I’m not exactly sure what he does. All I know is that somehow they can afford an expensive heroine habit and three cars. Not to mention the speakers that can be heard from a street over. I know not all people on welfare are scammers but I know people who actually need that money but because of people like my neighbor, they get denied. I’m tired of walking on eggshells in my own house. I’m tired of not being able to just be in my house without having to worry about every little sound in my house. I’m tired of my cats and dogs going insane over the noise and in turn, facing the backlash from my neighbors. I’m just tired but I want them to know that they shouldn’t have screwed with me. I’ve tried asking politely(far too many times in my opinion), getting the police and landlord involved and doing the normal pound on the wall or play loud music back (they had the balls to call ME childish over that). Does anybody have any advice on what action I should take? Has anyone ever had to deal with something like this? I feel so alone since I’m the only one willing to try and do anything about it.[these are the videos of the noise](https://imgur.com/a/XoccwX4)",""

"561","How to handle a roommate who thinks he knows the best?","I (24) and my roommate (23M) applied for the same job. I got in after all rounds but he didn't. He was fine. One day we were talking about something after a really bad day at work. I told him about how hard it was to keep up. And he just casually told me it's because I haven't struggled at all in my life. The difference between us is that he has done all household chores and I haven't done any. I come from an underprivileged brown family who struggled to find a foothold in society and thought that only way possible would be through a good education. They wouldn't let me do anything other than that and that took a toll on my mental health. On the other hand his family never cared about education and things like that. He has a few gap years. They are much better in the society and wealthier than us. He hasn't struggled a day in his life financially whereas my parents on the other hand struggled with my fees. Whenever he gets better grades than me he wouldn't stop talking about it for hours. But I never once ruined that for him because I know he likes when people look up to him. I worked really hard for this job and he tells me that straight to my face. I still don't go off. I just told him simply that no one does that work since they were toddlers, we all are just newbies in corp life and gotta learn while working. And he says ""Yeah! I can't even get my point across because you think that you shouldn't listen from someone who doesn't even do that."" And walked away. I just felt really bad and didn't say anything.

I have had pens thrown at me, yelled at walking in the hall, and just generally been subjected to mean conditions. Secondly, I hate how the school curriculum is structured. The grading scale is 1–7, and I can’t even begin to explain how much homework I have. I’m up until 2–3 a.m. most nights and my parents just say I need to manage my time better. Im constantly stressed and never have time to do stuff I like, like going to the gym, playing piano, etc. Thirdly, my dad completely interferes with my life and work. I am seen as the teacher’s kid. Additionally, he started working at the school where he wanted me to go just so he could oversee me. I have no freedom and I feel suffocated. Lastly, it’s just so small. There are 28 people in my whole grade, and I can’t make friends because everyone has already decided they don’t like me. All of them have been going to school with each other for years, (it’s a K-12 school), and they ganged up on me immediately from the first day.

"565","I'm 22m am just as bad if not worse than my ex 18f","I recently just ended our 4 month relationship. Things started going down hill already about three in a half into it. She all of a sudden got very distant, was avoiding me, caught her in a few lies, and such about two weeks. I would confront her and try to talk to her about it and she just wouldn't. We eventually had a phone call and decided to work things out she came over the next day we talked and decided to keep things going and try to get better. A week later I take her to a store to grab stuff for a resort we were going to and when I dropped her back off she forgot her phone in my car. After those two weeks of avoiding and lying and all i lost a lot of trust and couldn't stop myself form going through her phone. When I did I saw she was flirting with someone and slept with someone while during those two weeks. I went to her house and confronted her we both cried and she assured me she wanted to fix things very badly. So I put my feelings aside and let her come with my family and I to the resort. Later that night her and I went out to the car and had a very good two hour conversation about us and where we wanted things to go and all that. We go back to the room at night and we end up falling asleep. I wake up in the middle of the night and couldn't resist the temptations of going through her phone again. So I dug through it for hours and found that she was flirting with many many different guys, sending/receiving nudes, planning threesomes, planning on going out with other guys and did go out with other guy, she cheated on me our entire relationship there was not a day she didn't. After finding everything I found I woke her up at 6:30 in the morning took her outside the room and told her I couldn't do this anymore and took her home shortly after. I never once raised my voice, touched her, or even said anything foul to her after finding all this. I treated her like gold our entire relationship would get her lunch at her job as often as I could, spent as much time with her as I could, bought her gifts, hyped her up, compliments all the time, took her out, and just much more. She never once gave me any of that back in our relationship a lot of it was one sided. We did have lots of good times and I know she liked me a lot like a lot. She fought her whole family to be with me. She's just young and didn't understand what a relationship was or how it was supposed to be for I was her first for everything. I am a big hypocrite though. The entire time she was doing what she was doing I was too. I had a stockpile of videos/pictures, things I did with other girls, I was talking to other girls, would flirt, send/receive photos and videos. I just didn't get caught. The only thing I didn't do was sleep with another person while we were together. Which I know still terrible and doesn't make me any better than her. I say I may even be worse than her because I played victim. I made her feel bad about everything she did when I did it too. I know she feels terrible about what she did she would cry to the point she would throw up. I am the only person who knows about me doing most of what she did to her. My friends and family don't understand why I feel bad for her and sympathize for her but it's because I understand why she did the things she did. I just don't want to look like the bad guy when I 100% am. I know we are both in the wrong for what we did and maybe more me than her. I feel terrible about it and I just needed to get it off my chest. During those two weeks is when I realized I wanted her and only her and got rid over everything and everyone I Whats behind her back. I think she fully realized she wanted me and only me when I broke up with her for what she did. I didn't give her time to change and fix what she did because I was so hurt. I just don't know how I could be hurt when I did the same thing.Now I'm asking for advice. We haven't spoken in two weeks and I'm waiting for her to talk to me first. I'm torn in two. I want to take her back and give her another chance because I feel like me forgiving her and starting over is me forgiving myself as well, or take what I learned and forget about her and start over with someone else. I now fully know how shitty I am for what I did and I learned a lot from our relationship. I know now how much pain and misery doing that to someone can bring. I'm just hoping she learns and knows from it too. I just don't know what to do. I can't message her even if I wanted because I got rid of her on everything. I don't have her number but she has mine. That's why I'm waiting for her to make the first move. This has made me believe karma is a real thing and it always comes back around.

"569","How should I handle my sister who is essentially holding my cat hostage?","More than anything this is to vent, but if anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it.I apologize if this is a bit hard to follow, I am incredibly angry and not really thinking straight at the moment. I'll just start at the beginning. My cat is six years old, I got her when she was about five months old. Last fall, I unfortunately had to move into a place that doesn't allow cats, and my sister said she would care for her while I look for a new place. that was around five months ago. My sister and I live in different cities four hours away from each other, and with our living situations it's just easier if I drive down her visit her rather than her coming to me when we see each other. Back in October I found a new place that would allow me to have my cat again, so once I'd signed the lease and gotten everything in order I thanked her for taking care of the cat but she wouldn't need to do so starting this august, which is when I can move in to my new place. She insisted that because she watched my cat for a few months she is now entitled to keep her for the rest of her life (which would entail living with her roommate's pit bull that is known to be bad with cats). Starting in October I have tried probably three dozen times to sit down with her and have a conversation about why this is not the case, but any time I do she throws a tantrum and shuts me out. My future landlady has been pestering me for nearly three months about whether or not I'm bringing an animal, and I can't tell her anything until my sister and I come to an agreement, but we can't do that while she refuses to speak to me. My sister lives in our home town, and I had a week break so I decided to come and visit her and the rest of my family for a few days. when I got to my parents house where I was staying, my sister comes up to me and asks if I can take care of the cat while she goes to see a friend a state over for a few days. she is my cat, so of course I didn't mind. I am writing this from my sister's apartment, where my cat is currently living in awful conditions. Back in January (which was the last time I came down to visit) the vet put on on a diet of half wet food and half dry food. I went to the store that same day and bought the food the vet recommended and left it at the apartment for my sister. Now back to today, I enter the apartment and see the food I bought nearly two months ago still sitting where I left it, along with a stool sample kit my sister said she'd take care of and three months worth of flea/heart worm medication the cat supposed to be getting on the 1st each month, so now she's missed three doses.When I asked my sister how she was doing in the middle of February, She promptly lied to me, telling me that she was up to date on her meds, had the sample taken to the vet, and was loving her new wet food (which was still sitting unopened in the bag the pet store put it in months ago). My sister is off with her friends and won't get back until tomorrow night, at which point I will have already left to go back to my place. At first, she treated like a negotiation, haggling over how many times a year she's willing to send my cat back and forth to our respective apartments. And she doesn't understand why I won't subject het to that. She doesn't get why putting her in a new environment with new people and new smells once a month would be bad for her. And now she isn't answering my messages and she's blocked my number, saying she refuses to talk about this anymore because she won't give up my cat. I don't know what to do. (TW) for six years, my cat has been the reason I'm still here. She has been my anchor point in life and was all I had when I was at my worst. and the thought of her living with someone who can't even feed her what she needs for the rest of her life kills me. I have a key to her place, and It's gotten to the point that I'm considering just taking her back one day when she's out drinking with her friends like she always is. I can't do this anymore.",""

I have had chronic pain, chronic migraines, infertility, and mental health issues mostly starting after that accident.  My sister and I do not have a good relationship.  My sister is not a nice person and has kept her kids away from me because of family drama.  This has broken my heart.  Due to this I also have very bad relationships with my parents, they side with her.  They think I’m the problem and she’s the saint.

To say the least my parents are awful people, they are into drugs, they have too many animals and there is constant screaming and fighting. I’ve been back at this house for about a year now but it is very draining and I find myself loosing motivation to keep going. I am in school and working part time to try and get out of this cycle.I used to live with my grandmother, and she is the other option I have. The problem is, she is 85 and very feeble. The reason I left in the first place is because she took in my 7 year old cousin and basically put the responsibility on me. I was very unhappy.Now as I see it I could stay at my parents and just keep pushing through for as long as I can, or I can move back in with my grandmother and have to take care of a kid again. In both cases my sister is going to be with me. Living at my parents means putting up with neglect and living with my grandmother means taking on a lot more responsibility than I am prepared for.",""
"572","How do you deal with losing friends?","So lately i’ve been feeling very isolated. I used to have a big secure friend group but the past 2 years Ive been getting more and more distant from them. I went through a pretty rough patch, having an ED and being depressed. I also got into a relationship end of 2020 which led me to spend less quality time with my friends. i still see them kind of regularly (once a week or every 2 weeks) but the intimacy is just not there anymore. I see them posting stories without me regularly and having like at home friend nights but i’m only ever invited to parties or nights out and i only see like 2 friends privately just the two of us. One of them has been my best friends for 14 years but she’s been making new friends and deeper connections with other people and i feel like i’m just not as important anymore, probably because i was away for so long due to my new relationship and mental health issues. I feel myself longing for new friendships (not cutting ties with my old ones though) and just going out more and having deeper connections with other people. I used to be very outgoing but i feel like covid kinda ruined my social skills. i also think it’s important to note that i graduated in 2020 so i’m 21 now and i guess this is just the time in someone’s life where a lot of stuff changes. Plus, my relationship has been a roller coaster (on/off, lots of fighting) the past year and i think that contributed to the distance as wellEDIT: a big factor too i think is that my 5 closest friends moved in together ( not all five at once but 2 live together and the other three live together) I was supposed to move in with the 2 as well but life got in the way and i didn’t have a stable job after school to move out. I just feel lonely and I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience in their life and how they got through it. any help would be very much appreciated <3",""

Im sick of drinking atm. I haven’t drank and smoked anything since 4 weeks after a almost full weekend with him partying and drinking. And I feel very happy about it. I’m eating very healthy and I’m going almost daily to the gym. After that party weekend 4 weeks ago I had a lunge infection. I was 2 weeks straight sick. Im trying not to drink and smoke since then.I don’t want to go to the bar where he is celebrating (public bar), because I don’t want to get into the temptation to smoke cigarettes or drink. I don’t want to break my streak. He is a good friend, but certainly not my best.  Please tell me if I’m wrong thinking for my best for once. I’m a person who always says yes to everything and anyone and for once I want to say f*** it all. But I do care for him and I’m thinking if I’m in the wrong here?Btw.

I also shared things about my my past trauma from being bullied and the mistakes I made when I was younger.

"577","Difficult situation","TW; SUICIDAL THOUGHTS MENTIONED For context, I'm still in high school. So I have a partner that I've been with for 3 months and they are very sweet but I think we need to break up. They don't really talk to me a lot, don't try to invite me to things when our friend groupmakes plans but doesn't invite me, I'm the only one who tries to make plans to hang out after school, and they said I love you very fast. I do love them but I think in a more platonic way. They keep saying that we have so many good memories together but truth is we barely do so I'm really confused as to what they're thinking. Our conversations just feel really dry and they are significantly more affectionate towards our friends. I just don't think I'm allowed to break up with them. They recently said ""i don't think i could live without you"" which was really out of the blue and made me worry. They have struggled with suicidality for a while and I'm worried if I break up with them they'll commit. I don't want then to hurt themselves or worse. When I was trying to figure out if they were okay one time after they had a hard day I told them that I trusted them and they could trust me and I'd listen. They said they trusted me more than anyone and with their life. It's just that we hadn't been together super long. But even if we break up and my partner is physically okay, all of my friends will leave because they have more loyalties to my partner. I have literally been told that ""you guys aren't allowed to break up"" or ""if you hurt them I'll kill you"" ""itll be really awkward for me if you guys break up"" I understand the I'll kill you one is most likely just them being protective but still. They also say that my partner talks about me (in a positive way) but I feel like my partner rarely expresses any of that affection to me. I feel like such an asshole and I'm so stressed about it. My own mental health has never been great and this is making it way worse. I don't want my partner to commit, lose all of my friends, or both. What can I do?

I have been very jealous of her cousin since I met her and I’m not sure what to do with the feelings I’m having. Basically the reason I’m jealous is entirely on my girlfriend’s part. I do really like the cousin. I guess I’m worried deep down that she likes her cousin because she’s so weirdly possessive over her. I went on their two week family beach vacation last year for the first time, and the entire two weeks from the moment we woke up, to the moment we went to bed we would be with her cousin, because she refused to be apart from her. She does live in another state, so she says that’s the reason she does it. But to me it seems weird that she doesn’t want ANY alone time with me on vacation. I remember I asked if we could have some time alone and she got so upset with me. Also the things she comments on her instagram make me uncomfortable, as they’re kinda sexual comments. But it’s brushed off as her just joking and being girls. I also have similar features as the cousin, and I remember when we first started dating and we were talking about our types, my girlfriend described her cousin perfectly. It’s just a lot of things that make me feel insecure and jealous. My girlfriend is also very jealous of her cousin’s boyfriend because he takes time away from her, and she got jealous when her cousin brought friends to vacations as well. I get that it’s probably just because they don’t see each other often, but I have this feeling that I’ll always be second to her cousin and it makes me sad. I want to have a talk with her about it, but I don’t want to have that conversation of accusing my girlfriend of having a crush on her cousin.

"580","Should I take extra vacation days?","To give some background, I work in Engineering R&D. Recently work has been extremely busy with multiple projects and multiple tight deadlines. I'm part of R&D, and since the beginning of this year I've worked a lot of overtime, including several late nights and weekends collaborating with other engineers to meet a very high priority deadline and solving a critical issue. Management was extremely happy and we got congratulated. Since we don't get paid overtime (we're salaried) I asked my boss to give me an extra week paid time off on top of my regular vacation days to compensate for all the late nights. This was in late Feb. Although he approved it, we had another critical commitment the week of my request, so I got asked to postpone my holidays. I worked again to successfully meet the commitments and thought the world was calming down and decided to take a week off. Again, as fortune would have it, something critical popped up again and I spent the entirety of last week solving the problem with all hands on deck. Now I thought everything was actually good and I should be able to take my week off without any issues. So I booked my days, and returned home from work last night feeling relaxed. As fate would have it, I got messaged late last night with a request from a different team that we need to verify something critical and we only have a week. At this point I am having a breakdown because I'm extremely exhausted. I messaged my senior engineer to take care of this request if possible. He said he would look into it but didn't sound too happy about it. This whole situation has really been hurting my health both physically and mentally. I haven't been getting enough sleep and people tell me I look extremely exhausted. That's because I am! I'm handling multiple projects in parallel compared to other co-workers at my level. But taking this week off next week is making me feel extremely guilty, and am afraid that if shit hits the fan it will somehow be blamed on me. So I feel like I'll be unable to enjoy my week off. I'm considering postponing again but I am really really burnt out and need a recharge. So I guess I am asking for advice here. What do I do?",""
"581","Looking for options for our problematic farm dog","Hi all, I'm looking for a solution to an urgent situation with our farm dog.We have had this gorgeous, super smart but super sensitive english shepherd for two years and live in a semi-public setting (community farm with regular visitors). This dog can be the sweetest, loving-bordering-on-needy (hah) sweetheart, and he is very smart- he can learn tricks so fast and he loves to play frisbee. If he has a very attentive and clear handler, he is in his element. But he has not had a clear one person to work with and in our public environment he has gotten spooked/stressed and bit multiple people in completely unrelated events. A few bites were more minor but twice it was pretty bad and ended in a few stitches.We are at our unthinkable last options end. We have reached out to shelters and the breeder and still do not have a solution. We have arrived at the absolute last resort - to put him down.This is devastating, but we don't know what else to do and don't want more people in our environment to get harmed or feel unsafe.I think he would thrive in a quiet environment with one clear ""his person"" who is really wanting to work with him & lives on some land either alone or with one other person. At this point, I think he needs someone who has experience with dog behavior training or a specialist.

"582","Struggling with work and that's impacting my relationship","I don't really know where to start so I'll just go right in...this will be long, sorry. So.... I'm doing an apprenticeship in a warehouse at the moment (I'm in my last year) and we have to change departments every few months. Since last year (when I got my 2. vaccination ) I'm constantly ill with headaches so bad I can't move or diarrhea that doesn't let me go to work in that state and I had to call in a lot.Now see, when I'm at work I give my 150% and am one of the best apprentices (like some people I work with told me) and in school I also do very good (just straight 1 and 2 throughout my 3 years)The department I'm in now has a boss I just can't click with. I was ill the first two weeks where I should have been there. The boss was not amused and secretly (not obviously) had the opinion that I call in just because I don't want to work, which is absolutely not true. (how do I know? I see it in his eyes when he talks) I think the first impression he had of me is just super bad and now I hear him being passive aggressive every time he says something to me.I talked to a few colleagues and apprentices about that and they assured told me it could be a generational conflict because that guy is just a boomer with different work ethic, like coming to work to help your colleagues out even if you feel like shit and are ill and infect everyone. They say he doesn't take bullshit, especially not from people so young like me (I'm 23). The problem is, it is no bullshit. I would literally not be able to work with heavy machines safely if I have headache so bad or I would shit myself if I would go to work like that, but how can I prove that? Sure, I always call in before my shift, get a doctor's note and call again to tell my workplace how long I will be ill, but I have the feeling that they think it's not enough. That I'm shamed for not being able to perform a 40h workweek with much physical labor with my getting ill so often. That's one of the reasons why I always feel so bad about calling in, that I have to sit on the floor in an uncomfy position for about 1h after the phone call because I have to punish myself for not just going and trying. My head is done for the day too, I always think about how they probably talk bad about me behind my back or how they don't believe me, so that I literally can't get any rest on the days I call in. And thats super contraproductive if you're trying to get better to start working again.The best part is that I really really like my workplace, my colleagues etc (just not the boss of the department I'm now in) and I feel extra bad to let them down when I call in. I'm just so frustrated about the whole situation that I think about quitting all the time, or thinking about alternatives in life I could do without having to work so much or just giving up and living on the streets. There were days I drove to the doctors and thought while driving.... Now drive against that tree and then you will have at least 2 weeks no worries about work because you are at the hospital and they can't not believe I'm ill. When I type this it looks so wrong and I know I never actually want to be in such a situation but I can't help but think about that all the time when I'm overwhelmed.I have the feeling that somehow most people around me just happen to get it all together and don't have such a hard time with everything. I know that is probably not the case because everyone struggles somewhere in life, but are they really that bad? Am I the only one that dreads going to bed because then it is morning again and I have to repeat everything everyday for the next 45 years of my life? That sits on the floor for hours at a time and just cry because I'm overwhelmed and don't know what to do, how to adult? That can't get anything done after work because I need every single second to decompress from work and even that is not enough? If I have an appointment in the afternoon my day is ruined, like literally I cry myself to sleep ruined, because now instead of 6hours after work before I have to sleep I only have 3 or 4. (and I sleep about 5,5 to 6,5h a night, much too less, because otherwise I have even less time to decompress) Even things I want to do are not possible for me to do after work, like hanging with friends or something like that. I'm just at the end of my rope. I wish I could just live my life peacefully, roof over my head (I don't care how small), some food that I don't starve and that's it. Just let me alone and don't take over my life.... And I don't mean I don't want to work at all, just not the majority of my life for a wage that I can't even support myself alone.I hate having something like work dictate my life like it does that now. I work from 5-1:30pm every day, I have to wake up at 3:30, drive to work at 4:30 and come back around 2pm, do chores, buy groceries, appointments that I can't just not to because adult, go shower, make my lunch for the next day, cook dinner, eat, chill for 1/2 hours and go to sleepIf feels like my whole life is a chore with that schedule, just sleep, work, prepare for work the next day, sleep, repeatI feel even more bad that I feel like this because I know there are people with much more struggles, that work even longer hours, have even less time for themselves, or earn less than I do. The worst part is though, it impacts my relationship with my partner of nearly 6 years badly. Because I'm always stressed and have no time, my desire to have sex is super low. He always initiates and I have to turn him down a lot. I know not everybody has the same sex drive and all and he always reassures me it's not my fault that I have a low drive, but I genuinely fear that he will someday leave me because I can't give him what he needs. I see the sadness in his eyes when we can't make love, even though I want to, I can't. As I'm typing this I'm just crying in bed alone, while he takes time for himself (what is totally normal and we don't mind day to day) and I can't stop thinking about that I let him down and I don't deserve him. I don't want to turn him down but if I force myself to have sex with him (even though I'd love to) it just hurts and is uncomfortable and he notices that and stops, and it's even more bad as if I turned him down in the first place. He always asks me what I'd like to try and how it would feel better for me etc, so it's not like he is selfish. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately the mentions of sex or the absence of it if he talks to me about it makes me so sad and I feel so guilty not just being able to get in the mood when he tries everything to make it happen. I have to preface that I don't want to just break up and move on, neither does he (he always says he loves me, no matter how often we have sex, but that it is still super important to him because that's the only time he can really feel connected and loved because of his past trauma). (he got severely abused all his childhood and his teen years, it just stopped as he met me and he turned his life around) I don't even know what I want to achieve with this post, maybe just vent or get advice or hear others opinions...feel free to comment, but please be gentle, I'm highly sensitive....TLDR: I struggle with handling work and life as an adult in general and that makes my ability to be happy and sexually active in my relationship impossible most times",""

I reach out to my siblings and family members, mail gifts and try to show that they are important to me. Almost all of the time I am left on read, and never contacted back. I can call and leave messages, no one will call back.. ect That is unless there is a “family emergency”- in this case I am always contacted to help. Which I always do.. and it leaves me feeling overextended and used- as contact ends immediately after. This feeling of really being unwanted, and not needed in my family brings me so much mental agony. I cry often about it and just feel so alone. I guess I’m looking for some advice or insight if anyone else has struggled with this type of isolation. Thanks for any help",""
"588","Am I under social obligation to buy two chairs for my balcony?","I am still recovering from losing my family in 2021, and my cat and I have moved to an apartment building for people with disabilities or who are elderly (I am on disability and very poor.).  I really love it here, and I especially love that I can pay the bills here, without being in the red.  I have a very nice balcony on the seventh floor and am trying to get things for it, now that the weather is changing.  I looked at Walmart today, and I had an anxiety crisis at Walmart and left chairless.  The issue is that I really don't have a lot of money, and my choice is that I can either afford one nice chair that is really comfy, where I can sit outside with my cat and metabolize my vitamin D; or I can afford two plastic deck chairs that are pretty comfortable but not as good as the more expensive one (and the expensive one is pretty, while these are grey molded plastic).  I feel like I'm being a jerk if I just buy one chair though, because people will come over, and I will only have my own chair and nothing for them, and I am breaking some social contract.  But I also really want to just have a comfy chair that I can sit in and watch the sun rise, with my cat.  I wanted to hear the opinions of some people who don't find this to be an anxiety inducing, tear summoning conundrum to help me decide.  Thank you in advance for any help.",""

"590","How do I avoid hurting my best friend’s feelings?","As many of you know, the upcoming Mario movie is coming out soon and me and my best friend are both extremely excited for it. While some of my favorites include some of the older ones like Mario Galaxy and New Super Mario Bros, his favorite is Mario Odyssey. We played it together for about 3 hours one time, and I’ve even played some of it on my own a couple of times, and it’s not my cup of tea. Don’t get me wrong, I do think it’s a fun game to play in the moment especially with my friend, but it’s not something I’ve ever been eager to play. Even though he knows I’ve played it for a good chunk of time and that I’m not all that interested in it, he still insists that I finish the game because he knows there will be a scene in the new movie that features something with the ending of Odyssey. He really wants me to keep playing and brings up on a continuous basis to make sure I don’t forget, but I haven’t had any motivation or interest in doing so and I keep telling him I will before the movie comes out, but I’m really not interested in doing so and I keep putting it off. I don’t want to hurt his feelings with not playing it or end up coming off as a jerk either to him or in this post, but I also don’t want to spend hours of my time willingly doing something that I know doesn’t peak my interest all that much. What should I do?",""

"593","I told one of my friends to khs but I want to apologize correctly","Hi sorry if this may look or sound wrong but I have never written a Reddit post before. I 15f had a joking argument with one of my guy acquaintances were just gonna call him A during this argument he said that he was going to khs and in that moment my brain hadn’t thought about what he actually said so I just blurted out do it. In my mind I thought we were still joking but then after that he told his friends and they started to ask me why I would say that while still laughing so I went a long with it and continued to joke about it but two of A’s friends whom I’m also friends with hit me up and started to ask me why I would do that, and that it was messed up. I realized that what I said was wrong and insensitive not knowing what he was going through outside of school. I got A’s number through one of them and also said that I would apologize irl for it but I’m still not sure if that is enough for an apology. Pls let me know if there is another thing I can do or say to him as apology. (I’m not expecting to be forgiven I just want to show to him that I am sorry)",""
"594","I'm not a bridesmaid for a friend's wedding but I'm helping more than the actual bridesmaids","I want to preface this by saying I know that this is not my wedding and it's not about me in any way. I'm just struggling to know how to go forward. Some details: Bride and Groom - I have known the groom my entire life because he's always been close with my brother so he's like a brother to me (an actual brother, not like the brothers best friend stuff in books). I've known the Bride since they started dating (about 10 years). She's a bit different to me but we still get on well and even spend time together just us. They live in a town a few hours away so we don't see them a lot. MOH - maid of honor - my best friend. I've known her for about 5 years (she's married to another one of the guys in my brother's friend group). We are pretty much the same person with the same habits and thoughts about things so we are very close. I was her maid of honor. BM - Best Man - one of my brothers. The wedding is in two months time. Its in a place about 4 hours away so we're staying the night before and night of there. I hoped to be a bridesmaid but was completely ok with it when I found out I wouldn't be one. My issue is that MOH and I are doing a huge amount of work to prepare for the wedding and other activities while the other bridesmaids are doing nothing. MOHs comment was that I'm an undercover bridesmaid because I'm doing everything behind the scenes but I don't get to be seen as one. She can't understand why Bride doesn't want to make me one. She's also a bit upset that Bride and Groom did nothing to help for her wedding yet she's doing a lot for theirs. My non BM brother says she's jealous of my friendship with MOH which is why she won't make me one. My mum thinks I should tell her I'm only going to help with a few things but I'm not in the bridal party so I shouldn't be doing as much as I am. I feel that I'm happy to help because they're my friends and I want them to have a good day. I also don't want to leave all the burden on MOHs shoulders because she's already stressed about it. But I am a bit hurt that she wants me to do so much but when it comes to the actual wedding I'm not a bridesmaid and I won't be sitting at their table and I don't really feel part of it. I'm even taking leave from work to go a day early to help set up, which the other bridesmaids won't be there until the actual day. The one even told a friend of mine that she doesn't understand why she was even asked to be a bridesmaid. I guess I just need a non biased opinion on whether I'm overthinking this whole thing or if my mum is right that I'm being used. Do I need to talk to the bride about all this or just let everything be? I'm worried this may cause me (and maybe MOH) to build up resentment towards her.",""
"595","I need advice. I'm pet sitting for a family and I think I need to cut it short and leave early.","Hey everyone. So I am pet sitting for a family. There is a dog and 5 cats. They are out of the country at the moment and honestly their house is unbearable. For context. I've owned 2 cats in my lifetime (had them their whole lives- 8 weeks to 18 and 21 years respectively) and I've owned 8 dogs (again, their entire lives until natural death). The dog is so horribly trained that he's caused me a couple of bodily injuries such as scratches and a bruise on my ribs from jumping into me. He doesn't know a SINGLE command. I've asked the owners what commands he knows (to see if it's a different language as he isn't listening to english) and nothing they claim works for him. The cats..... they are mean. They swat randomly, grab onto my hair jump onto the kitchen counter while I'm preparing food or eating (which is DISGUSTING- cats step into litter with bodily fluids, then they step onto counters with their nasty feet, gross). They also meow and scratch, and fight with eachother at the bedroom door at ALLLL hours of the night. I haven't slept more than 2-3h every night for 2 weeks. (Yes I got ear plugs, they are so loud I can still hear them)I can easily tell that the dog has not had a SINGLE minute of training, and the cats just do whatever the hell they please, at all hours of day and night. I cant take it anymore. It's been 2 weeks, and I'm miserable. And there is another 10 days, I can't do it anymore. Anyone have any advice? What would you do in this situation?",""
"596","Should I tell online friend that sometimes I disappear or stop being active in our community not because I don't care but because I have mental health issues?","Hey,So super short summary. I'm 27M and recently been doing super good. Absolutely killing it at work, getting promotions often. Working on further university education, traveling a bit. But I used to struggle with depression a whole lot. Wouldn't leave my apartment other than to work and I'd sleep most of the time. Then when things got critical I started therapy. It's been a long couple of years but I'm definitely doing much much better but it's still like a shadow looming over me during some days. Occasionally it creeps up on me and I kinda disappear from the world around me again for a bit. Although I'm much better at dealing with this now it still makes stop attending our discord groups events. My good friend runs a community basically. I help out with creating some promotional materials, tech support and organize events too. But when this bad phase comes I kinda stop being active in the community and my projects are on hold because I have no energy to work on them. And I always just tell my friend that I'm busy. But recently I've been thinking it could help to just be honest and let him know what the situation is. So he doesn't think I don't care about the community or the friendship. Do you think this is a good idea?",""
